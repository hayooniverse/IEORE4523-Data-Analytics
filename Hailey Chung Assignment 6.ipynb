       "'\\nKate Atkinson MBE (born 20 December 1951) is an English writer of novels, plays and short stories.[1]  She has written historical novels, detective novels and family novels, incorporating postmodern and magical realist elements into the plots. Her debut, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, won the Whitbread Book Award, the precursor to the Costa Book Award, in 1995. The novels Life After Life and A God in Ruins won the Costa Book Award for novel in 2013 and 2015. She is also known for the Jackson Brodie series of detective novels, which has been adapted into the BBC One series, Case Histories.[2][3]\\nThe daughter of a shopkeeper, Atkinson was born in York, the setting for several of her books.[4] She was an only child and often had to finds ways to amuse herself. She describes herself as an anxious child, something she believes had to do with being illegitimate. Her parents lived together but were not married, because her mother could not divorce her first husband. At the time, that was  considered scandalous.[5]\\nShe studied English literature at the University of Dundee, gaining her master\\'s degree in 1974.[2] Atkinson subsequently studied for a doctorate in American literature, with a thesis titled \"The post-modern American short story in its historical context\".[4] Postmodern stylistic elements can be found in her own literary work. She failed at the viva (oral examination) stage. After leaving the university, she took on a variety of jobs, from home help to legal secretary and teacher, until her breakthrough as a writer in 1995.[6]\\nAtkinson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to literature.[7] In 2015, she became the first author to win a Costa Book Award three times when her book A God in Ruins won the Novel of the Year award.[8][9] On 30 November 2018, she was the guest on BBC Radio 4\\'s Desert Island Discs.[10]  She currently lives in Edinburgh.\\nAtkinson was in her thirties when she began writing short stories. One of her stories won a prize in a Woman\\'s Own writing contest in 1986, which encouraged her to continue writing, and she published stories in several magazines and newspapers. She has said that writing short stories was a good learning experience because she was forced to tell her story as efficiently as possible. In 1993, she won the Ian St. James Award for the story Karmic Mothers-Fact or Fiction? This is a story about two women who are both recovering from a suicide attempt in a hospital room next to the maternity ward. In 1997, the story was dapted for television.[5]\\nIn 1995 she published her first novel, the tragicomic Behind the Scenes at the Museum. Based on the childhood memories of young woman Ruby Lennox, the novel tells the story of a family during World War I and World War II. The book went on to be a Sunday Times bestseller and at once established her name as a writer. Some critics, however, dismissed it as a feminist manifesto. Behind the Scenes at the Museum was awarded the Whitbread Prize in the categories of “best debut,” and “Book of the Year.” The latter led to some commotion in the media; the debut novel by the unknown Atkinson had been selected over the winner in the “best novel” category, The Moor\\'s Last Sigh by Salman Rushdie.[5] Behind the Scenes at the Museum has been adapted for radio and stage. Atkinson herself wrote the screenplay for a television adaptation.\\nIn her next two novels, Human Croquet (1997) and Emotionally Weird (2000), Atkinson experimented with different stylistic elements and narrative techniques. In Emotionally Weird, for example, she uses different fonts to distinguish characters and locations. In 2000, her play \\'Abandonment premiered in Edinburgh. In 2002 she published a collection of short stories entitled Not the End of the World.[5]\\nIn 2004, Case Histories, a novel centered around the private investigator Jackson Brodie, was published; he was Atkinson\\'s first male protagonist. Three more Brodie novels followed: One Good Turn (2006), When Will There Be Good News? (2008) and Started Early Took My Dog (2010). The series was adapted for television with Jason Isaacs as Jackson Brodie.[5]\\nIn 2009, she donated the short story \"Lucky We Live Now\" to Oxfam\\'s Ox-Tales project, which consisted of four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Atkinson\\'s story was published in the Earth collection.[11][12]\\nShe followed up the Brodie-series with three novels set during World War II. The highly successful novel Life After Life (2013) is a combination of science fiction, historical novel and psychological fiction. Over the course of the story, the main character Ursula Todd dies several times, only to be born again and again in the year 1910 and start her life anew. In each new life, Ursula must make choices that turn out to influence the course of history. Life After Life received the Costa Book Award for Novel in 2013, and was adapted for television in 2022 .\\nAtkinson\\'s next novel A God in Ruins (2015) follows the life of Ursula\\'s brother Teddy Todd who is a pilot in the Royal Air Force during the war, but is more realistic than Life After Life. This book also won the Costa Book Award for Novel. Readers and critics generally have most praise for Life After Life because of its unusual structure and originality, but Atkinson herself considers A God in Ruins her best work. The main character of Transcription (2018) is a woman who worked for MI5 during the Second World War.[13]\\nBig Sky, Atkinsons fifth novel centered about detective Jackson Brodie was published in 2019. After a number of books about World War II, Atkinson wanted to write about a different theme. The storyline of Big Sky was originally intended for a TV series about a female detective, to be played by Victoria Wood. After Wood\\'s unexpected death in 2016, Atkinson decided to use the plot for the next novel in her Brodie cycle.[5]\\nShrines of Gaiety (2022) is set in the London nightclub milieu shortly after World War II. Normal rules don\\'t apply (2023) was her first collection of short stories since 2002. In 2024  Death at the sign of the rook  was published, the sixth Jackson Brodie novel, conceived during the corona pandemic. The story is set in an English country house; it pays homage to Agatha Christie and other writers from “the golden age of the British detective novel” between World War I and World War II.[13]\\nIn Kate Atkinson\\'s novels and stories, much is not what it seems at first glance. She combines the conventional forms of the historical novel, detective novel and family novel with postmodern or magical realist elements. Atkinson is fascinated by the role of chance in life, and this is a recurring theme in her stories. Her books present a succession of (unexpected) events and extraordinary characters. Main characters sometimes face periods of mental confusion or amnesia. Atkinson also plays with the chronology of events, both within one book and between different books. Some characters return as older or younger versions of themselves. Problems experienced in the present are often caused by painful past events, that sometimes have been concealed for generations.[1]\\nAtkinson herself has said that it is not possible to write a novel about happy people, who are just busy being happy.  In her work,  especially in the Brodie cycle, she also refers to current events. The theme of justice plays an important role in her stories.[5]\\nHer books contain humor and the narrative tone of voice is often mildly ironic.[1]\\nThe first four Jackson Brodie novels have been adapted by other writers for the BBC under the series titled Case Histories, featuring Jason Isaacs as Brodie.[3]\\nIn 2015 in the United States, Shonda Rhimes was in the process of developing a pilot called The Catch, based on a treatment written by Atkinson, and starring Mireille Enos.[18][19]\\nHer 2013 novel Life After Life was screened as a BBC drama of the same name in 2022, with Thomasin McKenzie in the role of Ursula.[20]\\nAtkinson\\'s work has received awards in the United Kingdom, France and the United States. She has asked her publishers to stop submitting her books for awards. Above all, she wants to meet her own quality standards\\n'"

      "[5]\n",
      "In 2004, Case Histories, a novel centered around the private investigator Jackson Brodie, was published; he was Atkinson's first male protagonist.\n",
      "The novels Life After Life and A God in Ruins won the Costa Book Award for novel in 2013 and 2015.\n",
      "After a number of books about World War II, Atkinson wanted to write about a different theme.\n",
      "Atkinson's next novel A God in Ruins (2015) follows the life of Ursula's brother Teddy Todd who is a pilot in the Royal Air Force during the war, but is more realistic than Life After Life.\n",
      "She is also known for the Jackson Brodie series of detective novels, which has been adapted into the BBC One series, Case Histories.\n",
      "Life After Life received the Costa Book Award for Novel in 2013, and was adapted for television in 2022 .\n",
      "Atkinson is fascinated by the role of chance in life, and this is a recurring theme in her stories.\n",
      "[11][12]\n",
      "She followed up the Brodie-series with three novels set during World War II.\n",
      "Atkinson's story was published in the Earth collection.\n",
      "Behind the Scenes at the Museum was awarded the Whitbread Prize in the categories of “best debut,” and “Book of the Year.” The latter led to some commotion in the media; the debut novel by the unknown Atkinson had been selected over the winner in the “best novel” category, The Moor's Last Sigh by Salman Rushdie.\n",
      "[13]\n",
      "Big Sky, Atkinsons fifth novel centered about detective Jackson Brodie was published in 2019.\n",
      "In 2002 she published a collection of short stories entitled Not the End of the World.\n",
      "After Wood's unexpected death in 2016, Atkinson decided to use the plot for the next novel in her Brodie cycle.\n",
      "[7] In 2015, she became the first author to win a Costa Book Award three times when her book A God in Ruins won the Novel of the Year award.\n",
      "[1]\n",
      "The first four Jackson Brodie novels have been adapted by other writers for the BBC under the series titled Case Histories, featuring Jason Isaacs as Brodie.\n",
      "[2][3]\n",
      "The daughter of a shopkeeper, Atkinson was born in York, the setting for several of her books.\n",
      "In 1993, she won the Ian St. James Award for the story Karmic Mothers-Fact or Fiction?\n",
      "Atkinson was in her thirties when she began writing short stories.\n",
      "[5]\n",
      "In 2009, she donated the short story \"Lucky We Live Now\" to Oxfam's Ox-Tales project, which consisted of four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors.\n",
      "The story is set in an English country house; it pays homage to Agatha Christie and other writers from “the golden age of the British detective novel” between World War I and World War II.\n",
      "[2] Atkinson subsequently studied for a doctorate in American literature, with a thesis titled \"The post-modern American short story in its historical context\".\n",
      "Atkinson also plays with the chronology of events, both within one book and between different books.\n",
      "Readers and critics generally have most praise for Life After Life because of its unusual structure and originality, but Atkinson herself considers A God in Ruins her best work.\n",
      "[20]\n",
      "Atkinson's work has received awards in the United Kingdom, France and the United States.\n",
