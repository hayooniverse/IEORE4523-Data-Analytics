       "'\\nKate Atkinson MBE (born 20 December 1951) is an English writer of novels, plays and short stories.[1]  She has written historical novels, detective novels and family novels, incorporating postmodern and magical realist elements into the plots. Her debut, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, won the Whitbread Book Award, the precursor to the Costa Book Award, in 1995. The novels Life After Life and A God in Ruins won the Costa Book Award for novel in 2013 and 2015. She is also known for the Jackson Brodie series of detective novels, which has been adapted into the BBC One series, Case Histories.[2][3]\\nThe daughter of a shopkeeper, Atkinson was born in York, the setting for several of her books.[4] She was an only child and often had to finds ways to amuse herself. She describes herself as an anxious child, something she believes had to do with being illegitimate. Her parents lived together but were not married, because her mother could not divorce her first husband. At the time, that was  considered scandalous.[5]\\nShe studied English literature at the University of Dundee, gaining her master\\'s degree in 1974.[2] Atkinson subsequently studied for a doctorate in American literature, with a thesis titled \"The post-modern American short story in its historical context\".[4] Postmodern stylistic elements can be found in her own literary work. She failed at the viva (oral examination) stage. After leaving the university, she took on a variety of jobs, from home help to legal secretary and teacher, until her breakthrough as a writer in 1995.[6]\\nAtkinson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to literature.[7] In 2015, she became the first author to win a Costa Book Award three times when her book A God in Ruins won the Novel of the Year award.[8][9] On 30 November 2018, she was the guest on BBC Radio 4\\'s Desert Island Discs.[10]  She currently lives in Edinburgh.\\nAtkinson was in her thirties when she began writing short stories. One of her stories won a prize in a Woman\\'s Own writing contest in 1986, which encouraged her to continue writing, and she published stories in several magazines and newspapers. She has said that writing short stories was a good learning experience because she was forced to tell her story as efficiently as possible. In 1993, she won the Ian St. James Award for the story Karmic Mothers-Fact or Fiction? This is a story about two women who are both recovering from a suicide attempt in a hospital room next to the maternity ward. In 1997, the story was dapted for television.[5]\\nIn 1995 she published her first novel, the tragicomic Behind the Scenes at the Museum. Based on the childhood memories of young woman Ruby Lennox, the novel tells the story of a family during World War I and World War II. The book went on to be a Sunday Times bestseller and at once established her name as a writer. Some critics, however, dismissed it as a feminist manifesto. Behind the Scenes at the Museum was awarded the Whitbread Prize in the categories of “best debut,” and “Book of the Year.” The latter led to some commotion in the media; the debut novel by the unknown Atkinson had been selected over the winner in the “best novel” category, The Moor\\'s Last Sigh by Salman Rushdie.[5] Behind the Scenes at the Museum has been adapted for radio and stage. Atkinson herself wrote the screenplay for a television adaptation.\\nIn her next two novels, Human Croquet (1997) and Emotionally Weird (2000), Atkinson experimented with different stylistic elements and narrative techniques. In Emotionally Weird, for example, she uses different fonts to distinguish characters and locations. In 2000, her play \\'Abandonment premiered in Edinburgh. In 2002 she published a collection of short stories entitled Not the End of the World.[5]\\nIn 2004, Case Histories, a novel centered around the private investigator Jackson Brodie, was published; he was Atkinson\\'s first male protagonist. Three more Brodie novels followed: One Good Turn (2006), When Will There Be Good News? (2008) and Started Early Took My Dog (2010). The series was adapted for television with Jason Isaacs as Jackson Brodie.[5]\\nIn 2009, she donated the short story \"Lucky We Live Now\" to Oxfam\\'s Ox-Tales project, which consisted of four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Atkinson\\'s story was published in the Earth collection.[11][12]\\nShe followed up the Brodie-series with three novels set during World War II. The highly successful novel Life After Life (2013) is a combination of science fiction, historical novel and psychological fiction. Over the course of the story, the main character Ursula Todd dies several times, only to be born again and again in the year 1910 and start her life anew. In each new life, Ursula must make choices that turn out to influence the course of history. Life After Life received the Costa Book Award for Novel in 2013, and was adapted for television in 2022 .\\nAtkinson\\'s next novel A God in Ruins (2015) follows the life of Ursula\\'s brother Teddy Todd who is a pilot in the Royal Air Force during the war, but is more realistic than Life After Life. This book also won the Costa Book Award for Novel. Readers and critics generally have most praise for Life After Life because of its unusual structure and originality, but Atkinson herself considers A God in Ruins her best work. The main character of Transcription (2018) is a woman who worked for MI5 during the Second World War.[13]\\nBig Sky, Atkinsons fifth novel centered about detective Jackson Brodie was published in 2019. After a number of books about World War II, Atkinson wanted to write about a different theme. The storyline of Big Sky was originally intended for a TV series about a female detective, to be played by Victoria Wood. After Wood\\'s unexpected death in 2016, Atkinson decided to use the plot for the next novel in her Brodie cycle.[5]\\nShrines of Gaiety (2022) is set in the London nightclub milieu shortly after World War II. Normal rules don\\'t apply (2023) was her first collection of short stories since 2002. In 2024  Death at the sign of the rook  was published, the sixth Jackson Brodie novel, conceived during the corona pandemic. The story is set in an English country house; it pays homage to Agatha Christie and other writers from “the golden age of the British detective novel” between World War I and World War II.[13]\\nIn Kate Atkinson\\'s novels and stories, much is not what it seems at first glance. She combines the conventional forms of the historical novel, detective novel and family novel with postmodern or magical realist elements. Atkinson is fascinated by the role of chance in life, and this is a recurring theme in her stories. Her books present a succession of (unexpected) events and extraordinary characters. Main characters sometimes face periods of mental confusion or amnesia. Atkinson also plays with the chronology of events, both within one book and between different books. Some characters return as older or younger versions of themselves. Problems experienced in the present are often caused by painful past events, that sometimes have been concealed for generations.[1]\\nAtkinson herself has said that it is not possible to write a novel about happy people, who are just busy being happy.  In her work,  especially in the Brodie cycle, she also refers to current events. The theme of justice plays an important role in her stories.[5]\\nHer books contain humor and the narrative tone of voice is often mildly ironic.[1]\\nThe first four Jackson Brodie novels have been adapted by other writers for the BBC under the series titled Case Histories, featuring Jason Isaacs as Brodie.[3]\\nIn 2015 in the United States, Shonda Rhimes was in the process of developing a pilot called The Catch, based on a treatment written by Atkinson, and starring Mireille Enos.[18][19]\\nHer 2013 novel Life After Life was screened as a BBC drama of the same name in 2022, with Thomasin McKenzie in the role of Ursula.[20]\\nAtkinson\\'s work has received awards in the United Kingdom, France and the United States. She has asked her publishers to stop submitting her books for awards. Above all, she wants to meet her own quality standards\\n'"

      "[5]\n",
      "In 2004, Case Histories, a novel centered around the private investigator Jackson Brodie, was published; he was Atkinson's first male protagonist.\n",
      "The novels Life After Life and A God in Ruins won the Costa Book Award for novel in 2013 and 2015.\n",
      "After a number of books about World War II, Atkinson wanted to write about a different theme.\n",
      "Atkinson's next novel A God in Ruins (2015) follows the life of Ursula's brother Teddy Todd who is a pilot in the Royal Air Force during the war, but is more realistic than Life After Life.\n",
      "She is also known for the Jackson Brodie series of detective novels, which has been adapted into the BBC One series, Case Histories.\n",
      "Life After Life received the Costa Book Award for Novel in 2013, and was adapted for television in 2022 .\n",
      "Atkinson is fascinated by the role of chance in life, and this is a recurring theme in her stories.\n",
      "[11][12]\n",
      "She followed up the Brodie-series with three novels set during World War II.\n",
      "Atkinson's story was published in the Earth collection.\n",
      "Behind the Scenes at the Museum was awarded the Whitbread Prize in the categories of “best debut,” and “Book of the Year.” The latter led to some commotion in the media; the debut novel by the unknown Atkinson had been selected over the winner in the “best novel” category, The Moor's Last Sigh by Salman Rushdie.\n",
      "[13]\n",
      "Big Sky, Atkinsons fifth novel centered about detective Jackson Brodie was published in 2019.\n",
      "In 2002 she published a collection of short stories entitled Not the End of the World.\n",
      "After Wood's unexpected death in 2016, Atkinson decided to use the plot for the next novel in her Brodie cycle.\n",
      "[7] In 2015, she became the first author to win a Costa Book Award three times when her book A God in Ruins won the Novel of the Year award.\n",
      "[1]\n",
      "The first four Jackson Brodie novels have been adapted by other writers for the BBC under the series titled Case Histories, featuring Jason Isaacs as Brodie.\n",
      "[2][3]\n",
      "The daughter of a shopkeeper, Atkinson was born in York, the setting for several of her books.\n",
      "In 1993, she won the Ian St. James Award for the story Karmic Mothers-Fact or Fiction?\n",
      "Atkinson was in her thirties when she began writing short stories.\n",
      "[5]\n",
      "In 2009, she donated the short story \"Lucky We Live Now\" to Oxfam's Ox-Tales project, which consisted of four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors.\n",
      "The story is set in an English country house; it pays homage to Agatha Christie and other writers from “the golden age of the British detective novel” between World War I and World War II.\n",
      "[2] Atkinson subsequently studied for a doctorate in American literature, with a thesis titled \"The post-modern American short story in its historical context\".\n",
      "Atkinson also plays with the chronology of events, both within one book and between different books.\n",
      "Readers and critics generally have most praise for Life After Life because of its unusual structure and originality, but Atkinson herself considers A God in Ruins her best work.\n",
      "[20]\n",
      "Atkinson's work has received awards in the United Kingdom, France and the United States.\n",

       " ['The Western is a film genre defined by the American Film Institute as films which are \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle, and the demise of the new frontier.\"[1] Generally set in the American frontier between the California Gold Rush of 1849 and the closing of the frontier in 1890,[2]:\\u200a557\\u200a the genre also includes many examples of stories set in locations outside the frontier – including Northern Mexico, the Northwestern United States, Alaska, and Western Canada – as well as stories that take place before 1849 and after 1890. Western films comprise part of the larger Western genre, which encompasses literature, music, television, and plastic arts.\\nWestern films derive from the Wild West shows that began in the 1870s.[3]:\\u200a48\\u200a Originally referred to as \"Wild West dramas\", the shortened term \"Western\" came to describe the genre.[4]  Although other Western films were made earlier, The Great Train Robbery (1903) is often considered to mark the beginning of the genre.[2][5] Westerns were a major genre during the silent era (1894–1929) and continued to grow in popularity during the sound era (post–1929). \\nThe genre reached its pinnacle between 1945 and 1965 when it comprised roughly a quarter of studio output.[6] The advent of color and widescreen during this era opened up new possibilities for directors to portray the vastness of the American landscape.[3]:\\u200a105\\u200a This era also produced the genre\\'s most iconic figures, including John Wayne and Randolph Scott, who developed personae that they maintained across most of their films.[7] Director John Ford is often considered one of the genre\\'s greatest filmmakers.[8]\\nWith the proliferation of television in the 1960s, television Westerns began to supersede film Westerns in popularity.[9] By the end of the decade, studios had mostly ceased to make Westerns. Despite their dwindling popularity during this decade, the 1960s gave rise to the revisionist Western, several examples of which became vital entries in the canon.[10]\\nSince the 1960s, new Western films have only appeared sporadically. Despite their decreased prominence, Western films remain an integral part of American culture and national mythology.[11][12]\\nThe American Film Institute defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle, and the demise of the new frontier\".[1]  The term \"Western\", used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in Motion Picture World magazine.[13]\\nMost of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular Western fiction, and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.[14][page\\xa0needed]  Film critic Philip French has said that the Western is \"a commercial formula with rules as fixed and immutable as the Kabuki Theater.\"[15]:\\u200a12\\u200a\\nWestern films commonly feature protagonists such as sheriffs, cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as seminomadic wanderers who wear Stetson hats, bandannas, spurs, and buckskins, use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.[16]\\nFilm Westerns derive from the Wild West shows that began in the 1870s.[3]:\\u200a48\\u200a These shows, which included stage plays and outdoor exhibitions, culminated in Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West, a touring performance that ran from 1883 to 1913. Wild West shows, which were intended for urban audiences, established many of the elements that came to define Western films, such as the blending of fact and fiction and the romanticization of the frontier.[17] These early films were originally referred to as \"Wild West dramas\", the term \"Western\" came to describe the genre. The use of this shortened term appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in Motion Picture World magazine.[4]\\nThe first films that belong to the Western genre are a series of short single reel silents made in 1894 by Edison Studios at their Black Maria studio in West Orange, New Jersey. These featured veterans of Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West show exhibiting skills acquired by living in the Old West – they included Annie Oakley (shooting) and members of the Sioux (dancing).[18]\\nWestern films were enormously popular in the silent-film era (1894–1927). The earliest known Western narrative film is the British short Kidnapping by Indians, made by Mitchell and Kenyon in Blackburn, England, in 1899.[19][20] The Great Train Robbery (1903, based on the earlier British film A Daring Daylight Burglary), Edwin S. Porter\\'s film starring Broncho Billy Anderson, is often erroneously cited as the first Western, though George N. Fenin and William K. Everson point out that the \"Edison company had played with Western material for several years prior to The Great Train Robbery\". Nonetheless, they concur that Porter\\'s film \"set the pattern—of crime, pursuit, and retribution—for the Western film as a genre\".[21] The film\\'s popularity opened the door for Anderson to become the screen\\'s first Western star; he made several hundred Western film shorts. So popular was the genre that he soon faced competition from Tom Mix and William S. Hart.[22]\\nWith the advent of sound in 1927–28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,[23] leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as Dodge City starring Errol Flynn, Jesse James with Tyrone Power, Union Pacific with Joel McCrea, Destry Rides Again featuring James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich, and especially John Ford\\'s landmark Western adventure Stagecoach  starring John Wayne, which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, Stagecoach made John Wayne a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B Westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen 10 years earlier as the leading man in director Raoul Walsh\\'s spectacular widescreen The Big Trail, which failed at the box office in spite of being shot on location across the American West, including the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and the giant redwoods, due in part to exhibitors\\' inability to switch over to widescreen during the Great Depression.\\nAfter the renewed commercial successes of the Western in the late 1930s, their popularity continued to rise until the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.[24]\\nThe period from 1940 to 1960 has been called the \"Golden Age of the Western\".[25] It is epitomized by the work of several prominent directors including:\\nThere have been several instances of resurgence for the Western genre. According to Netflix, the popularity of the genre is due to its malleability: \"As America has evolved, so too have Westerns.\"[26]\\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Spaghetti Westerns from Italy became popular worldwide; this was due to the success of Sergio Leone\\'s storytelling method.[27][28]\\nAlthough experiencing waning popularity during the 1980s, the success of films such as Dances with Wolves (1990) and Unforgiven (1992) brought the genre back into the mainstream.[26] Back to the Future Part III (1990) was \"a full-blown Western\" set in 1885; although the least commercially successful of the trilogy and according to some a departure from the 1985 original (a sci-fi) and the 1989 sequel (an action adventure), Part III has been regarded by others as a fitting end to the series.[29]\\nAt the turn of the 21st century, Westerns have once again seen an ongoing revival in popularity.[30][31] Largely influenced by the recapturing of Americana mythology, appreciation for the vaquero folklore within Mexican culture and the US Southwest, interest in the Western lifestyle\\'s music and clothing, along with popular videos games series such as Red Dead.[32][33][34][35]\\nScreenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies Western films as one of eleven super-genres in his screenwriters\\' taxonomy, claiming that all feature length narrative films can be classified by these super-genres. The other ten super-genres are action, crime, fantasy, horror, romance, science fiction, slice of life, sports, thriller, and war.[36]\\nWestern films often depict conflicts with Native Americans. While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the Native Americans as dishonorable villains,[37] the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.[38]  Other recurring themes of Westerns include treks (e.g. The Big Trail)[39] or perilous journeys (e.g. Stagecoach)[40] or groups of bandits terrorizing small towns such as in The Magnificent Seven.[41]\\nThe Western goes beyond simply a cinematic genre, and extends into defining the myth of the West in American culture.[15]:\\u200a21–22\\u200a\\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, or Wyoming. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains, and epic canyons.[42] Productions were also filmed on location at movie ranches.[43]\\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film.[42] After the early 1950s, various widescreen formats such as Cinemascope (1953) and VistaVision used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular western landscapes.[44][45] John Ford\\'s use of Monument Valley as an expressive landscape in his films from Stagecoach to Cheyenne Autumn (1965), \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".[46]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nTelevision Westerns are programs with settings in the later half of the 19th century in the American Old West, Western Canada and Mexico during the period from about 1860 to the end of the so-called \"Indian Wars\". More recent entries in the Western genre have used the neo-Western subgenre, placing events in the modern day, or the space Western subgenre but still draw inspiration from the outlaw attitudes prevalent in traditional Western productions.\\nWhen television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite, with 30 such shows airing at prime time by 1959. Traditional Westerns faded in popularity in the late 1960s, while new shows fused Western elements with other types of shows, such as family drama, mystery thrillers, and crime drama. In the 1990s and 2000s, slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced.\\nThe Saturday Afternoon Matinee on the radio were a pre-television phenomenon in the US which often featured Western series. Film Westerns turned John Wayne, Ken Maynard, Audie Murphy, Tom Mix, and Johnny Mack Brown into major idols of a young audience, plus \"singing cowboys\" such as Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, Dick Foran, Rex Allen, Tex Ritter, Ken Curtis, and Bob Steele. Each cowboy had a co-starring horse such as Rogers\\' Golden Palomino, Trigger, who became a star in his own right.\\nOther B-movie series were Lash LaRue and the Durango Kid. Herbert Jeffreys, as Bob Blake with his horse Stardust, appeared in a number of movies made for African American audiences in the days of segregated movie theaters.[1] Bill Pickett, an African-American rodeo performer, also appeared in early Western films for the same audience.[2]\\nWhen the popularity of television exploded in the late 1940s and 1950s, Westerns quickly became a staple of small-screen entertainment. The first, on June 24, 1949, was the Hopalong Cassidy show, at first edited from the 66 films made by William Boyd. Many B-movie Westerns were aired on TV as time fillers, while a number of long-running TV Westerns became classics in their own right. The earliest TV Westerns were written primarily for a children\\'s audience; it was not until the near-concurrent debuts of The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp and the TV version of Gunsmoke in 1955 that adult Westerns appeared on television,[3] and the genre became enormously popular.[4] Notable TV Westerns include The Lone Ranger with Clayton Moore, The Gene Autry Show with Gene Autry, Gunsmoke with James Arness, Cheyenne with Clint Walker, Have Gun – Will Travel with Richard Boone, Sugarfoot with Will Hutchins, Wagon Train with Ward Bond and Robert Horton, Maverick with James Garner and Jack Kelly, Trackdown with Robert Culp, Wanted Dead or Alive with Steve McQueen, Bronco with Ty Hardin, Bat Masterson with Gene Barry, The Rifleman, Rawhide with Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood, Bonanza with Pernell Roberts and Dan Blocker, Laramie, The Virginian with James Drury and Doug McClure, The Big Valley with Barbara Stanwyck, The High Chaparral, and many others.\\nBy 1959, four years after the boom in TV Westerns began, thirty such shows were on television during prime time; none had been canceled that season, while 14 new ones had appeared. In one week in March 1959, eight of the top ten shows were Westerns, and an estimated $125 million in toys based on TV Westerns would be sold that year. Many were \"four-wall Westerns\", filmed indoors in three days or less with scripts of poor quality, and the genre\\'s enormous popularity mystified even its creators; TIME quoted one of the about 100 writers for TV Westerns as wondering \"I don\\'t get it. Why do people want to spend so much time staring at the wrong end of a horse?\"[4]\\nA horse cost up to $100 a day, compared to $22.05 for an extra;[4] increasing production costs caused most action half-hour series vanishing in the early 1960s to be replaced by hour long television shows, increasingly in color.[5] Two unusual Western series of this era are Zorro, set in early California under Spanish rule, and the British/Australian Western Whiplash set in 1850/60\\'s Australia with four scripts by Gene Roddenberry.\\nTraditional Westerns began to disappear from television in the late 1960s and early 1970s as color television became ubiquitous. With the exception of the short-lived The Cowboys in 1974, 1968 was the last season any new traditional Westerns debuted on television; by 1969, after pressure from parental advocacy groups who claimed Westerns were too violent for television, all three of the major networks ceased airing new Western series.[6] Demographic pressures and overall burnout from the format may have also been a factor as viewers became bored and disinterested with the glut of Westerns on the air at the time.[7] By 1971, production companies had acknowledged that \"the Western idea is out.\"[8] The two last traditional Westerns, Death Valley Days and Gunsmoke, ended their runs in 1975.\\nWhile the traditional Westerns mostly died out in the late 1960s, more modernized Westerns, incorporating story concepts from outside the traditional genre, began appearing on television shortly thereafter. A number of the new shows downplayed the traditional violent elements of Westerns, for example by having the main characters go unarmed and/or seek to avoid conflicts, or by emphasizing fantasy, comedy or family themes. The Wild Wild West, which ran from 1965 to 1969, combined Westerns with science fiction (what later would be termed steampunk) and an espionage-thriller format in the spirit of the recently popularized James Bond franchise. F Troop was a satirical sitcom that made fun of the genre. The limited-run McCloud, which premiered in 1970, was essentially a fusion of the sheriff-oriented Western with the modern big-city crime drama. Its companion series Hec Ramsey was a lighthearted who-dunnit mystery series set in the late Western era, starring Richard Boone (previously of the traditional Western Have Gun, Will Travel; Boone described the characters in each series as very similar[9]) as a retired gunfighter turned detective. Cimarron Strip, a lavish 90-minute 1967 series starring Stuart Whitman as a U.S. Marshal, was canceled after a single season primarily because of its unprecedented expense. Nichols featured former Maverick star James Garner as a motorcycle-riding, unarmed peacemaker in a late-era Western setting. The low-budget sitcom Dusty\\'s Trail was an Old West adaptation of Gilligan\\'s Island, complete with the star of the earlier show, Bob Denver.  Little House on the Prairie was set on the frontier in the time period of the Western, but was essentially a family drama. Kung Fu was in the tradition of the itinerant gunfighter Westerns, but the main character was a Shaolin monk, the son of an American father and a Chinese mother, who fought only with his formidable martial art skill. Bruce Lee had proposed a series with a similar concept, The Warrior, but studios rejected it;[8] it would eventually be produced over 40 years after Lee\\'s death. The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams was a family adventure show about a gentle mountain man with an uncanny connection to wildlife who helps others who visit his wilderness refuge. Dallas took the soap opera genre and put it into a Western setting, with established TV Western star Jim Davis as patriarch Jock Ewing.\\nThe 1990s saw the networks filming Western movies on their own. These include Louis L\\'Amour\\'s Conagher starring Sam Elliott and Katharine Ross, Tony Hillerman\\'s The Dark Wind, The Last Outlaw, The Jack Bull, The Cisco Kid, The Cherokee Kid, and the TV series Lonesome Dove.\\nZorro was remade with Duncan Regehr for The Family Channel filmed in Madrid, Spain.\\nDr. Quinn, Medicine Woman was an American Western/dramatic television series created by Beth Sullivan. It ran on CBS for six seasons, from January 1, 1993, to May 16, 1998, and won multiple Emmy awards.\\nWalker, Texas Ranger was a long-running Western/crime drama series, set in the modern era, in the United States, that starred and later was produced by Chuck Norris. It ran on CBS for nine seasons, from April 21, 1993, to May 19, 2001. For most of their time on air, Dr. Quinn and Walker aired on the same Saturday night lineup. Walker would receive a reboot in 2021, with a prequel, Walker: Independence, following in 2022. \\nIn the 1993–1994 season, the Fox network aired a science fiction Western called The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., which lasted for only 27 episodes. In the fall of 1995, the UPN network aired its own science fiction Western, Legend, which ended after 12 episodes.\\nWestern TV shows from the 2000s included the Zorro-inspired, syndicated Queen of Swords, starring Tessie Santiago and filmed in Almeria, Spain; Louis L\\'Amour\\'s Crossfire Trail starring Tom Selleck; Monte Walsh; and Hillerman\\'s Coyote Waits and A Thief of Time. DVDs offer a second life to TV series like Peacemakers, and HBO\\'s Deadwood. In 2002, a show called Firefly (created by Joss Whedon) mixed the Western genre with science fiction. Breaking Bad, a neo-Western about crystal methamphetamine cooks in Albuquerque, NM, debuted in 2008 on AMC.[10][11]\\nSeries with Western themes that debuted in the 2010s include Justified, about a Western-style vigilante U.S. Marshal based in modern rural Kentucky, which debuted in 2010 on FX; Hell on Wheels, about the construction of the First transcontinental railroad across the United States, which debuted in 2011 on AMC; and Longmire, about a modern-day Wyoming sheriff, which debuted in 2012 on A&E. The Mandalorian (2019) is a space Western set within the Star Wars franchise and universe, with its lead character, a Mandalorian, roaming the galactic frontier and borrowing character traits from Clint Eastwood.[12]\\nWith the growth of cable television and direct broadcast satellites, reruns of Westerns have become more common. Upon its launch in 1996, TV Land carried a block of Westerns on Sundays; the network still airs Bonanza and the color episodes of Gunsmoke to the present day, which make up several hours of their daytime schedule. Encore Westerns, part of the Encore slate of premium channels, airs blocks of Western series in the morning and in the afternoon, while the channel airs Western films the rest of the day. MeTV, a digital broadcast channel, includes Westerns in its regular schedule as well, as does sister network Heroes & Icons. The family oriented INSP and Grit, another digital broadcast channel, also carry Westerns on its daytime schedules. INSP, previously a televangelism network, had such success with its Westerns that it adopted a nearly all-Western format in 2022.[13] Several Westerns have episodes that have lapsed into the public domain in the United States, allowing networks and stations to carry them without cost.\\nYellowstone, a neo-Western that debuted in 2018, jumped in ratings over the course of its third and fourth seasons to become one of cable television\\'s most popular programs.[14][15] Yellowstone, in turn, inspired a traditionally-set Western prequel, 1883, in 2021, and another series, 1923, a year later, both of which were successes.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWestern fiction is a genre of literature set in the American Old West frontier and typically set from the late eighteenth to the late nineteenth century.[1] Well-known writers of Western fiction include Zane Grey from the early 20th century and Louis L\\'Amour from the mid-20th century.[2][3] The genre peaked around the early 1960s, largely due to the popularity of televised Westerns such as Bonanza. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside a few west American states, only carry a small number of Western fiction books.\\nThe predecessor of the Western in American literature emerged early with tales of the frontier. The most famous of the early 19th-century frontier novels were James Fenimore Cooper\\'s five novels comprising the Leatherstocking Tales. Cooper\\'s novels were largely set in what was at the time the American frontier: the Appalachian Mountains and areas west of there. As did his novel The Prairie (1824), most later westerns would typically take place west of the Mississippi River.[4]\\nThe notable writer Washington Irving was inspired by Cooper and wrote tales of the American frontier beginning with A Tour on the Prairies which related his recent travels on the frontier. In 1834, he was approached by fur magnate John Jacob Astor, who convinced him to write a history of his fur trading colony in Astoria, Oregon. Irving made quick work of Astor\\'s project, shipping the fawning biographical account Astoria in February 1836.\\nThe Western as a specialized genre got its start in the \"penny dreadfuls\" and later the \"dime novels\".[5] Published in June 1860, Malaeska; the Indian Wife of the White Hunter is considered the first dime novel.[6] These cheaply made books were hugely successful and capitalized on the many stories that were being told about the mountain men, outlaws, settlers, and lawmen who were taming the western frontier. Many of these novels were fictionalized stories based on actual people, such as Billy the Kid, Buffalo Bill, Wyatt Earp (who was still alive at the time), Wild Bill Hickok, and Jesse James.\\nBy 1900, the new medium of pulp magazines helped to relate these adventures to easterners. Meanwhile, non-American authors, like the German Karl May, picked up the genre, went to full novel length, and made it hugely popular and successful in continental Europe from about 1880 on, though they were generally dismissed as trivial by the literary critics of the day.[7] One of the most famous pulp works of the era was Johnston McCulley\\'s first Zorro novel, The Curse of Capistrano (1919).\\nPopularity grew with the publication of Owen Wister\\'s novel The Virginian (1902) and especially Zane Grey\\'s Riders of the Purple Sage (1912). The first Hopalong Cassidy stories by Clarence Mulford appeared in 1904, both as dime novels and in pulp magazines. When pulp magazines exploded in popularity in the 1920s, Western fiction greatly benefited (as did the author Max Brand, who excelled at the western short story). Pulp magazines that specialised in Westerns include Cowboy Stories, Ranch Romances, Star Western, West, and Western Story Magazine.[8] The simultaneous popularity of Western movies in the 1920s also helped the genre.\\nIn the 1940s several seminal Westerns were published, including The Ox-Bow Incident (1940) by Walter van Tilburg Clark, The Big Sky (1947) and The Way West (1949) by A.B. Guthrie Jr., and Shane (1949) by Jack Schaefer. Many other Western authors gained readership in the 1950s, such as Ray Hogan, Louis L\\'Amour, and Luke Short.\\nThe genre peaked around the early 1960s, largely due to the tremendous number of Westerns on television. The burnout of the American public on television Westerns in the late 1960s seemed to have an effect on the literature as well, and interest in Western literature began to wane.[citation needed] In 1968 Charles Portis published True Grit, which became the most successful work of the era.\\nWestern novels, films and pulps gave birth to Western comics, which were very popular, particularly from the late 1940s until c.\\u20091967, when the comics began to turn to reprints. This can particularly be seen at Marvel Comics, where Westerns began c.\\u20091948 and thrived until 1967, when one of their flagship titles, Kid Colt Outlaw (1949–1979), ceased to have new stories and entered the reprint phase. Other notable long-running Marvel Western comics included Rawhide Kid (1955–1957, 1960–1979) Two-Gun Kid (1948–1962), and Marvel Wild Western (1948–1957).\\nDC Comics published the long-running series All-Star Western (1951–1961) and Western Comics (1948–1961), and Charlton Comics published Billy the Kid (1957–1983) and Cheyenne Kid (1957–1973). Magazine Enterprises\\' Straight Arrow ran from 1950 to 1956, and Prize Comics\\' Prize Comics Western ran from 1948 to 1956.\\nFawcett Comics published a number of Western titles, including Hopalong Cassidy from 1948 to 1953. They also published comics starring actors known for their Western roles, including Tom Mix Western (1948–1953) and Gabby Hayes Western (1948–1953). Similarly, Dell Comics published Roy Rogers comics from 1948 to 1961, and Magazine Enterprises published Charles Starrett as the Durango Kid from 1949 to 1955.\\nThe Franco-Belgian comic-series Lucky Luke by Morris (cartoonist) and  René Goscinny is one of the most famous and estimated Western-comics in Europe.\\nThe popular Western comic strip Red Ryder was syndicated in hundreds of American newspapers from 1938 to 1964.\\nIn the 1970s, the work of Louis L\\'Amour began to catch hold of most western readers and he has dominated the western reader lists ever since.[citation needed] George G. Gilman also maintained a cult following for several years in the 1970s and 1980s.[citation needed] Larry McMurtry\\'s and Cormac McCarthy\\'s works remain notable. Specifically, McMurtry\\'s Lonesome Dove and McCarthy\\'s Blood Meridian (both published in 1985) are recognized as major masterpieces both within and beyond the genre. Elmer Kelton, mostly noted for his novels The Good Old Boys and The Time it Never Rained, was voted by the Western Writers of America as the \"Best Western Writer of All Time\". Early in the 1970s Indiana novelist Marilyn Durham wrote two popular Western novels, The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing and Dutch Uncle.\\nWestern readership as a whole began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s.[citation needed] A partial exception was an innovation,[citation needed] the so-called \"adult western\". As Robert J. Randisi puts it, \"it\\'s a western novel with sex in it. That\\'s right, the cowboy has sex with women. A new idea? Probably not, but heretofore this had not been seen in western novels (certainly not by Max Brand, Zane Grey, Owen Wister or Louis L\\'Amour). What these books actually showed was that men and women really did have sex in the old west. (Back when I started the series a rigidly traditional western writer of my acquaintance insisted to me that \"women did not have orgasms in the old west.\").\"[9]\\nReadership of western fiction reached a new low in the first decade of the twenty-first century, and most bookstores, outside a few western states, only carry a small number of Western fiction books. Nevertheless, several Western fiction series are published monthly, such as The Trailsman, Slocum, Longarm and The Gunsmith; these are all \"adult westerns\". Canadian author Guy Vanderhaeghe wrote a trilogy of Western novels: The Englishman\\'s Boy, The Last Crossing, and A Good Man. Other more recent Western authors include Ivan Doig and William Kittredge. The genre has seen the rumblings of a revival, and 2008 saw the publication of an all-Western short story magazine Great Western Fiction which was published by Dry River Publishing in Colorado. Nevertheless, the magazine was short-lived and folded after only two issues.[10] One of the most successful Western novels in recent times was The Sisters Brothers (2011) by Patrick deWitt.\\nWestern authors are represented by the Western Writers of America, who present the annual Spur Awards and Owen Wister Award for Lifetime Achievement. The organization was founded in 1953 to promote the literature of the American West. While the founding members were mostly western fiction writers, the organization began getting a number of other members from other backgrounds such as historians, regional history buffs, and writers from other genres.\\nWestern Fictioneers, founded in 2010, is a professional writers\\' group that encourages and promotes the traditional Westerns. It is the only professional writers\\' organization composed entirely of authors who have written Western fiction. Fans of the genre may join as patron members. The Western Fictioneers\\' annual Peacemakers competition awards prizes in many categories of Western writing.[11]\\n',\n",
       "  'Western American Art includes artistic work which depicts the subjects related to the Western American region, and was treated as impoverished, unwanted and unworthy art before the twentieth century, during which period it achieved respectability as a rewarding region for studying.[1] The term holds a characteristic of narration that is different from the Modern art which focuses on abstraction. For the narration, Western American art focuses on subject than style. Considering as a national art, the subjects are distinct from the European art, namely, there is no elements from other region like Europe.[2] Cowboys and Indians are two well-known subjects and they consist the important part of artistic work of Western American art, demonstrating the daily life and activities of cowboys and American Indian in western American.[3]\\nThe development of Western American art was affected by the social, political and also economic factors in American society. On the one hand, these factors helped it developed, like the era of U.S. westward expansion; on the other hand, the progress of western American art was also restrained by them, like the industrial development, which spread the modern lifestyle in the West.[4] Western American Art experienced both prosperous and unvalued period during the art history.\\nCowboys in America originally came from Spain in 1519. The Spanish established farm and stocked with cows and horses. Then, the native Indians were trained by the landowners to handle cows and horses for maintaining and developing the farms.[5] During the 1700s, cow farms had spread into both north and south part to Texas, New Mexico and as far south as Argentina, which stimulated the form of native cowboys.[6] During the era of U.S. westward expansion, cowboys played a remarkable role. They rounded up livestock that were transported by rail around the country for sale.[6]\\nIn 1865 when the Civil War ended, the need of beef increased significantly due to the large amount of army. Thus, the expanded need of meat encouraged the development of livestock industry, also directly stimulated the expansion of cowboys.[6]\\nCowboys in American then developed their own styles differ from the original Vaquero. Their special style of life and dressing is called western lifestyle. To protect them from burning sunlight, they typically wear large hats with wide brims; boots to help them ride horses and bandanas to prevent them from dust. In order to keep their legs unharmed from sharp cactus needles, some of them wear chaps outside the trousers. When they live in the farm, they usually share a bunkhouse with each other to prepare for concealed danger.[6]\\nBefore the twentieth century, Western American art was not considered as important as it is in current decades. The paintings connected with the western American were described as impoverished and marginal quality for serious study. Therefore, because of the desire to distinct from the Europe in both the cultural and political aspect, there were some writers who started to explore a national art that would stand for the New World than the Old.[7]\\nDuring the eighteenth century, the subjects of the paintings were mainly focused on the heroic landscapes and the artists aimed to achieve the accuracy of the scenario showed in the paintings.[8] The Moccasin Error which is a factual error of a painting called The Death of General Wolfe, demonstrates how the artists during that period treated the accuracy of paintings. For this painting, Henry Laurens pointed out that the Indian was shown without moccasins which was unrealistic depending on the fact that the Indian warriors would not join in a fight without their moccasins, which they regarded as an indispensable part of their fighting equipment. Benjamin West, who painted The Death of General Wolfe, admitted this error and fixed it by added a pair of moccasins at the left corner.[9]\\nIn nineteenth century, the western American was considered as a symbol of freedom and unknown, encouraging artists to give support to the movement in the 19th century.[10] After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, artists and explorers were inspired by the changes to enter the westward which provided a stage for the young to challenge their talent. The later enter of the mature artists helped to form the integrated picture of the westward expansion, shaping the view of democracy value of American.[11] Due to the expansion, the conflict and displacement of Indian showed up eventually. Hence, the artists who devote to recording the displaced life of Native Americans came to the stage of art history in western American. George Catlin, who gave up the law career, was an example of this. Catlin began drawing portraits of Indians in more than 50 tribes, also recording hunting scenes, tribal rituals and landscapes in his paintings. These paintings then became valued and historical resources because of the accuracy of details of the paintings.[12] From 1830s to 1850s, the paintings turned to concentrated on the concepts of Native Americans as noble savages. With the increasing of conflicts between white settlers and Indians around mid-century, the portrayal of American Indian tended to be negative, for example, the description of Indian changed from \"noble red men\" to hostile savages.[13] Thus, the major subject became that Indians would eventually lost and controlled under the white settlers during the late 1850s.\\nAs the twentieth century came, with the development in cities and industries, the western area of American had comprehensive changes.[14] The cowboys and buffalo had disappeared, the open range vanished as well. The modern lifestyle was introduced to this area. Therefore, the subjects brought up by artists of the period were to recall the \"Wild West\". The inspiration stimulated artists of the West to reply for the changes. Thomas Moran, the painter of western vistas, created the last panoramic canvas of the region, Shoshone Falls on the Snake River.[15] This painting expresses the will of protecting western natural resource, however, after Moran visited this fall, a project for irrigation ruined the river.[14] With the influence of industrial development, the artistic works in early 20th century inherit the feature of the old century.[16] Nevertheless, the arising of modernism and the Armory Show of 1913 promoted the following changes in the Western American Art.[17]\\nWith the election of president Warren G. Harding and ending of the Great Depression, the western American rapidly developed during the 1920s. Modernism started to spread but there were more traditional depictions showed up dominating throughout the West.[18] The art colonies in California and New Mexico provided artists a place to further explore the western American. Thus, artists depicted the West in increasing various ways. Maynard Dixon, American painter, changed to easel paintings of Indians and landscapes rendered in a nearly cubist/realist style from illustrations of the Old West.[19] Paintings focusing on nature and animal are another way in which artists demonstrate the wild West. Carl Rungius, who was a nature and animal plein-air painter, is a typical example for this, therefore, he continued recording the western wild life over decades for this career.[20] Sculptors also recorded the western American in their unique way, which through utilizing their views of the Old West to create the sculptures for animals, cowboys, indians, and frontiersmen. At the end of 1920s, the tendency toward portrayals of Indians and romanticised views of their customs declined, meanwhile, interest toward avantgarde ideas increased.[21] In 1930s, the stock market crash affected the Americans negatively and inevitably influenced the style of artists during that dark period.[22]\\nCharles Marion Russell, also known as \"Kid Russell\", was an American artist of the American Old West, who used to be a cowboy in ranch. His cowboy background gave him advantages in his art career that he was familiar with the cowboy life and qualified to record the western history in which he played a part.[23] Russell was unschooled and self-taught but he was recognised as distinguished personality in the area of Western Art.[24] He created more than 2000 paintings of cowboys, Indians and landscapes of the West. During his cowboy career, he was actually not treated as a qualified cowboy but a storyteller and artist who expressed himself through the art and literary poesy. Even after Russell achieved recognition and acclaim, he remained the old traditions of the Old West and was devoted to the West before the white civilisation was imposed upon it.[25]\\nRussell born in a big family and was the third of six children. He showed a deep interest toward the art since his childhood. According to his family, Russell had a native artistic talent. He spent an appreciable amount of time at drawing and modelling.[26] Under the influence of western expansion, the slogan \"Go West young man\" was widely spread in Missouri. Therefore, a tendency to go to the West gradually formed among the young people.[27] Living under this environment, Russell inevitably had a dream of adventure toward the Old West as well. At the age of sixteen, he went to Montana and worked as a cowboy.[28]\\nRussell\\'s artistic works covered a various subjects, containing the daily life in the West, historical events and the traditional activities of the cowboys. The harsh reality and drama on the drive through Montana supply a documentary artist with material for a lifetime of work. The roundup in Judith Basin during his cowboy experience provided the idea and subjects for the early artistic efforts of Russell, from which he gained fame as an artist. One of the first large oil canvases he attempted was \"The Judith Roundup\" which probably done in 1885.[29] During the journey through the rough Montana terrain with beef cattle, they passed where bands of disloyal Piegans and Crows had recently finished a grievous fight. The herd was stopped by the red warriors who asked them to pay the tradition toll for each head of cattle when they crossed the Crow reservation. One of his famous paintings is related to these incidents, which is known as \"The Toll Collectors\" painted thirty-one years later in 1913.[30]\\nRussell\\'s paintings are representative among the artistic works of western American art, because he represented the views of the indigenous people in American instead of the non-native citizens\\' views. He was famous as a precise documentary artist with an exquisite sense of the West.[31]\\nFrederic Sackrider Remington was an American painter, who is considered to be one of the most representative artists of Western subjects. His paintings are mostly concentrated on the subjects of western American and the cowboys, Indians at particular the end of 19th century. He was closely involved in some determinant moments at which the image of the Western American was focused.[32] Remington created over 3000 paintings demonstrating the West subjects in the less than 30 years of his artistic life. Because of the industrial development, the modern lifestyle and railroad started spreading to the West. To save the traditional lifestyle in the West, he devoted to the changes of center of interest that turned to the drama and conflict which considered as the essential part of the life of western American.[33] His paintings mainly focus on the hard riding and hard fighting, especially at moment that the action present the maximum impact. It shows a tendency toward the narrativization of painting, recording the stories and reportage of the West.[34] Remington maintained a sense of tension and drama in his artistic works to show the wild and natural features of the West.\\nRemington was in a military school when he was young, where he took his first painting lesson. He then attended the art school at Yale University but he quit after his father died. At nineteen, he had his first trip to  Montana and then started his art career in the West.[35] He was recognised as one of the most successful Western illustrator during the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. He showed a talent in manage complex compositions and his artistic works were commented as modern and out-standing by some critics on which his style was mostly naturalistic. According to his paintings, he seemed to focus on the animals and people of the West instead of the landscape.[36] Although Remington had a high status, there were some critics pointed out that he was weak and unconfident at the color which limited the development of his artistic career.[37]\\n',\n",
       "  'A dime Western is a modern term for Western-themed dime novels, which spanned the era of the 1860s–1900s. Most would hardly be recognizable as a modern western, having more in common with James Fennimore Cooper\\'s Leatherstocking saga, but many of the standard elements originated here: a cool detached hero, a frontiersman (later a cowboy), a fragile heroine in danger of the despicable outlaw, savage Indians, violence and gunplay, and the final outcome where Truth and Light wins over all. Often real characters — such as Buffalo Bill or the famous Kit Carson — were fictionalized, as were the exploits of notorious outlaws such as Billy the Kid and Jesse James. Buffalo Bill\\'s literary incarnation provides the transition from the frontier tales to the cowboy story, as he straddles both of the genres.\\nThere were several different formats. From 1860 to roughly 1880, the stories appeared in small pamphlets, generally about 100 pages each, and sold for ten to fifteen cents. These books were issued at irregular intervals, and they were kept in print for years, as well as being reprinted under different titles. Later, the weekly magazine format came to predominate. These libraries were 32 pages, and sold for a nickel or a dime. Both formats were printed on cheap acidic paper, and relatively few have survived the years, despite circulation measured in the tens of millions.\\nIn 1919, Street & Smith canceled the last of their five-cent weeklies (New Buffalo Bill Weekly) and replaced it with the pulp Western Story Magazine, which brought the western into its modern form. The genre continued to evolve as new media came along, and mass market paperbacks and comic books maintained the western story\\'s popularity well into the late twentieth century. Its popularity has waned in the 21st century.\\nThe first profitable mass literature in America was the dime novel, which emerged in 1860. The dime novel focused on the West because of America’s increasing fascination and curiosity with expansion, Native Americans, and pioneers. This curiosity, combined with new technologies in publishing and distribution, made the western dime novel increasingly popular reading material until 1900.[1] Dime novels were written on pulp paper and featured black and white and/or color pictures.[2] Some of the most popular dime novelists between 1860 and 1900 were Ned Buntline, Edward Ellis, Prentiss Ingraham, and Edward Wheeler.[3] Dime novelists began writing as part of a greater push for profits and mass production. The novelists had a low level of autonomy in publishing houses and felt an urgent pressure to publish fast.[4] The dime novel was introduced by Irwin and Erastus Beadle, and was a cheaper form of reading than the previous fifteen- or twenty-cent readings seen in the 1830s and 1840s.[5] From 1860-1898, the Beadles operated the first dime novel publishing house. The first successful Beadle dime novels published were Seth Jones and The Captives of the Frontier.[6] Beadle dime novels focused on adventures in the Wild West, and targeted their novels successfully toward young boys. While young boys were statistically the largest demographic of dime novel western readers, the stories reached a nationwide audience.[7]\\nDuring the 1830s America was approaching 20 million people, most of whom were literate. Western dime novels provided a cheap, tangible form of literature that the common person could understand and enjoy.[8] The first Beadles-Adams dime novel, Malaeska: The Indian Wife of the White Hunter, was based on white hunters and native \"savages\". This dime novel sold 65,000 copies in just a few months.[9] A dime novel was intended to be read for pleasure. In the later half of the nineteenth century, men and women worked tirelessly caring for children and livestock or working in industry. Dime novel western readers read to escape daily urban life in exchange for some Wild West action and adventure. Dime novels provided colorful scenes of cowboys, Indians, horses, and gunpowder and were originally intended for middle class audiences, but upper and lower classes alike purchased and read the stories. Bootblacks, scholars, and businessmen found excitement in western fiction.[10]\\nAfter the American Civil War there was a growing fear of American men becoming overly feminine from industry and shifting away from agriculture. Literary scholars have theorized that reading western dime novels was a way to rekindle the manly spirit of the Frontier. By the late nineteenth century—the heyday of dime novel publication—the western frontier was coming to a close as white settlers blanketed the region. Dime novels played an initial role in mythologizing the West. Relatively few dime novels have survived to the present, and the ones that do are often difficult to access in private collections. For decades historians and scholars dismissed dime novels as a valid source of research for the American West because of their fictional plots and cartoony characters. But since the 1960s, cultural historians have mined them for material on popular representations of the West and the mythology of the frontier.[11]\\nScholars who have studied western dime novels argue that they portray the West as a utopia of cattle ranching, mountain men, blazing sun, and exciting pioneer life.[12] When action is taking place in a dime novel, the plot is typically set among a western backdrop of snow-covered mountains, expansive deserts, and perhaps a river. The western frontier in dime novels is often depicted by a lone cabin occupied by a few settlers and not much else. The frontier appears as a dangerous place of Indian raids, cattle roundups, and wilderness adventures.[13]\\nScholars of dime novels have described the western hero as a man who is above reproach from laws or familial duties and lives freely on the frontier.[14] Dime novels and other works of western fiction personify heroes in two ways. One hero has a rough and tumble attitude and shoots anything with legs. He is unaware of the balance of nature and lives without restraint. The second version of a western hero appreciates nature as God’s great work and rescues women in distress. There is a difference between the two heroes, which was intended by publishers to appeal to wider audiences. Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone are two examples of opposite heroes. Davy Crockett, also known as the \"King of the Wild Frontier\" and depicted wearing a coonskin cap, was popularized for his efforts in the Texas Revolution. He died during the Battle of the Alamo. Daniel Boone was a frontier pioneer who participated in the fur trade. Born in 1734, he is one of the earliest pioneers and American western hero.\\n“Indian hating” is a common trait among heroes on the frontier, usually because they have lost family members to savage raids. Many heroes seek revenge on native tribes for crimes in white settlements. Violent passages in dime novels involving shoot-outs and scalping are common among these heroes.[15] By the 1870s, however, the hero shifted towards a more socially acceptable demeanor. He becomes refined, self-reliant, and lives harmoniously with the wilderness, rather than ransacking the West for all it’s worth.[16] In contrast with the socially accepted moral hero of 1870, the infamous outlaw first appeared in an 1877 dime novel. The outlaw was designed by dime novelists to have a split personality, and serve as a protagonist and antagonist. The outlaw both commits crimes and saves women in distress. Depending on the dime novel’s premise, the outlaw could have been a hero or antagonist. It was up to the reader to decide whether the outlaw was a hero or not. In either case, the outlaw lived beyond any legal system in place in the west.[17]\\nPopular dime novels that still receive scholarly attention today are Charles Averill\\'s Kit Carson stories, about an Indian slayer, mountain man, and trailblazer, and Buffalo Bill\\'s stories of buffalo hunting and riding on the Pony Express.\\nDime novels were slowly replaced by pulp magazines at the turn of the century, and almost completely vanished by 1920. Pulp magazines were larger in size, had full-page color pictures, and served as an advertisement for growing industry.[18] A secondary reason for the demise of the dime western was probably due to the rise of western films in the first half of the 20th century.\\nBibliography\\n',\n",
       "  'Western comics is a comics genre usually depicting the American Old West frontier (usually anywhere west of the Mississippi River) and typically set during the late nineteenth century. The term is generally associated with an American comic books genre published from the late 1940s through the 1950s (though the genre had continuing popularity in Europe, and persists in limited form in American comics today). Western comics of the period typically featured dramatic scripts about cowboys, gunfighters, lawmen, bounty hunters, outlaws, and Native Americans. Accompanying artwork depicted a rural America populated with such iconic images as guns, cowboy hats, vests, horses, saloons, ranches, and deserts, contemporaneous with the setting.\\nWestern novels, films, and pulp magazines were extremely popular in the United States from the late 1930s to the 1960s.\\nWestern comics first appeared in syndicated newspaper strips in the late 1920s. Harry O\\'Neill\\'s Young Buffalo Bill (later changed to Buckaroo Bill and then, finally, Broncho Bill), distributed by United Feature Syndicate beginning in 1927, , and was a pioneering example of the form.[1] Starting in the 1930s, Red Ryder, Little Joe, and King of the Royal Mounted were syndicated in hundreds of newspapers across the United States. Garrett Price\\'s White Boy (later changed to Skull Valley) was another syndicated strip from the 1930s.[2]\\nThe first Western stories to appear in the comics were in the mid-1930s: National Allied\\'s New Fun Comics #1 (Feb. 1935) ran the modern-West feature \"Jack Woods\" and the Old West feature \"Buckskin Jim\"; Centaur Publications\\' The Comics Magazine #1 (May 1936) ran the feature \"Captain Bill of the Rangers\"; and David McKay Publications\\'s Feature Book #1 (May 1937) and a single issue of King Comics (also 1937) featured King of the Royal Mounted reprints before Dell took over licensing of the character. Dell Comics\\' The Funnies published a run of short adaptations of B-movie Westerns starting in vol. 2, issue #20 (May 1938). Whitman Comics\\' Crackajack Funnies ran regular Western features (including Tom Mix stories) beginning with issue #1 in June 1938.\\nThe first stand-alone Western comics titles were published by Centaur Publications. Star Ranger and Western Picture Stories[3] both debuted from the publisher in late 1936, cover-dated Feb. 1937. Star Ranger ran for 12 issues, becoming Cowboy Comics for a couple of issues, and then becoming Star Ranger Funnies. The series ended in October 1939. Western Picture Stories ran four issues in 1937. Dell Comics published Western Action Thrillers #1 shortly thereafter (cover-date Apr. 1937), and began publishing Red Ryder Comics,[4] initially reprinting the long-running comic strip, in 1941.\\nWestern comics became popular in the years immediately following World War II, when superheroes went out of style. Adult  readership had grown during the war years, and returning servicemen wanted subjects other than superheroes in their books. The popularity of the Western genre in comic strips and other media gave birth to Western comics, many of which began being published around 1948.[5][4]\\nMost of the larger publishers of the period jumped headfirst into the Western arena during this period, particularly Marvel Comics and its forerunners Timely Comics and Atlas Comics. Kid Colt Outlaw debuted in 1948, running until 1979 (though it was primarily a reprint title after 1967). The company soon established itself as the most prolific publisher of Western comics[6] with other notable long-running titles, including Rawhide Kid, Two-Gun Kid, and Wild Western.\\nThe six-issue 1950 Harvey Comics series Boys\\' Ranch, by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, was a seminal example of the Western comics genre. DC Comics published the long-running series All-Star Western and Western Comics. Charlton Comics published Billy the Kid, Cheyenne Kid, Outlaws of the West, Texas Rangers in Action, and the unusual title Black Fury, about a horse that roamed the West righting wrongs. Both Dell Comics and Fawcett Comics published a number of Western titles, including The Lone Ranger (Dell) and Hopalong Cassidy (Fawcett, later continued by DC after Fawcett folded in 1953). Many issues of Dell\\'s Four Color featured Western stories during the 1950s. Avon Comics published a number of Western comics, the most notable titles being based on historical figures like Jesse James and Wild Bill Hickok. Youthful published the Western titles Gunsmoke, Indian Fighter, and Redskin (later known as Famous Western Badmen). And Toby Press published its own Billy the Kid Adventure Magazine.\\nThe first Western hero to have his adventures published in the comics was the Masked Raider, published by Timely Comics beginning in 1939.\\nTimely/Atlas/Marvel favored Western characters with the word \"Kid\" in their name, including the Apache Kid, Kid Colt, the Outlaw Kid, the Rawhide Kid, the Ringo Kid, the Two-Gun Kid, and the Western Kid—as well as the more obscure heroes the Prairie Kid, the Arizona Kid, and the Texas Kid. Other companies followed suit, with DC\\'s Stuff the Chinatown Kid and the Wyoming Kid; Charlton Comics\\' Billy the Kid and the Cheyenne Kid; and Dell\\'s the Cisco Kid.\\nBlack Rider and Phantom Rider were two other Marvel company characters from the genre\\'s peak. Other early DC Comics Western characters included Johnny Thunder, Nighthawk, Pow Wow Smith, Tomahawk, the Trigger Twins, and Vigilante. Dell Comics featured the Lone Ranger, and Dell\\'s Lobo (debuting in 1965) was the medium\\'s first African-American character to headline his own series.\\nThe years 1946–1949 saw an explosion of titles \"starring\" Western film actors and cowboy singers. Almost every star, major or minor, had their own title at some point; and almost every publisher got in on the action: Fawcett published Allan Lane, Monte Hale, Gabby Hayes, Lash LaRue, Tex Ritter, and Tom Mix comics; Dell published Gene Autry, Rex Allen, Roy Rogers, and Wild Bill Elliott comics; Magazine Enterprises published Charles Starrett and Tim Holt comics; Toby Press published a John Wayne title; and DC produced short-lived Dale Evans and Jimmy Wakely titles. (Dale Evans and Reno Browne were the only two Western actresses to have comics based on their characters.)[citation needed] Most of the cowboy actor titles featured photo covers of the stars; most series had been canceled by 1957.\\nSince Westerns were such a popular genre in the 1950s, many of the period\\'s notable creators spent at least some time doing Western comics.\\nWriter Paul S. Newman and artist Tom Gill had an 11-year stretch on Dell\\'s The Lone Ranger, a 107-issue run that marks one of the longest of any writer/artist team on a comic-book series. Larry Lieber spent nine years as writer-artist of Marvel\\'s Rawhide Kid. France Herron and Fred Ray were the long-time writer and artist of DC\\'s Tomahawk. Gaylord DuBois excelled in writing Western comics featuring realistic animals: he wrote the entire run of The Lone Ranger\\'s Famous Horse Hi-Yo Silver, the entire run of National Velvet under both the Dell and Gold Key imprints, and many other animal stories for a number of publishers.\\nCarl Pfeufer was the longtime artist of Fawcett\\'s Tom Mix comics. Artist Fred Guardineer had a long run on Magazine Enterprises\\' The Durango Kid. Pete Tumlinson illustrated most of Kid Colt\\'s early stories. Later, Tumlinson drew Western stories for Atlas Comics\\' Outlaw Fighters, Two-Gun Western, and Wild Western. Russ Heath drew a corral-full of Western stories for such Marvel titles as Wild Western, All Western Winners, Arizona Kid, Black Rider, Western Outlaws, and Reno Browne, Hollywood\\'s Greatest Cowgirl. Vic Carrabotta worked on such Marvel Westerns as Apache Kid, Kid Colt: Outlaw, The Outlaw Kid, and Western Outlaws. Artist John Severin was known for his 1950s Western comics art for Atlas. Artist Mike Sekowsky drew such characters as the Apache Kid, the Black Rider, and Kid Colt for Atlas; he later freelanced for other companies, drawing the TV-series spin-offs Gunsmoke and Buffalo Bill, Jr. for Dell Comics.\\nArtist Rocke Mastroserio specialized in Western stories for such Charlton Comics series as Billy the Kid, Black Fury, Jim Bowie, Rocky Lane\\'s Black Jack, Sheriff of Tombstone, Six-Gun Heroes, Texas Rangers in Action, and Wyatt Earp, Frontier Marshal. Pat Boyette worked on such Charlton Western series as Billy the Kid, Cheyenne Kid, and Outlaws of the West.\\nThe Western genre in general peaked around 1960, largely due to the tremendous number of Westerns on American television.[citation needed] Increasingly, the genre reflected a Romantic view of the American West—and American history in general. As the country grappled with the cultural issues of the 1960s and the Vietnam War, the genre seemed increasingly out of touch.[citation needed]\\nAs the American public\\'s interest in the genre waned, Western literature—including comics—began to lose its appeal as well. At the same time, the comics industry was shifting back to superheroes (entering its \"Silver Age\") and away from some of the other genres which had flourished during the 1950s. In fact, of the original Western comics series begun in the late 1940s and early 1950s, only a handful of titles survived the 1950s. Charlton\\'s low production costs enabled it to continue producing a number of Western titles, but otherwise Dell\\'s The Lone Ranger, and Marvel\\'s Gunsmoke Western, Kid Colt Outlaw, and Rawhide Kid were the only Western titles to make it through the 1960s.\\nGary Friedrich, Mike Esposito, and Ogden Whitney are three of the few notable Western comics creators from the 1960s.\\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s saw the rise of revisionist Western film. Elements include a darker, more cynical tone, with focus on the lawlessness of the time period, favoring realism over romanticism, and an interest in greater historical authenticity. Anti-heroes were common, as were stronger roles for women and more-sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans and Mexicans. The films were often critical of big business, the American government, and masculine figures (including the military and their policies).\\nReflecting the trend, in 1968 DC debuted the new character Bat Lash, who starred in a short-lived series. They also revived the All-Star Western title, starting volume two of the series in 1970. In 1972, All-Star Western changed its name to Weird Western Tales, with many stories featuring the newly created Western antihero Jonah Hex (debuting in 1975 in his own title). Weird Western Tales (sister title of Weird War Tales) defined a new multi-genre form: \"Weird West,\" a combination of the Western with another literary genre, usually horror, occult, or fantasy. Other Western characters DC created during this period include the heroes Scalphunter and El Diablo, and the villains El Papagayo, Terra-Man, and Quentin Turnbull.\\nMarvel also attempted to capitalize on the renewed interest in the Western with two mostly reprint titles, The Mighty Marvel Western (1968–1976) and Western Gunfighters vol. 2 (1970–1975).\\nThe short-lived publisher Skywald Publications attempted a line of Western titles in the early 1970s, but nothing came of it.\\nWeird Western Tales survived until 1980, and Jonah Hex until 1985. By then no major publishers were producing Western titles, though iconic characters from the DC and Marvel canons would occasionally make cameo appearances in other books.\\nThe DC Comics imprint Vertigo reintroduced the Western genre in 1995 with Preacher, set in a contemporary version of the West. In the 1990s and 2000s, the Western comic leaned toward the Weird West subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period, from Jonah Hex to Loveless. Series like Desperadoes, High Moon, and Scalped demonstrate the genre\\'s continuing appeal. Creators like Joe R. Lansdale, Michael Fleisher, and Tony DeZuniga were notable contributors to Western comics from this period.\\nIn addition, publishers like America\\'s Comics Group and AC Comics have reprinted a number of Western comics from the genre\\'s \"Golden Age.\"\\nThe Goodbye Family, about a family of Weird West undertakers, started in 2015 and continues in both online and print formats.\\nThe Western genre\\'s overall popularity in Europe spawned a Western comics trend, particularly in Italy, France, Belgium, and England. Many European countries published reprints of American-made Western comics (translated into the respective country\\'s native language). The Italian publishers Sergio Bonelli Editore and Editorial Novaro led the field—Editorial Novaro\\'s Gene Autry title ran 424 issues from 1954 to 1984. The Norwegian publisher Se-Bladene and the British publisher L. Miller & Son were also particularly known for their Western comics reprint titles. Se-Bladene\\'s Texas ran 606 issues between 1954 and 1975. The Australian publishers Ayers & James, Cleland, Federal Publishing, Gredown, and Horwitz Publications all published reprints of American Western comics during the 1950s and 1960s.\\nThe most popular and long-running Italian-produced Western comic is Gian Luigi Bonelli and Aurelio Galleppini\\'s Tex (starring Tex Willer), first published in 1948.

       "  'Wild West shows were traveling vaudeville performances in the United States and Europe that existed around 1870–1920. The shows began as theatrical stage productions and evolved into open-air shows that depicted romanticized stereotypes of cowboys, Plains Indians, army scouts, outlaws, and wild animals that existed in the American West. While some of the storylines and characters were based on historical events, others were fictional or sensationalized.[1]\\nAmerican Indians in particular were portrayed in a sensationalistic and exploitative manner.[1] The shows introduced many western performers and personalities, and romanticized the American frontier, to a wide audience.\\nIn the 19th century, following the American Civil War, stories and inexpensive dime novels depicting the American West and frontier life were becoming common. In 1869, author Ned Buntline wrote a novel about the buffalo hunter, U.S. Army scout, and guide William F. Buffalo Bill Cody called Buffalo Bill, the King of Border Men after the two met on a train from California to Nebraska. In December 1872, Buntline\\'s novel turned into a theatrical production when The Scouts of the Prairie debuted in Chicago. The show featured Buntline, Cody, Texas Jack Omohundro, and the Italian-born ballerina Giuseppina Morlacchi and toured the American theater circuit for two years.[2]\\nBuntline left the show and in 1874 Cody founded the Buffalo Bill Combination, in which he performed for part of the year while scouting on the prairies the rest of the year.[3]\\nWild Bill Hickok joined the group to headline in a new play called Scouts of the Plains. Hickok did not enjoy acting and was released from the group after one show when he shot out a spotlight that focused on him.[4]\\nTexas Jack parted ways with Cody in 1877 and formed his own acting troupe in St. Louis, known as the \\'Texas Jack Combination\\', and in May of that year he debuted Texas Jack in the Black Hills.[5] \\nOther plays the combination performed included The Trapper\\'s Daughter and Life on the Border.\\nIn 1883, Cody founded Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West, an outdoor attraction that toured annually.[6] The new show contained a lot of action including wild animals, trick performances, and theatrical reenactments.  All sorts of characters from the frontier were incorporated into the show\\'s program. Shooting exhibitions were also in the lineup with extensive shooting displays and trick shots. Rodeo events, involving rough and dangerous activities performed by cowboys with different animals, also featured. It was the first and prototypical Wild West show, lasting until 1915, and featured theatrical reenactments of battle scenes, characteristic western scenes, and even hunts.[7]\\nIn 1883, Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West was founded in Omaha, Nebraska when Buffalo Bill Cody turned his real life adventure into the first outdoor western show.[8] \\nThe show\\'s publicist Arizona John Burke employed innovative techniques at the time, such as celebrity endorsements, press kits, publicity stunts, op-ed articles, billboards and product licensing, that contributed to the success and popularity of the show.[9]\\nBuffalo Bill\\'s Wild West toured Europe eight times, the first four tours between 1887 and 1892, and the last four from 1902 to 1906.[10] The first tour was in 1887 as part of the American Exhibition, which coincided with the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.[11] The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, requested a private preview of the Wild West performance; he was impressed enough to arrange a command performance for Queen Victoria. The Queen enjoyed the show and meeting the performers, setting the stage for another command performance on June 20, 1887, for her Jubilee guests. Royalty from all over Europe attended, including the future Kaiser Wilhelm II and the future King George V.[12] Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West closed its successful London run in October 1887 after more than 300 performances, with more than 2.5 million tickets sold.[13]\\nThe tour made stops in Birmingham and Manchester before returning to the United States in May 1888 for a short summer tour. A return tour was made in 1891-92,[14] including Cardiff, Wales and Glasgow, Scotland, in the itinerary.\\nIn 1893, Cody changed the title to Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World and the show performed at the Chicago World\\'s Fair to a crowd of 18,000.  This performance was a huge contributor to the show\\'s popularity. The show never again did as well as it did that year. That same year at the Fair, Frederick Turner, a young Wisconsin scholar, gave a speech that pronounced the first stage of American history over.  \"The frontier has gone\", he declared.[15]\\nBuffalo Bill\\'s Wild West returned to Europe in December 1902 with a fourteen-week run in London, capped by a visit from King Edward VII and the future King George V. The Wild West traveled throughout Great Britain in a tour in 1902 and 1903 and a tour in 1904, performing in nearly every city large enough to support it.[16] The 1905 tour began in April with a two-month run in Paris, after which the show traveled around France, performing mostly one-night stands, concluding in December. The final tour, in 1906, began in France on March 4 and quickly moved to Italy for two months. The show then traveled east, performing in Austria, the Balkans, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine, before returning west to tour in Poland, Bohemia (later Czech Republic), Germany, and Belgium.[17]\\nBy 1894 the harsh economy made it hard to afford tickets. It did not help that the show was routed to go through the South in a year when the cotton was flooded and there was a general depression in the area. Buffalo Bill lost a lot of money and was on the brink of a financial disaster. Soon after, and in an attempt of recovery of monetary balance, Buffalo Bill signed a contract in which he was tricked by Bonfil and Temmen into selling them the show and demoting himself to a mere employee and attraction of the Sells-Floto Circus. From this point, the show began to destroy itself.  Finally, in 1913 the show was declared bankrupt.[18]\\nThe shows consisted of reenactments of history combined with displays of showmanship, sharpshooting, hunts, racing, or rodeo style events. Each show was 3–4 hours long and attracted crowds of thousands of people daily. The show began with a parade on horseback. The parade was a major ordeal, an affair that involved huge public crowds and many performers, including the Congress of Rough Riders.\\nEvents included acts known as Bison Hunt, Train Robbery, Indian War Battle Reenactment, and the usual grand finale of the show, Attack on the Burning Cabin, in which Indians attacked a settler\\'s cabin and were repulsed by Buffalo Bill, cowboys, and Mexicans. Also included were semi-historical scenes such as a settler perspective of the Battle of the Little Bighorn or the charge on San Juan Hill. The reenactment of the Battle of Little Bighorn also known as \"Custer\\'s Last Stand\" featured Buck Taylor starring as General George Armstrong Custer. In this battle, Custer and all men under his direct command were killed. After Custer is dead, Buffalo Bill rides in, the hero, but he is too late. He avenges Custer by killing and scalping Yellow Hair (also called Yellowhand) which he called the \"first scalp for Custer\".[19]\\nShooting competitions and displays of marksmanship were commonly a part of the program. Great feats of skill were shown off using rifles, shotguns, and revolvers. Most people in the show were good marksmen but many were experts.\\nAnimals also did their share in the show through rodeo entertainment. In rodeo events, cowboys like Lee Martin would try to rope and ride broncos. Broncos are unbroken horses that tend to throw or buck their riders. Other wild animals they would attempt to ride or deal with were mules, buffalo, Texas steers, elk, deer, bears, and moose. The show also demonstrated hunts which were staged as they would have been on the frontier, and were accompanied by one of the few remaining buffalo herds in the world.[20]\\nRaces were another form of entertainment employed in the Wild West show. Many different races were held, including those between cowboys, Mexicans, and Indians,[citation needed] a 100 yd foot race between Indian and Indian pony,[citation needed] a race between Sioux boys on bareback Indian ponies,[citation needed] races between Mexican thoroughbreds, and even a race between Lady Riders.\\nOver time, various Wild West shows were developed. They included Bee Ho Gray\\'s Wild West,\\nTexas Jack\\'s Wild West, Pawnee Bill\\'s Wild West, Jones Bros.\\' Buffalo Ranch Wild West, Cummin\\'s Indian Congress and Wild West Show[21] and \"Buckskin Joe\" Hoyt.[22]\\nThe 101 Ranch Wild West Show featuring African Americans such as Bill Pickett, the famous bulldogger and his brother Voter Hall who billed as a \"Feejee Indian from Africa\".[23]\\nThe Esquivel Brothers from San Antonio.[23]\\nWild West shows contained as many as 1,200 performers at one time (cowboys, scouts, Indians, military, Mexicans, and men from other heritages) and many animals, including buffalo and Texas Longhorns. Some of the recognizably famous men who took part in the show were Will Rogers, Tom Mix, Pawnee Bill, James Lawson, Bill Pickett, Jess Willard, Mexican Joe, Capt. Adam Bogardus, Buck Taylor, Harry Henry Brennan (father of modern bronc riding),[24] Grover C. Brennan, Ralph and Nan Lohse, Antonio Esquibel, Capt. Waterman and his Trained Buffalo, and Johnny Baker. Johnny Baker was nicknamed the \"Cowboy Kid\" and considered to be Annie Oakley\\'s boy counterpart. \\nSome notable cowboys who participated in the events were Buck Taylor (dubbed \"The First Cowboy King\"), Bronco Bill, James Lawson (\"The Roper\"), Bill Bullock, Tim Clayton, Coyote Bill, sharpshooter James Spleen (\"Kit Carson Jr\"), frontiersman John Baker Omohundro (\"Texas Jack\"), and Bridle Bill.\\nWomen were also a large part of Wild West shows and attracted many spectators. One such performer was Annie Oakley, who first gained recognition as a sharpshooter when she defeated Frank Butler, a pro marksman at age 15, in a shooting exhibition. She became an attraction of Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West show for 16 years. Annie was billed in the show as \"Miss Annie Oakley, the Peerless Lady Wing-Shot\".[25]\\nCalamity Jane was another distinguished woman performer. Calamity Jane was a notorious frontierswoman who was the subject of many wild stories—many of which she made up herself. She was a skilled horsewoman and expert rifle and revolver handler in the show. Calamity Jane appeared in Wild West shows until 1902 when she was reportedly fired for drinking and fighting.[26]\\nOther notable females in the business were Tillie Baldwin, May Lillie, Lucille Mulhall, Lillian Smith, Bessie and Della Ferrel, Luella-Forepaugh Fish,[27] the Kemp Sisters, and Texas Rose as an announcer.[28]\\n\"Show Indians\" - actors largely from the Plains Nations, such as the Lakota people - were also a part of Wild West shows.[1] They were hired to participate in staged \"Indian Races\" and what were alleged to be historic battles, and often appeared in attack scenes attacking whites in which they were encouraged to portray \"savagery and wildness\".[1] The shows \"generally presented Native people as exotic savages, prone to bizarre rites and cruel violence.\"[1] The Native women were dressed in \"exploitative\", non-traditional clothing such as men\\'s headdresses and breastplates, combined with immodest attire like leather shorts, none of which would have ever been worn in reality.[1] They also performed what was billed as \"the Sioux Ghost Dance\".[29]\\nChief Sitting Bull joined Cody\\'s Wild West show for a short time and was a star attraction alongside Annie Oakley. During his time at the show, Sitting Bull was introduced to President Grover Cleveland, which he thought proved his importance as chief. He was friends with Buffalo Bill and highly valued the horse that was given to him when he left the show.\\n[30]\\nRed Eagle (1870–1949) immersed himself in a three-year training period at Cody\\'s base in North Platte, Nebraska. During this time, he honed his skills in steer roping, lariat tricks, and the art of maintaining a firm grip on \"anything that had four legs.\" His debut in the spotlight occurred at the age of thirteen, portraying a Pony Express rider. Merely a year later, the Show set off on a tour across Europe. Over the span of several years, Red Eagle became an integral member of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show, captivating audiences throughout his journey.[31][32][33]\\nOther familiar Native Americans names who performed in the show were Red Cloud,[34] Chief Joseph,[35] Geronimo[citation needed], and the Modoc War scout Donald McKay.\\nWestern shows generated interest for Western entertainment. This is still evidenced in western films, modern rodeos, and circuses.[20] Western films in the first half of the 20th century filled the gap left behind by Wild West shows.[citation needed] The first real western, The Great Train Robbery, was made in 1903, and thousands followed after. In the 1960s Spaghetti Westerns, a genre of movies about the American Old West made in Europe, were common.\\nContemporary rodeos continue to be held, employing the same events and skills as cowboys did in Wild West shows. Wild Westers still perform in movies, pow-wows, pageants and rodeos. There remains an interest in Native peoples through much of the United States and Europe, including an interest in the pow-wow culture of Native people. Some events are open to outside tourists who are able to observe traditional Native American skills: horse culture, ceremonial dancing, food, art, music and crafts, while other pow-wows are closed events for members of the Native community only.\\nThere are several ongoing national projects that celebrate Wild Westers and Wild Westing.  The National Museum of American History\\'s Photographic History Collection at the Smithsonian Institution preserves and displays Gertrude Käsebier\\'s photographs, as well as many others by photographers who captured the displays of Wild Westing.\\nThe Carlisle Indian School Resource Center of the Cumberland County Historical Society in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, houses an extensive collection of archival materials and photographs from the Carlisle Indian School. In 2000, the Cumberland County 250th Anniversary Committee worked with Native Americans from numerous tribes and non-natives to organize a pow-wow on Memorial Day to commemorate the Carlisle Indian School, the students and their stories.[36]\\nBibliography\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAcid Western is a subgenre of the Western film that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s that combines the metaphorical ambitions of critically acclaimed Westerns, such as Shane and The Searchers, with the excesses of the Spaghetti Westerns and the outlook of the counterculture of the 1960s, as well as the increase in illicit drug taking of, for example, cannabis and LSD. Acid Westerns subvert many of the conventions of earlier Westerns to \"conjure up a crazed version of autodestructive white America at its most solipsistic, hankering after its own lost origins\".[1]\\nFilm critic Pauline Kael coined the term \"acid Western\" in a review of Alejandro Jodorowsky\\'s film El Topo, published in the November 1971 issue of The New Yorker.[2]\\nJonathan Rosenbaum expanded upon the idea in his June 1996 review of Jim Jarmusch\\'s film Dead Man, a subsequent interview with Jarmusch for Cineaste,[3] and later in the book Dead Man, from BFI Modern Classics. In the book, Rosenbaum illuminates several aspects of this re-revisionist Western: from Neil Young\\'s haunting score, to the role of tobacco, to Johnny Depp\\'s performance, to the film\\'s place in the acid Western genre. In the chapter \"On the Acid Western\", Rosenbaum addresses not only the hallucinogenic quality of the film\\'s pace and its representation of reality, but also argues that the film inherits an artistic and political sensibility derived from the 1960s counterculture which has sought to critique and replace capitalism with alternative models of exchange.[4]\\nIn the traditional Western, the journey west is seen as a road to liberation and improvement, but in the acid Western, it is the reverse, a journey towards death.\\nRosenbaum used the term \"acid Western\" to describe a \"cherished counterculture dream\" from the 1960s and 1970s \"associated with people like Monte Hellman, Dennis Hopper, Jim McBride, and Rudy Wurlitzer, as well as movies like Greaser\\'s Palace. Alex Cox tapped into something similar in the 1980s with Walker.\"[3]\\nMonte Hellman\\'s cult film The Shooting (1966) could be considered the first acid Western.[5] The film stars Will Hutchins, Warren Oates, and Jack Nicholson and was anonymously financed by Roger Corman. The Shooting subverts the usual priorities of the Western to capture a sense of dread and uncertainty that characterized the counterculture of the late 1960s. \\nHellman followed up with Ride in the Whirlwind (1966). Screenwriter Rudolph Wurlitzer is considered \"the individual most responsible for exploring this genre, having practically invented it himself in the late \\'60s and then helped to nurture it in the scripts of others\", such as McBride\\'s Glen and Randa, Hellman\\'s Two-Lane Blacktop, Cox\\'s Walker, and Sam Peckinpah\\'s Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.[4] Wurlitzer worked on the script of Gone Beaver, which Rosenbaum describes as \"a visionary script\" for Jim McBride. It was an ambitious big-budget Western about early American trappers and Indians, for which a virtually invented language of \"trapper talk\" was devised. The film was aborted one day before production.[6] Wurlitzer\\'s unproduced 1970s screenplay Zebulon inspired Jarmusch\\'s Dead Man. Wurlitzer later transformed his script into the novel The Drop Edge of Yonder.\\nRosenbaum calls Dead Man a \"much-delayed fulfillment\" of the acid Western, \"formulating a chilling, savage frontier poetry to justify its hallucinated agenda.\"[1] More recently, Jan Kounen\\'s Blueberry from 2004 was cited as an example of the genre.[7]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAustralian Western, also known as  meat pie Western or kangaroo Western, is a genre of Western-style films or TV series set in the Australian outback or \"the bush\". Films about bushrangers (sometimes called bushranger films) are included in this genre. Some films categorised as meat-pie or Australian Westerns also fulfil the criteria for other genres, such as drama, revisionist Western, crime or thriller. A sub-genre of the Australian Western, the Northern, has been coined by the makers of High Ground (2020), to describe a film set in the Northern Territory that accurately depicts historical events in a fictionalised form, that has aspects of a thriller.\\nThe term \"meat pie Western\" is a play on the term Spaghetti Western, used for Italian-made Westerns. Since Westerns are a genre associated with the United States, the food qualifiers indicate the origin of other cultures that play with the characteristics of the genre. Historically some Australian Westerns were made specifically with the influence of US Westerns in mind. The Ealing Westerns, made in Australia, are particular examples of this, though they depict Australian history.\\nOne connection has been the parallel between the two native people, and their treatment by settlers and the white colonial people. In the case of Australia, Aboriginal Australians, and in the US, the Native Americans.[1] Cattle ranches and vast tracts of land are both similar themes, being borrowed from US Westerns and used in Australia, in particular the movie The Overlanders (1946).[2]\\nThe definition of what is an Australian Western (i.e. taking its influence from US cinema) and what is simply an Australian historical film set in the era that covers similar themes, is fluid. Cinema about bushrangers, which some regard as Australian Westerns, goes back to some of the first Australian feature films.[3] Ned Kelly, as subject of a feature film, was first made in 1906, in The Story of the Kelly Gang. The British company Ealing Studios, made a number of Westerns in Australian in the 1940s and \\'50s, including The Overlanders (1946), about a cattle drive, which was marketed in Australia as a drama, but marketed overseas as an \"Australian Western\".[4] It starred Australian actor Chips Rafferty and was successful at the box office. Another British film production house, Rank, made Robbery Under Arms in 1957.[5] One of the prominent post-war productions made in Australia was the technicolour Western, Kangaroo. This was a big budget (800,000 pounds) film made by 20th Century Fox in 1952, starring imported stars Maureen O\\'Hara and Peter Lawford.[6] Mad Dog Morgan, was made in the 1970s, carrying Western themes along with Ozploitation cinema[7]\\nThe term \"kangaroo Western\" is used in an article about The Man from Snowy River (1982) in that year,[8] and Stuart Cunningham refers to Charles Chauvel’s Greenhide (1926) as a “kangaroo Western” in 1989.[9][10]\\nGrayson Cooke attributes the first use of the term \"meat-pie Western\" to Eric Reade in his History and Heartburn (1979),[11] referring to Russell Hagg\\'s Raw Deal (1977).[9] This term is again used in 1981 in an Australian Women\\'s Weekly column by John-Michael Howson (about a film planned to be made in Australia by James Komack, but apparently never made). Howson compares the term to the \"Spaghetti Western\".[12] Historian Troy Lennon (2018) says that meat pie Westerns have been around for more than a century.[13]\\nCooke (2014) posits that the Australian Western genre never developed a \"classic\" or mature phase. He lists the following as broad categories: \"the early bushranger and bush adventure films; Westerns shot in Australia by foreign production studios; contemporary re-makes of bushranger films; and contemporary revisionist Westerns, noting that most fall into the bushranger category (with only The Tracker and The Proposition falling into the latter category at that time). Other recent films, such as Ivan Sen\\'s Mystery Road (2013), a crime film, also uses some of the Western themes.[9]\\nEmma Hamilton, of the University of Newcastle, refers to the Australian Western, kangaroo Western and meat-pie Western as alternative terms, in her exploration of the development of the Western genre in Australia comparing film representations of Ned Kelly. She refers to the work of Cooke and other writers, paraphrasing Peter Limbrick\\'s view that the Western is basically \"about societies making sense of imperial-colonial relationships\", and considers the parallels between American and Australian histories. Hamilton lists a number of films which can be termed Australian Westerns by virtue of being set in Australia but maintaining elements of American Western conventions. The list includes, amongst many others, Robbery Under Arms (1920), Captain Fury (1939), Eureka Stockade (1949) and The Shiralee (1957).[14]\\nDirector Stephen Johnson and his team of filmmakers dubbed their creation, High Ground, set in the Northern Territory, a \"Northern\".[a] Johnson said \"We really feel it\\'s a film that immerses the audience in a time and place and that perhaps hasn\\'t happened in this way before\", and producer Witiyana Marika called it a \"northern action thriller\". The feature fiction film is based on many stories of the First Nations people of Arnhem Land that are not told in the history books.[15][16] Johnson also said \"There\\'s a thriller aspect to it. It\\'s not a Western, it\\'s a Northern\".[17]\\nThe Story of the Kelly Gang (1906) could be said to be the first in the genre (and possibly the world\\'s first feature film[14]), with \"good guys, bad guys, gunfights [and] horseback chases\". In 1911 and 1912, the state governments of South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria all banned depictions of bushrangers in films, which lasted for about 30 years and at first had a significantly deleterious effect on the Australian film industry.[9][13][14]\\nFilms in the Western genre continued to be made through the rest of the 20th century, many with Hollywood collaboration (such as Rangle River based on a Zane Grey novel in 1936), and some British (such as the Ealing Studios\\' The Overlanders in 1946).[13] Ned Kelly (1970) and The Man from Snowy River (1982) were the most notable examples of the genre in the second half of the century.[13][14]\\nSome films in the genre, such as Red Hill, The Proposition, and Sweet Country, re-examine the treatment of Aboriginal Australians and focus on racism and sexism in Australian history,[18][19]  with the latter two of these being successful with both critics and box-office.[13]\\nA variety of Westerns has been made since 1990 in Australia. Ned Kelly, Australia\\'s most infamous bank robber, featured in two films, Ned Kelly (2003) and The True History of the Kelly Gang (2019).[20] Also notable were The Legend of Ben Hall[citation needed] (2017) and The Tracker (2002).[21] The Proposition (2005) was a \"revisionist Western\" or \"anti-Western\" film influenced by Robert Altman and Sam Peckinpah\\'s work.[22]  The 2008 film, Australia, was an epic Western which included other genres such as adventure, action, drama, war and romance.[23] Sweet Country, about European settlers\\' incursions into Aboriginal Australians\\' traditional lands, was made in 2017.[24]\\n',\n",
       "  'Contemporary Western is a subgenre of the Western genre that includes contemporary settings and uses Old West themes, archetypes, and motifs, such as a rebellious antihero, open plains and desert landscapes, or gunfights.  This sub-genre includes the post-Western, neo-Western, and urban Western genres that include \"the cowboy cult\" in a modern setting that involves the audience\\'s feelings and understanding of Western movies.[1] A neo-Western can be said to use Western themes set in the present day.[2]:\\u200a62\\u200a According to Stephen Teo in Eastern Westerns: Film and Genre Outside and Inside Hollywood, there is little difference between the neo-Western and post-Western, and the terms may often be used interchangeably.[3]:\\u200a96\\u200a\\nAs early as 1929, there was talk about the need for change in Western films in order to stay relevant in then-modern America (\"Tom Mix, Hoot Gibson and Ken Maynard must swap horses for aeroplanes or go to the old actors\\' home.\"). However, the rise of the contemporary Western is credited to two specific reasons: 1) contemporary setting enabled the use of a higher number of potential plot-ideas, which \"included everything from modern crooks and evil Nazis to high-tech cars and machine guns\"; 2) Gene Autry, a famous Western film star, was also a famous singer and performer. In order to use his reputation as much as possible, Republic Pictures decided that it was best for Autry to play himself, thus moving the films from the Old West into a contemporary setting. Some earlier actors, such as Ken Maynard and Hoot Gibson, sometimes starred in the films featuring modern setting, but Autry was the first actor starring in such films on a regular basis.[4]:\\u200a109\\u200a Autry\\'s films were also described as \"crime dramas in contemporary Western setting\".[5]:\\u200a100\\u200a\\nOther early examples of the genre were films starring Roy Rogers which included contemporary settings with heavy reliance on traditional western characters and imagery, such as Silver Spurs (1943). His films made after 1947 are described as \"almost without exception, modern-day adventure films set in the American west\".[6]:\\u200a90,\\u200a153\\u200a Republic Pictures, which distributed a significant number of Autry\\'s and Rogers\\'s films, soon specialized in the contemporary Western subgenre, an example of which is also Paramount\\'s Texas Rangers Ride Again (1940).[6]:\\u200a153\\u200a\\nBeginning in the postwar era, radio dramas such as Tales of the Texas Rangers (1950–1952), with Joel McCrea, a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featured many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.[7]  In this period, post-Western precursors to the modern neo-Western films began to appear.  This includes films such as Nicholas Ray\\'s The Lusty Men (1952) and John Sturges\\'s Bad Day at Black Rock (1955).[8]:\\u200a56\\u200a Examples of the modern \"first phase\" of neo-Westerns include films such as Lonely Are the Brave (1962) and Hud (1963).[8]:\\u200a324\\u200a  The popularity of the subgenre has been resurgent since the release of Joel and Ethan Coen\\'s No Country for Old Men (2007).[9]\\nThe subgenre can also be seen in television in shows such as Breaking Bad.  According to Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, \"After the first Breaking Bad episode, it started to dawn on me that we could be making a contemporary Western. So you see scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like Clint Eastwood and Lee van Cleef—we have Walt and others like that.\"[10]\\nMany space Westerns and science fiction Westerns can be classed within the neo-Western genre, particularly if the science fiction elements are of secondary importance to the Western characteristics of the plotlines. Some well-known examples include the original TV series Star Trek (1966–1969) and the Joss Whedon film Serenity (2005).[11] Other kinds of science fiction Westerns, such as the film Mad Max (1979), have also become popular.\\nSome neo-Westerns still take place in the American West and reveal the progression of the Old West mentality into the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This subgenre often features Old West-type characters struggling with displacement in a \"civilized\" world that rejects their \"outdated\" brand of justice.  However, the contemporary Western need not be limited to the traditional American West setting. Coogan\\'s Bluff and Midnight Cowboy are examples of urban Westerns set in New York City.[1]:\\u200a148–149\\u200a The neo-Western television series Justified is set in Eastern Kentucky.[12]\\nThe neo-Western has three identifying themes. First is the lack of rules, with morals guided by the character\\'s or audience\\'s instincts of right and wrong rather than by governance. The second is characters searching for justice. The third theme, characters feeling remorse, connects the neo-Western to the broader Western genre, reinforcing a universal theme that consequences come with actions.[9] Other conventions of the genre include \"virility and thus patriarchal rights... secured through public performances of competence; and competence, in turn, is measured and proven in (successful) acts of violence.\"[13] Taylor Sheridan\\'s filmography includes many examples of what being a neo-Western means.[9]\\nThis list is not exhaustive. It includes major films and television labelled contemporary Western, neo-Western, post-Western, or urban Western. The list highlights the media released to illustrate the development of the concept over time.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nDacoity is a term used for \"banditry\" in the Indian subcontinent. The spelling is the anglicised version of the Hindi word डाकू (ḍākū); \"dacoit\" /dəˈkɔɪt/ is a colloquial Indian English word with this meaning. It appears in the Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases (1903).[1] Banditry is a criminal activity involving robbery by groups of armed bandits. The East India Company established the Thuggee and Dacoity Department in 1830, and the Thuggee and Dacoity Suppression Acts, 1836–1848 were enacted in British India under East India Company rule.[2]  Areas with ravines or forests, such as Chambal and Chilapata Forests, were once known for dacoits.\\nThe word \"dacoity\" is an anglicized version of the Hindi word ḍakaitī (historically transliterated dakaitee). Hindi डकैती comes from ḍākū (historically transliterated dakoo, Hindi: डाकू, meaning \"armed robber\").[3][4]\\nThe term dacoit (Hindi: डकैत ḍakait) means \"a bandit\" according to the OED (\"A member of a class of robbers in India and Burma, who plunder in armed bands\").[3][4]\\nThe dacoity have had a large impact in the Bhind and Morena of Chambal regions in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in north-central India.[5] The exact reasons for the emergence of dacoity in the Chambal valley have been disputed. Most explanations have suggested feudal exploitation as the cause that provoked many people in this region to take arms. The area was also underdeveloped and poor, so banditry posed great economic incentives.[5] However, the fact that many gangs operating in this valley were composed of higher castes and wealthy people appears to suggest that feudalism may only be a partial explanation of dacoity in Chambal Valley (Bhaduri, 1972; Khan, 1981; Jatar, 1980; Katare, 1972). Furthermore, traditional honour codes and blood feuds would drive some into criminality.[5]\\nIn Chambal, India, organized crime controlled much of the countryside from the time of the British Raj up to the early 2000s, with the police offering high rewards for the most notorious bandit chiefs. The criminals regularly targeted local businesses, though they preferred to kidnap wealthy people and demand ransom from their relatives - cutting off fingers, noses, and ears to pressure them into paying high sums. Many dacoity also posed as social bandits toward the local poor, paying medical bills and funding weddings. One ex-dacoit described his criminal past by claiming that \"I was a rebel. I fought injustice.\"[5] Following intense anti-banditry campaigns by the Indian Police, highway robbery was almost completely eradicated in the early 2000s. Nevertheless, Chambal is still popularly believed to be unsafe and bandit-infested by many Indians. One police officer noted that the fading of dacoity was also due to social changes, as few young people were any longer willing to endure the harsh life of highway robbers in the countryside. Instead, they prefer to join crime groups in the city, where life is easier.[5]\\nWhile thugs and dacoits operating in northern and central India are more popularly known and referenced in books, films, and academic journals, a significant number of accounts also come from Bengal. Writing about the dacoits of Bengal, the colonial official CH Keighly mentions the “great difference between gangs of hereditary dacoits or thugs in other parts of India and the dacoits of Bengal”.[6] It is notable that, unlike the rest of India, dacoits in Bengal did not come from a particular social class, caste, or creed.\\nDacoit gangs in Nadia and Hooghly were mainly known for their ceremonial practices before the night of dacoity. Before setting off for their mission, the members would assemble to perform “kalipuja” led by the Sirdar (leader). The dacoits would form a straight line, and a pot of liquor, torches, and weapons to be used in the dacoity would be laid down in a clear space. The Sirdar would then dip his finger in oil and touch the forehead of all the dacoits, making them promise never to confess. Even during the raid, when dacoits opened chests and discovered a good fortune, they would shout “Kali, Jai Kali”.[6]\\nDacoity was prevalent in 19th century West Bengal. One of the gangs, led by a charismatic leader named Bhabani Pathak, was known for its loyalty to their leader. After the British captured Bhabani, the inner workings and social factors that led to the construction of this gang were revealed. Leaders such as Bhabani were known as Sirdars and had a symbiotic relationship with their followers.[6] Among other benefits, a Sirdar would lend loans to members and provide them protection. This allowed for the formation of a special bond between Sirdar and his followers, which meant that cases of desertion and exiting the gang were virtually unheard of.\\nIn Burdwan, dacoities were heavily planned, and considerable thought was put into their seamless execution. Sirdars in Burdwan employed several informants who kept them updated about prospective targets.[6] When a target was finalized, the Sirdar and relevant gang members were constantly made aware of his whereabouts. The informants were always on the lookout for wealthy business people and kept a close watch on those who exchanged bank notes of considerable value or received a shipment of merchandise they would store in their houses.\\nThe term is also applied, according to the OED, to \"pirates who formerly infested the Ganges between Calcutta and Burhampore\".\\nDacoits existed in Burma as well—Rudyard Kipling\\'s fictional Private Mulvaney hunted Burmese dacoits in \"The Taking of Lungtungpen.\" Sax Rohmer \\'s criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu also employed Burmese dacoits as his henchmen.\\nIndian police forces use \"Known Dacoit\" (K.D.) as a label to classify criminals.\\nIntroduced in 1836, the suppression acts brought about several legislative measures, including establishing special courts, authorization for using rewards for informants, and the power to arrest suspects.[7] The suppression acts marked the beginning of active British intervention in policing and law enforcement in Indian society. These acts were known to be authoritarian and further deepened the uneven power dynamic between the British and the Indians.\\nThe British often saw Indians as primitive, violent, and unruly, and this often acted as a justification for colonization and further consolidated their “civilization mission” pretext. The practice of thuggee and dacoity was seen in a similar Eurocentric light without understanding the local context. An orientalist view of such activities was portrayed in the rest of the world to account for several repressive legislative measures that the British took. Under this punitive approach, several innocent individuals fell prey to false suspicion and were incriminated.[8]\\nNotable dacoits include:\\nIn Madhya Pradesh, women belonging to a village defence group have been issued firearm permits to fend off dacoity. The Chief minister of the state, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, recognised the role the women had played in defending their villages without guns. He stated that he wanted to enable these women to better defend both themselves and their villages, and issued the gun permits to advance this goal.[20]\\nAs the dacoits flourished through the 1940s–1970s, they were the subject of various Hindi films made during this era, leading to the emergence of the dacoit film genre in Hindi Film Industry.[21] The genre began with Mehboob Khan\\'s Aurat (1940), which he remade as Mother India (1957). Mother India received an Academy Award nomination, and defined the dacoit film genre, along with Dilip Kumar\\'s Gunga Jumna (1961).[22] Other popular films in this genre included Raj Kapoor’s Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai (1961) and Moni Bhattacharjee\\'s Mujhe Jeene Do (1963).[23]\\nPakistani actor Akmal Khan had two dacoit films, Malangi (1965) and Imam Din Gohavia (1967). Other films in this genre included Khote Sikkay (1973), Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971), and Kuchhe Dhaage (1973) both by Raj Khosla.\\nThe most famous dacoit film is Sholay (1975), written by Salim–Javed, and starring Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, and Amjad Khan as the dacoit character Gabbar Singh. It was a masala film that combined the dacoit film conventions of Mother India and Gunga Jumna with that of Spaghetti Westerns, spawning the \"Dacoit Western\" genre,[22] also known as the \"Curry Western\" genre. The film also borrowed elements from Akira Kurosawa\\'s Seven Samurai.[24] Sholay became a classic in the genre, and its success led to a surge of films in this genre, including Ganga Ki Saugandh (1978), once again starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amjad Khan.\\nAn internationally acclaimed example of the genre is Bandit Queen (1994).\\nThe Tamil movie starring Karthi, Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru (2017) deals elaborately with bandits. The film reveals the real dacoity incidents which held in Tamil Nadu between 1995 and 2005. Director Vinoth did a two-year research about bandits to develop the script.\\nA related genre of crime films are Mumbai underworld films.\\nBengali novel Devi Chowdhurani by author Bankim Chandra Chatterjee in 1867.\\nBengali poem Birpurush by Rabindranath Tagore in 1903.\\nA Hindi novel named Painstth Lakh ki Dacoity (1977) was written by Surender Mohan Pathak; it was translated as The 65 Lakh Heist.\\nDacoits armed with pistols and swords appear in Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties.\\nThey frequently appeared in the French language Bob Morane series of novels by Henri Vernes, principally as the main thugs or assassins of the hero\\'s recurring villain, Mr. Ming and in English as the agents of Sax Rohmer\\'s Fu Manchu.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nThe Western is a genre set in the American frontier and commonly associated with folk tales of the Western United States, particularly the Southwestern United States, as well as Northern Mexico and Western Canada. It is commonly referred to as the \"Old West\" or the \"Wild West\" and depicted in Western media as a hostile, sparsely populated frontier in a state of near-total lawlessness patrolled by outlaws, sheriffs, and numerous other stock gunslinger characters. Western narratives often concern the gradual attempts to tame the crime-ridden American West using wider themes of justice, freedom, rugged individualism, manifest destiny, and the national history and identity of the United States.\\nWithin the larger scope of the Western genre, there are several recognized subgenres.  Some subgenres, such as spaghetti Westerns, maintain standard Western settings and plots, while others take the Western theme and archetypes into different supergenres, such as neo-Westerns or space Westerns.\\nFor a time, Westerns made in countries other than the United States were often labeled by foods associated with the culture, such as spaghetti Westerns (Italy), meat pie Westerns (Australia), ramen Westerns (Asia), and masala Westerns (India).[1]\\nFilm critic Jonathan Rosenbaum refers to a makeshift 1960s and 1970s genre called the acid Western,[2] associated with Dennis Hopper, Jim McBride, and Rudy Wurlitzer, as well as films such as Monte Hellman\\'s The Shooting (1966), Alejandro Jodorowsky\\'s bizarre experimental film El Topo (The Mole) (1970),[2] and Robert Downey Sr.\\'s Greaser\\'s Palace (1972).[2] The 1970 film El Topo is an allegorical cult Western and underground film about the eponymous character, a violent black-clad gunfighter, and his quest for enlightenment. The film is filled with bizarre characters and occurrences, use of maimed and dwarf performers, and heavy doses of Christian symbolism and Eastern philosophy. Some spaghetti Westerns also crossed over into the acid Western genre, such as Enzo G. Castellari\\'s mystical Keoma (1976), a Western reworking of Ingmar Bergman\\'s The Seventh Seal (1957).\\nMore recent acid Westerns include Alex Cox\\'s Walker (1987) and Jim Jarmusch\\'s Dead Man (1995). Rosenbaum describes the acid Western as \"formulating a chilling, savage frontier poetry to justify its hallucinated agenda\"; ultimately, he says, the acid Western expresses a counterculture sensibility to critique and replace capitalism with alternative forms of exchange.[3]\\nThe Australian Western genre or meat pie Western is set in Australia, especially the Australian Outback or the Australian Bush.[4] The genre borrows from US traditions.\\nThe Tracker is an archetype in this form of Australian Western, with signature scenes of harsh desert environments, and exploration of the themes of rough justice, exploitation of the Aboriginals, and the thirst for justice at all costs. Others in this category include Rangle River (1936), Kangaroo, The Kangaroo Kid (1950),The Sundowners (1960), Quigley Down Under (1990),  Ned Kelly (1970), The Man from Snowy River (1982), The Proposition, Lucky Country, and Sweet Country.[5]\\nMystery Road is an example of a modern Australian Western, and Mad Max has inspired many futurist dystopian examples of the Australian Western such as The Rover.\\nMany blaxploitation films, particularly ones involving Fred Williamson, have incorporated a Western setting within them. They are often characterized by excessive violence, stilted dialalog, and macho heroes. Examples include Soul Soldier (1970), Buck and the Preacher (1972), The Legend of Nigger Charley (1972), The Soul of Nigger Charley (1973), Thomasine & Bushrod (1974), Boss Nigger (1975), Adiós Amigo (1975), and Posse (1993).[6][7]\\nCharro Westerns, often featuring musical stars, as well as action, have been a standard feature of Mexican cinema since the 1930s. In the 1930s and 1940s, these were typically films about horsemen in rural Mexican society, displaying a set of cultural concerns very different from the Hollywood metanarrative, but the overlap between \"charro\" movies and Westerns became more apparent in the 1950s, \\'60s, and \\'70s. Some examples are Ismael Rodríguez\\'s Los Hermanos del Hierro (1961), Jorge Fons\\'s Cinco Mil Dólares de Recompensa, and Arturo Ripstein\\'s Tiempo de morir. The most important is Alberto Mariscal, great author of El tunco Maclovio, Todo por nada, Los marcados, El juez de la soga, and La chamuscada.[8][9]\\nThe Western is a popular genre in the Asian film industry.[10]:\\u200a1\\u200a Examples of the Chinese Western genre include Millionaires Express (1986), Let the Bullets Fly (2010) and Once Upon a Time in China and America (1997).\\nThis subgenre is imitative in style to mock, comment on, or trivialize the Western genre\\'s established traits, subjects, auteurs\\' styles, or some other target by means of humorous, satiric, or ironic imitation or parody. A prime example of comedy Western includes The Paleface (1948), which makes a satirical effort to \"send up Owen Wister\\'s novel The Virginian and all the cliches of the Western from the fearless hero to the final shootout on Main Street\".  The Paleface \"features a cowardly hero known as \"Painless\" Peter Potter (Bob Hope), an inept dentist, who often entertains the notion that he is a crack sharpshooter and accomplished Indian fighter\".[11]\\nOther examples include:\\nContemporary Western (or neo-Westerns or urban Westerns) have contemporary settings and use Old West themes, archetypes, and motifs, such as a rebellious antihero, open plains and desert landscapes, or gunfights.  This also includes the post-Western, with modern settings and \"the cowboy cult\" that involve the audience\\'s feelings and understanding of Western movies.[13] This subgenre often features Old West-type characters struggling with displacement in a \"civilized\" world that rejects their outdated brand of justice.  Some contemporary Westerns take place in the American West and reveal the progression of the Old West mentality into the late 20th and early 21st centuries; but the genre is not limited to the traditional American West setting. Coogan\\'s Bluff and Midnight Cowboy are examples of urban Westerns set in New York City.[13]:\\u200a148–149\\u200a\\nTypical themes of the neo-Western are the lack of rules, with morals guided by the character\\'s or audience\\'s instincts of right and wrong rather than by governance, characters searching for justice, and characters feeling remorse, connecting the neo-Western to the broader Western genre.[14] Other conventions of the genre include displays of competence, which in turn is measured in acts of violence.[15]\\nBeginning in the postwar era, radio dramas such as Tales of the Texas Rangers (1950–1952), with Joel McCrea, a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featured many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.[16]  In this period, post-Western precursors to the modern neo-Western films began to appear, such as Nicholas Ray\\'s The Lusty Men (1952) and John Sturges\\'s Bad Day at Black Rock (1955).[17]:\\u200a56\\u200a Examples of the modern \"first phase\" of neo-Westerns include films such as Lonely Are the Brave (1962) and Hud (1963).[17]:\\u200a324\\u200a  The popularity of the subgenre has been resurgent since the release of Joel and Ethan Coen\\'s No Country for Old Men (2007).[14]\\nThe neo-Western subgenre can also be seen in modern American television shows such as Breaking Bad, [18] Justified,[19] and Yellowstone.[20]\\nThe Bollywood film Sholay (1975) was often referred to as a \"curry Western\".[21] A more accurate genre label for the film is the \"dacoit Western\", as it combines the conventions of Indian dacoit films such as Mother India (1957) and Gunga Jumna (1961) with those of spaghetti Westerns. Sholay spawned its own genre of \"dacoit Western\" films in Bollywood during the 1970s.[22]\\nThe first Western films made in India – Kalam Vellum (1970, Tamil), Mosagallaku Mosagadu (1971, Telugu), Ganga (1972, Tamil), and Jakkamma (1972, Tamil) – were based on classic Westerns. Thazhvaram (1990), the Malayalam film directed by Bharathan and written by noted writer M. T. Vasudevan Nair, perhaps most resembles the spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as Adima Changala (1971) starring Prem Nazir, a hugely popular zapata spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and Sholay (1975) Khote Sikkay (1973) and Thai Meethu Sathiyam (1978) are notable curry Westerns. Kodama Simham (1990), a Telugu action film, starring Chiranjeevi and Mohan Babu, was one more addition to the Indo Western genre that fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as Hunters of the Indian Treasure.[23]\\nTakkari Donga (2002), starring Telugu actor Mahesh Babu, was applauded by critics, but was average at box office. Quick Gun Murugun (2009), an Indian comedy film that spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promotions at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.[24] Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Jaishankar, was made in Tamil. Laal Kaptaan (2019) is an IndoWestern starring Saif Ali Khan, which is set during the rise of the British Empire in India.\\nThe documentary Western is a subgenre of Westerns that explore the nonfiction elements of the historical and contemporary American West.  Between 1894 and 1899, Edison\\'s early use of film included several examples of documentaries that introduced Western characters and settings.  Among them were Parade of Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West Show.  His work showcased Native American ceremonial dance films such as Eagle Dance and Indian Day School, working cowboys in Branding Cattle, and scenic attractions such as Royal Gorge and Coaches Going to Cinnabar from Yellowstone Park.[25]\\nKen Burns\\'s The West is an example of a series based upon a historical storyline, whereas films such as Cowboys: A Documentary Portrait provide a nonfiction portrayal of modern working cowboys in the contemporary West.\\nThe 1971 film Zachariah starring John Rubinstein, Don Johnson, and Pat Quinn, was billed as the \"first electric Western\".[26] The film featured multiple performing rock bands in an otherwise American West setting.[26]\\nZachariah featured appearances and music supplied by rock groups from the 1970s, including the James Gang[26] and Country Joe and the Fish as \"The Cracker Band\".[26] Fiddler Doug Kershaw had a musical cameo[26] as does Elvin Jones as a gunslinging drummer named Job Cain.[26]\\nThe independent film Hate Horses starring Dominique Swain, Ron Thompson, and Paul Dooley billed itself as the \"second electric Western\".[27]\\nThe epic Western is a subgenre of the Western that emphasizes the story of the American Old West on a grand scale.[28]:\\u200a124\\u200a Many epic Westerns are set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone\\'s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), set during the American Civil War,[29]:\\u200a193\\u200a or Sam Peckinpah\\'s The Wild Bunch (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution.[30] One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone\\'s Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while using wide-scale shots of Monument Valley locations against a broad running-time.[31][29]:\\u200a195\\u200a\\nIn the silent film era, The Covered Wagon (1923) with J. Warren Kerrigan, was the first epic Western filmed entirely on location.[29]:\\u200a76\\u200a Another silent epic was The Iron Horse (1924) with George O\\'Brien.[28]:\\u200a136\\u200a\\nOther notable examples include Duel in the Sun (1946)[28]:\\u200a127\\u200a with Joseph Cotten and Gregory Peck, The Searchers (1956) with John Wayne, Giant (1956) with Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean, The Big Country (1958) with Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston, Cimarron (1960) with Glenn Ford, How the West Was Won (1962) with James Stewart and Henry Fonda (among many others), Custer of the West (1967) with Robert Shaw, Duck, You Sucker! (1971) with Rod Steiger and James Coburn, Heaven\\'s Gate (1980) with Isabelle Huppert, Dances with Wolves (1990) with Kevin Costner, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) with Brad Pitt, Django Unchained (2012) with Jamie Foxx, The Revenant (2015) with Leonardo DiCaprio, and Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1 (2024).\\nEuro-Westerns are Western-genre films made in Western Europe. The term can sometimes include the spaghetti Western subgenre. One example of a Euro-Western is the Anglo-Spanish film The Savage Guns (1961). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed sauerkraut Westerns[32] because they were made in Germany and shot in Yugoslavia, were derived from stories by novelist Karl May, and were film adaptations of May\\'s work. One of the most popular German Western franchises was the Winnetou series, which featured a Native American Apache hero in the lead role. Also in Finland, only a few Western films have been made, the most notable of which could be the 1971 low-budget comedy The Unhanged, directed by, written by, and starring Spede Pasanen.\\nSome new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including Kristian Levring\\'s The Salvation, Martin Koolhoven\\'s Brimstone, and Andreas Prochaska\\'s The Dark Valley.\\nExploitation Western is a subgenre of the Exploitation film, a genre characterized by \"exploiting\" lurid and graphic content throughout 1960s and 1970s up to the early 1980s. Examples of exploitation Western films include Soldier Blue (1970), Cain\\'s Cutthroats (1971), Cut-Throats Nine (1972) and Kid Vengeance (1977).\\nFantasy Westerns mixed in fantasy settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are Stephen King\\'s The Stand and The Dark Tower series of novels, the Vertigo comics series Preacher, and Keiichi Sigsawa\\'s light novel series, Kino\\'s Journey, illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi.\\nFlorida Westerns, also known as cracker Westerns, are set in Florida during the Second Seminole War. An example is Distant Drums (1951) starring Gary Cooper.\\nGaucho Westerns are films set in the 18th century in South America\\'s pampas following stories of gauchos, cowhands and swashbucklers getting into adventures akin to the cowboys portrayed in American movies of the era. Notable examples of gaucho Westerns include Nobleza gaucha (1915), The Gaucho (1927), The Gaucho War (1942), Way of a Gaucho (1952), Savage Pampas (1966), Don Segundo Sombra (1969), The Ardor (2014) and The Settlers (2023). An example of a gaucho neo-Western would be The Ones From Below (2023).[33]\\nAccording to the naming conventions after spaghetti Western, in Greece they are also referred to as \"fasolada Westerns\" (Greek: φασολάδα = bean soup, i.e. one of the national dishes of Greece). Notable examples are Blood on the Land (1966), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film,[34] and Bullets don\\'t come back (1967).[35][36]\\nThe horror Western subgenre has roots in films such as Curse of the Undead (1959), Jesse James Meets Frankenstein\\'s Daughter (1965), and Billy the Kid vs. Dracula (1966), which depicts the legendary outlaw Billy the Kid fighting against the notorious vampire. Another example is The Ghoul Goes West, an unproduced Ed Wood film to star Bela Lugosi as Dracula in the Old West.[37]  Newer examples include the films Near Dark (1987) directed by Kathryn Bigelow, which tells the story about a human falling in love with a vampire, From Dusk till Dawn (1996) by Robert Rodriguez deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, Vampires (1998) by John Carpenter, which tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, Ravenous (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; The Burrowers (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012). Undead Nightmare (2010), an expansion to Red Dead Redemption (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a zombie outbreak in the Old West. Bone Tomahawk (2015) received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism, but like many other movies in the genre, it was not a commercial success. Jordan Peele\\'s film Nope (2022) combines horror and science fiction with a neo-Western lens. It depicts two rancher siblings attempting to capture evidence of a UFO terrorizing their remote desert ranch.\\nA generic term for a Western which is combined with another genre such as horror, film noir or martial arts.[38] Dynamite Warrior is a martial arts fantasy Western set in Thailand.\\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., Billy Jack (1971) and its sequel The Trial of Billy Jack (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the Kung Fu TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson collaboration Shanghai Noon (2000). Further subdivisions of this subgenre include Westerns based on ninjas and samurais (incorporating samurai cinema themes), such as Red Sun (1971) with Charles Bronson, Alain Delon, and Toshiro Mifune.\\nThere have been many musical films with a Western setting and many musicians have appeared in Western films, sometimes in non-musical roles. Singers Doris Day and Howard Keel worked together in Calamity Jane, a huge success on release which remains one of the most popular Western musicals. On the other hand, crooner Dean Martin and pop singer Ricky Nelson played the parts of gunfighters in Rio Bravo, which is not a musical, although they did combine to sing a couple of songs in the middle of the film while they were guarding the jailhouse.[39]\\nA subgenre that highlights Mexican narcoculture and portrays drug trafficking and traffickers (real or imagined).[40] Narco Westerns are typically set in Northern Mexico, the Southwest United States, or on the border between the two.[41] A relatively new genre, Hilario Peña states the narco Western is the Western for the \"modern age,\" and that \"instead of a horse, the character drives a truck, and instead of fighting Apaches, the character must defeat criminals and the federal police in the state of Sinaloa.\"[42][43] Examples of narco Westerns include the American television shows Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, as well as the films Miss Bala, El Infierno and Heli.[44][41] They may also come in the form of literature or telenovelas. Narco Westerns often feature narratives of personal identity, usually the struggles of a cowboy-like anti-hero, while focusing on themes of life and death, love and loss, greed and desire, and hope and pain. Dry or dark humor is sometimes used. Most notably, Narco Westerns frequently showcase graphic portrayals of addiction, violence, and narcoterrorism.[45][41]\\nThe Northern genre is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in Alaska or Western Canada. Examples include several versions of the Rex Beach novel, The Spoilers (including 1930\\'s The Spoilers, with Gary Cooper, and 1942\\'s The Spoilers, with Marlene Dietrich, Randolph Scott, and Wayne); The Far Country (1954) with James Stewart; North to Alaska (1960) with Wayne;  Death Hunt (1981) with Charles Bronson; and The Grey Fox (1983) with Richard Farnsworth.\\nOstern films were Western-style films produced in the Soviet Union and Socialist Eastern Europe. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of Joseph Stalin. Osterns are typically divided between \"Easterns\", which sought to portray an Eastern European analogue to the Wild West set in frontier regions across Eurasia, and \"Red Westerns\", which were set in the American West but sought to subvert the ideas of manifest destiny and other narratives typical of Hollywood Westerns in favor of Marxist ideals of proletarian internationalism and class consciousness.\\nRed Western films usually portrayed the American Indians sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed them as villains. Osterns frequently featured Gypsy or Turkic people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Native Americans in Eastern Europe.\\nGojko Mitic portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian chiefs (e.g., in Die Söhne der großen Bärin (1966), directed by Josef Mach). He became honorary chief of the Sioux tribe when he visited the United States, in the 1990s, and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe of one of his films. American actor and singer Dean Reed, an expatriate who lived in East Germany, also starred in several Ostern films.\\n\"Eastern\" films typically replaced the Wild West setting with by an Eastern setting in the steppes of the Caucasus. Western stock characters, such as \"cowboys and Indians\", were also replaced by Caucasian stock characters, such as bandits and harems. A famous example of the genre was White Sun of the Desert, which was popular in the Soviet Union.[46]\\nPornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are Russ Meyer\\'s nudie-cutie Wild Gals of the Naked West (1962), and the hardcore A Dirty Western (1975) and Sweet Savage (1979). Sweet Savage starred Aldo Ray, a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, Custer\\'s Revenge (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the worst video games of all time.\\nFilm critic Philip French includes a subgenre of \"pre-Western\" to describe films that include themes and characters reminiscent of cowboy pictures but are not strictly regarded as Westerns.  This includes films with an early nineteenth century frontier setting with characters like James Fenimore Cooper\\'s Natty Bumppo. It includes examples like The Alamo (1960).[47]\\nFirst used in the publicity of the film Tampopo, the term \"ramen Western\" also is a play on words using a national dish. The term is used to describe Western style media set in Asia. Examples include The Drifting Avenger, Break the Chain, Millionaires Express, East Meets West, Tears of the Black Tiger and Dynamite Warrior, Let the Bullets Fly, Unforgiven, Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts, Buffalo Boys, The Good, the Bad and the Weird, Golden Kamuy and Sukiyaki Western Django.[48]\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Western was reinvented with the revisionist Western.[49] After the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make revisionist Westerns that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one\\'s character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah\\'s The Wild Bunch (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of Native Americans, who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include Ride the High Country (1962), Richard Harris\\' A Man Called Horse (1970), Little Big Man (1970), Soldier Blue (1970), Man in the Wilderness (1971), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Dances with Wolves (1990), Unforgiven (1992), The Quick and the Dead (1995), and Dead Man (1995). A television miniseries, Godless (2016), also fits into this category. A few earlier revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as Westward the Women (1951) starring Robert Taylor.  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, The Last Wagon (1956). In it, Richard Widmark played a white man raised by Comanches and persecuted by Whites, with Felicia Farr and Susan Kohner playing young women forced into leadership roles.\\nThe science fiction Western places science fiction elements within a traditional Western setting.[50]  Early examples are serial films such The Phantom Empire (1935) and Ghost Patrol (1936) which incorporated supernatural figures of science fiction fantasy into a Western setting.[50]  An example of cross-over genre, the fantasy science fiction Western The Valley of Gwangi (1969) displayed cowboys fighting dinosaurs, a trend that took hold during the 1960s. John Jakes\\'s Six Gun Planet takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...). The movie Westworld (1973) and its sequel Futureworld (1976), Back to the Future Part III (1990), Wild Wild West (1999), and Cowboys & Aliens (2011), and the television series Westworld (2016, based on the movie).\\nThis subgenre also encompasses the post-apocalyptic Western, an offshoot of the Western genre with themes of lawlessness and survival, and often include an alienated lone hero trying to make sense out of the chaos.[51]:\\u200a2\\u200a Examples include The Postman, the Mad Max series, and The Rover.[52][53][54] Science fiction Westerns may also incorporate steampunk elements, giving rise to the steampunk Western.[55]\\nA singing cowboy was a subtype of the archetypal cowboy hero of early Western films.[56][57] It references real-world campfire side ballads in the American frontier, the original cowboys sang of life on the trail with all the challenges, hardships, and dangers encountered while pushing cattle for miles up the trails and across the prairies.[58]\\nThe space Western is a subgenre of science fiction which uses the themes and tropes of Westerns within science-fiction stories.[50] Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in deep space, while more overt influences may feature literal cowboys in outer space who use ray guns and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American cartoon series BraveStarr (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988), the Japanese manga series Trigun (debuted in 1995), the Japanese anime series Cowboy Bebop (debuted in 1997), the American television series Firefly (created by Joss Whedon in 2002), and the films Battle Beyond the Stars (1980), which is a remake of The Magnificent Seven; Outland (1981), which is a remake of High Noon; and Serenity (2005, based on the Firefly TV series). The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science-fiction films such as the original Star Wars movie of 1977, with 2018\\'s Solo: A Star Wars Story and 2019\\'s The Mandalorian more directly featuring Western tropes. Gene Roddenberry\\'s concept of the TV show Star Trek was a \"Wagon Train to the stars\".[59]\\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in Italy with the \"spaghetti Westerns\", also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, the third film of the Dollars Trilogy.  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert region of Almería) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs, as well as their similarity to landscapes of the Southwestern United States. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.[60] Some spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered revisionist Westerns. For example, the Dollars Trilogy itself has much different tropes compared to standard Westerns, demythologizing the Sheriff figure (in A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More), putting both the Union and the Confederacy in ambiguously moral positions (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), and not featuring Native Americans (except for a brief mention in A Fistful of Dollars).\\nThe Western films directed by Sergio Leone were felt by some to have a different tone from the Hollywood Westerns.[61] Veteran American actors Charles Bronson, Lee Van Cleef, and Clint Eastwood[61] became famous by starring in spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as James Coburn, Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger, Klaus Kinski, Jason Robards, Gian Maria Volonte and Eli Wallach. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series Rawhide, unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone\\'s A Fistful of Dollars (the first in the Dollars Trilogy).[61]\\nThe weird Western combines elements of the classic Western with those of other genres, particularly fantasy, horror and science fiction.[62] This subgenre includes the steampunk Western subvariant, which incorporates the retrofuturistic elements of steampunk.[63] The Wild Wild West television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with steampunk.[64] The Jonah Hex franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film Western Religion (2015), by writer and director James O\\'Brien, introduces the devil into a traditional Wild West setting. The Old Man Logan (2008–2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post apocalyptic fiction with Westerns.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nThe Western is a genre set in the American frontier and commonly associated with folk tales of the Western United States, particularly the Southwestern United States, as well as Northern Mexico and Western Canada. It is commonly referred to as the \"Old West\" or the \"Wild West\" and depicted in Western media as a hostile, sparsely populated frontier in a state of near-total lawlessness patrolled by outlaws, sheriffs, and numerous other stock gunslinger characters. Western narratives often concern the gradual attempts to tame the crime-ridden American West using wider themes of justice, freedom, rugged individualism, manifest destiny, and the national history and identity of the United States.\\nWithin the larger scope of the Western genre, there are several recognized subgenres.  Some subgenres, such as spaghetti Westerns, maintain standard Western settings and plots, while others take the Western theme and archetypes into different supergenres, such as neo-Westerns or space Westerns.\\nFor a time, Westerns made in countries other than the United States were often labeled by foods associated with the culture, such as spaghetti Westerns (Italy), meat pie Westerns (Australia), ramen Westerns (Asia), and masala Westerns (India).[1]\\nFilm critic Jonathan Rosenbaum refers to a makeshift 1960s and 1970s genre called the acid Western,[2] associated with Dennis Hopper, Jim McBride, and Rudy Wurlitzer, as well as films such as Monte Hellman\\'s The Shooting (1966), Alejandro Jodorowsky\\'s bizarre experimental film El Topo (The Mole) (1970),[2] and Robert Downey Sr.\\'s Greaser\\'s Palace (1972).[2] The 1970 film El Topo is an allegorical cult Western and underground film about the eponymous character, a violent black-clad gunfighter, and his quest for enlightenment. The film is filled with bizarre characters and occurrences, use of maimed and dwarf performers, and heavy doses of Christian symbolism and Eastern philosophy. Some spaghetti Westerns also crossed over into the acid Western genre, such as Enzo G. Castellari\\'s mystical Keoma (1976), a Western reworking of Ingmar Bergman\\'s The Seventh Seal (1957).\\nMore recent acid Westerns include Alex Cox\\'s Walker (1987) and Jim Jarmusch\\'s Dead Man (1995). Rosenbaum describes the acid Western as \"formulating a chilling, savage frontier poetry to justify its hallucinated agenda\"; ultimately, he says, the acid Western expresses a counterculture sensibility to critique and replace capitalism with alternative forms of exchange.[3]\\nThe Australian Western genre or meat pie Western is set in Australia, especially the Australian Outback or the Australian Bush.[4] The genre borrows from US traditions.\\nThe Tracker is an archetype in this form of Australian Western, with signature scenes of harsh desert environments, and exploration of the themes of rough justice, exploitation of the Aboriginals, and the thirst for justice at all costs. Others in this category include Rangle River (1936), Kangaroo, The Kangaroo Kid (1950),The Sundowners (1960), Quigley Down Under (1990),  Ned Kelly (1970), The Man from Snowy River (1982), The Proposition, Lucky Country, and Sweet Country.[5]\\nMystery Road is an example of a modern Australian Western, and Mad Max has inspired many futurist dystopian examples of the Australian Western such as The Rover.\\nMany blaxploitation films, particularly ones involving Fred Williamson, have incorporated a Western setting within them. They are often characterized by excessive violence, stilted dialalog, and macho heroes. Examples include Soul Soldier (1970), Buck and the Preacher (1972), The Legend of Nigger Charley (1972), The Soul of Nigger Charley (1973), Thomasine & Bushrod (1974), Boss Nigger (1975), Adiós Amigo (1975), and Posse (1993).[6][7]\\nCharro Westerns, often featuring musical stars, as well as action, have been a standard feature of Mexican cinema since the 1930s. In the 1930s and 1940s, these were typically films about horsemen in rural Mexican society, displaying a set of cultural concerns very different from the Hollywood metanarrative, but the overlap between \"charro\" movies and Westerns became more apparent in the 1950s, \\'60s, and \\'70s. Some examples are Ismael Rodríguez\\'s Los Hermanos del Hierro (1961), Jorge Fons\\'s Cinco Mil Dólares de Recompensa, and Arturo Ripstein\\'s Tiempo de morir. The most important is Alberto Mariscal, great author of El tunco Maclovio, Todo por nada, Los marcados, El juez de la soga, and La chamuscada.[8][9]\\nThe Western is a popular genre in the Asian film industry.[10]:\\u200a1\\u200a Examples of the Chinese Western genre include Millionaires Express (1986), Let the Bullets Fly (2010) and Once Upon a Time in China and America (1997).\\nThis subgenre is imitative in style to mock, comment on, or trivialize the Western genre\\'s established traits, subjects, auteurs\\' styles, or some other target by means of humorous, satiric, or ironic imitation or parody. A prime example of comedy Western includes The Paleface (1948), which makes a satirical effort to \"send up Owen Wister\\'s novel The Virginian and all the cliches of the Western from the fearless hero to the final shootout on Main Street\".  The Paleface \"features a cowardly hero known as \"Painless\" Peter Potter (Bob Hope), an inept dentist, who often entertains the notion that he is a crack sharpshooter and accomplished Indian fighter\".[11]\\nOther examples include:\\nContemporary Western (or neo-Westerns or urban Westerns) have contemporary settings and use Old West themes, archetypes, and motifs, such as a rebellious antihero, open plains and desert landscapes, or gunfights.  This also includes the post-Western, with modern settings and \"the cowboy cult\" that involve the audience\\'s feelings and understanding of Western movies.[13] This subgenre often features Old West-type characters struggling with displacement in a \"civilized\" world that rejects their outdated brand of justice.  Some contemporary Westerns take place in the American West and reveal the progression of the Old West mentality into the late 20th and early 21st centuries; but the genre is not limited to the traditional American West setting. Coogan\\'s Bluff and Midnight Cowboy are examples of urban Westerns set in New York City.[13]:\\u200a148–149\\u200a\\nTypical themes of the neo-Western are the lack of rules, with morals guided by the character\\'s or audience\\'s instincts of right and wrong rather than by governance, characters searching for justice, and characters feeling remorse, connecting the neo-Western to the broader Western genre.[14] Other conventions of the genre include displays of competence, which in turn is measured in acts of violence.[15]\\nBeginning in the postwar era, radio dramas such as Tales of the Texas Rangers (1950–1952), with Joel McCrea, a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featured many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.[16]  In this period, post-Western precursors to the modern neo-Western films began to appear, such as Nicholas Ray\\'s The Lusty Men (1952) and John Sturges\\'s Bad Day at Black Rock (1955).[17]:\\u200a56\\u200a Examples of the modern \"first phase\" of neo-Westerns include films such as Lonely Are the Brave (1962) and Hud (1963).[17]:\\u200a324\\u200a  The popularity of the subgenre has been resurgent since the release of Joel and Ethan Coen\\'s No Country for Old Men (2007).[14]\\nThe neo-Western subgenre can also be seen in modern American television shows such as Breaking Bad, [18] Justified,[19] and Yellowstone.[20]\\nThe Bollywood film Sholay (1975) was often referred to as a \"curry Western\".[21] A more accurate genre label for the film is the \"dacoit Western\", as it combines the conventions of Indian dacoit films such as Mother India (1957) and Gunga Jumna (1961) with those of spaghetti Westerns. Sholay spawned its own genre of \"dacoit Western\" films in Bollywood during the 1970s.[22]\\nThe first Western films made in India – Kalam Vellum (1970, Tamil), Mosagallaku Mosagadu (1971, Telugu), Ganga (1972, Tamil), and Jakkamma (1972, Tamil) – were based on classic Westerns. Thazhvaram (1990), the Malayalam film directed by Bharathan and written by noted writer M. T. Vasudevan Nair, perhaps most resembles the spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as Adima Changala (1971) starring Prem Nazir, a hugely popular zapata spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and Sholay (1975) Khote Sikkay (1973) and Thai Meethu Sathiyam (1978) are notable curry Westerns. Kodama Simham (1990), a Telugu action film, starring Chiranjeevi and Mohan Babu, was one more addition to the Indo Western genre that fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as Hunters of the Indian Treasure.[23]\\nTakkari Donga (2002), starring Telugu actor Mahesh Babu, was applauded by critics, but was average at box office. Quick Gun Murugun (2009), an Indian comedy film that spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promotions at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.[24] Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Jaishankar, was made in Tamil. Laal Kaptaan (2019) is an IndoWestern starring Saif Ali Khan, which is set during the rise of the British Empire in India.\\nThe documentary Western is a subgenre of Westerns that explore the nonfiction elements of the historical and contemporary American West.  Between 1894 and 1899, Edison\\'s early use of film included several examples of documentaries that introduced Western characters and settings.  Among them were Parade of Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West Show.  His work showcased Native American ceremonial dance films such as Eagle Dance and Indian Day School, working cowboys in Branding Cattle, and scenic attractions such as Royal Gorge and Coaches Going to Cinnabar from Yellowstone Park.[25]\\nKen Burns\\'s The West is an example of a series based upon a historical storyline, whereas films such as Cowboys: A Documentary Portrait provide a nonfiction portrayal of modern working cowboys in the contemporary West.\\nThe 1971 film Zachariah starring John Rubinstein, Don Johnson, and Pat Quinn, was billed as the \"first electric Western\".[26] The film featured multiple performing rock bands in an otherwise American West setting.[26]\\nZachariah featured appearances and music supplied by rock groups from the 1970s, including the James Gang[26] and Country Joe and the Fish as \"The Cracker Band\".[26] Fiddler Doug Kershaw had a musical cameo[26] as does Elvin Jones as a gunslinging drummer named Job Cain.[26]\\nThe independent film Hate Horses starring Dominique Swain, Ron Thompson, and Paul Dooley billed itself as the \"second electric Western\".[27]\\nThe epic Western is a subgenre of the Western that emphasizes the story of the American Old West on a grand scale.[28]:\\u200a124\\u200a Many epic Westerns are set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone\\'s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), set during the American Civil War,[29]:\\u200a193\\u200a or Sam Peckinpah\\'s The Wild Bunch (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution.[30] One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone\\'s Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while using wide-scale shots of Monument Valley locations against a broad running-time.[31][29]:\\u200a195\\u200a\\nIn the silent film era, The Covered Wagon (1923) with J. Warren Kerrigan, was the first epic Western filmed entirely on location.[29]:\\u200a76\\u200a Another silent epic was The Iron Horse (1924) with George O\\'Brien.[28]:\\u200a136\\u200a\\nOther notable examples include Duel in the Sun (1946)[28]:\\u200a127\\u200a with Joseph Cotten and Gregory Peck, The Searchers (1956) with John Wayne, Giant (1956) with Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean, The Big Country (1958) with Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston, Cimarron (1960) with Glenn Ford, How the West Was Won (1962) with James Stewart and Henry Fonda (among many others), Custer of the West (1967) with Robert Shaw, Duck, You Sucker! (1971) with Rod Steiger and James Coburn, Heaven\\'s Gate (1980) with Isabelle Huppert, Dances with Wolves (1990) with Kevin Costner, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) with Brad Pitt, Django Unchained (2012) with Jamie Foxx, The Revenant (2015) with Leonardo DiCaprio, and Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1 (2024).\\nEuro-Westerns are Western-genre films made in Western Europe. The term can sometimes include the spaghetti Western subgenre. One example of a Euro-Western is the Anglo-Spanish film The Savage Guns (1961). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed sauerkraut Westerns[32] because they were made in Germany and shot in Yugoslavia, were derived from stories by novelist Karl May, and were film adaptations of May\\'s work. One of the most popular German Western franchises was the Winnetou series, which featured a Native American Apache hero in the lead role. Also in Finland, only a few Western films have been made, the most notable of which could be the 1971 low-budget comedy The Unhanged, directed by, written by, and starring Spede Pasanen.\\nSome new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including Kristian Levring\\'s The Salvation, Martin Koolhoven\\'s Brimstone, and Andreas Prochaska\\'s The Dark Valley.\\nExploitation Western is a subgenre of the Exploitation film, a genre characterized by \"exploiting\" lurid and graphic content throughout 1960s and 1970s up to the early 1980s. Examples of exploitation Western films include Soldier Blue (1970), Cain\\'s Cutthroats (1971), Cut-Throats Nine (1972) and Kid Vengeance (1977).\\nFantasy Westerns mixed in fantasy settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are Stephen King\\'s The Stand and The Dark Tower series of novels, the Vertigo comics series Preacher, and Keiichi Sigsawa\\'s light novel series, Kino\\'s Journey, illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi.\\nFlorida Westerns, also known as cracker Westerns, are set in Florida during the Second Seminole War. An example is Distant Drums (1951) starring Gary Cooper.\\nGaucho Westerns are films set in the 18th century in South America\\'s pampas following stories of gauchos, cowhands and swashbucklers getting into adventures akin to the cowboys portrayed in American movies of the era. Notable examples of gaucho Westerns include Nobleza gaucha (1915), The Gaucho (1927), The Gaucho War (1942), Way of a Gaucho (1952), Savage Pampas (1966), Don Segundo Sombra (1969), The Ardor (2014) and The Settlers (2023). An example of a gaucho neo-Western would be The Ones From Below (2023).[33]\\nAccording to the naming conventions after spaghetti Western, in Greece they are also referred to as \"fasolada Westerns\" (Greek: φασολάδα = bean soup, i.e. one of the national dishes of Greece). Notable examples are Blood on the Land (1966), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film,[34] and Bullets don\\'t come back (1967).[35][36]\\nThe horror Western subgenre has roots in films such as Curse of the Undead (1959), Jesse James Meets Frankenstein\\'s Daughter (1965), and Billy the Kid vs. Dracula (1966), which depicts the legendary outlaw Billy the Kid fighting against the notorious vampire. Another example is The Ghoul Goes West, an unproduced Ed Wood film to star Bela Lugosi as Dracula in the Old West.[37]  Newer examples include the films Near Dark (1987) directed by Kathryn Bigelow, which tells the story about a human falling in love with a vampire, From Dusk till Dawn (1996) by Robert Rodriguez deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, Vampires (1998) by John Carpenter, which tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, Ravenous (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; The Burrowers (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012). Undead Nightmare (2010), an expansion to Red Dead Redemption (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a zombie outbreak in the Old West. Bone Tomahawk (2015) received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism, but like many other movies in the genre, it was not a commercial success. Jordan Peele\\'s film Nope (2022) combines horror and science fiction with a neo-Western lens. It depicts two rancher siblings attempting to capture evidence of a UFO terrorizing their remote desert ranch.\\nA generic term for a Western which is combined with another genre such as horror, film noir or martial arts.[38] Dynamite Warrior is a martial arts fantasy Western set in Thailand.\\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., Billy Jack (1971) and its sequel The Trial of Billy Jack (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the Kung Fu TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson collaboration Shanghai Noon (2000). Further subdivisions of this subgenre include Westerns based on ninjas and samurais (incorporating samurai cinema themes), such as Red Sun (1971) with Charles Bronson, Alain Delon, and Toshiro Mifune.\\nThere have been many musical films with a Western setting and many musicians have appeared in Western films, sometimes in non-musical roles. Singers Doris Day and Howard Keel worked together in Calamity Jane, a huge success on release which remains one of the most popular Western musicals. On the other hand, crooner Dean Martin and pop singer Ricky Nelson played the parts of gunfighters in Rio Bravo, which is not a musical, although they did combine to sing a couple of songs in the middle of the film while they were guarding the jailhouse.[39]\\nA subgenre that highlights Mexican narcoculture and portrays drug trafficking and traffickers (real or imagined).[40] Narco Westerns are typically set in Northern Mexico, the Southwest United States, or on the border between the two.[41] A relatively new genre, Hilario Peña states the narco Western is the Western for the \"modern age,\" and that \"instead of a horse, the character drives a truck, and instead of fighting Apaches, the character must defeat criminals and the federal police in the state of Sinaloa.\"[42][43] Examples of narco Westerns include the American television shows Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, as well as the films Miss Bala, El Infierno and Heli.[44][41] They may also come in the form of literature or telenovelas. Narco Westerns often feature narratives of personal identity, usually the struggles of a cowboy-like anti-hero, while focusing on themes of life and death, love and loss, greed and desire, and hope and pain. Dry or dark humor is sometimes used. Most notably, Narco Westerns frequently showcase graphic portrayals of addiction, violence, and narcoterrorism.[45][41]\\nThe Northern genre is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in Alaska or Western Canada. Examples include several versions of the Rex Beach novel, The Spoilers (including 1930\\'s The Spoilers, with Gary Cooper, and 1942\\'s The Spoilers, with Marlene Dietrich, Randolph Scott, and Wayne); The Far Country (1954) with James Stewart; North to Alaska (1960) with Wayne;  Death Hunt (1981) with Charles Bronson; and The Grey Fox (1983) with Richard Farnsworth.\\nOstern films were Western-style films produced in the Soviet Union and Socialist Eastern Europe. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of Joseph Stalin. Osterns are typically divided between \"Easterns\", which sought to portray an Eastern European analogue to the Wild West set in frontier regions across Eurasia, and \"Red Westerns\", which were set in the American West but sought to subvert the ideas of manifest destiny and other narratives typical of Hollywood Westerns in favor of Marxist ideals of proletarian internationalism and class consciousness.\\nRed Western films usually portrayed the American Indians sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed them as villains. Osterns frequently featured Gypsy or Turkic people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Native Americans in Eastern Europe.\\nGojko Mitic portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian chiefs (e.g., in Die Söhne der großen Bärin (1966), directed by Josef Mach). He became honorary chief of the Sioux tribe when he visited the United States, in the 1990s, and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe of one of his films. American actor and singer Dean Reed, an expatriate who lived in East Germany, also starred in several Ostern films.\\n\"Eastern\" films typically replaced the Wild West setting with by an Eastern setting in the steppes of the Caucasus. Western stock characters, such as \"cowboys and Indians\", were also replaced by Caucasian stock characters, such as bandits and harems. A famous example of the genre was White Sun of the Desert, which was popular in the Soviet Union.[46]\\nPornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are Russ Meyer\\'s nudie-cutie Wild Gals of the Naked West (1962), and the hardcore A Dirty Western (1975) and Sweet Savage (1979). Sweet Savage starred Aldo Ray, a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, Custer\\'s Revenge (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the worst video games of all time.\\nFilm critic Philip French includes a subgenre of \"pre-Western\" to describe films that include themes and characters reminiscent of cowboy pictures but are not strictly regarded as Westerns.  This includes films with an early nineteenth century frontier setting with characters like James Fenimore Cooper\\'s Natty Bumppo. It includes examples like The Alamo (1960).[47]\\nFirst used in the publicity of the film Tampopo, the term \"ramen Western\" also is a play on words using a national dish. The term is used to describe Western style media set in Asia. Examples include The Drifting Avenger, Break the Chain, Millionaires Express, East Meets West, Tears of the Black Tiger and Dynamite Warrior, Let the Bullets Fly, Unforgiven, Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts, Buffalo Boys, The Good, the Bad and the Weird, Golden Kamuy and Sukiyaki Western Django.[48]\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Western was reinvented with the revisionist Western.[49] After the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make revisionist Westerns that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one\\'s character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah\\'s The Wild Bunch (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of Native Americans, who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include Ride the High Country (1962), Richard Harris\\' A Man Called Horse (1970), Little Big Man (1970), Soldier Blue (1970), Man in the Wilderness (1971), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Dances with Wolves (1990), Unforgiven (1992), The Quick and the Dead (1995), and Dead Man (1995). A television miniseries, Godless (2016), also fits into this category. A few earlier revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as Westward the Women (1951) starring Robert Taylor.  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, The Last Wagon (1956). In it, Richard Widmark played a white man raised by Comanches and persecuted by Whites, with Felicia Farr and Susan Kohner playing young women forced into leadership roles.\\nThe science fiction Western places science fiction elements within a traditional Western setting.[50]  Early examples are serial films such The Phantom Empire (1935) and Ghost Patrol (1936) which incorporated supernatural figures of science fiction fantasy into a Western setting.[50]  An example of cross-over genre, the fantasy science fiction Western The Valley of Gwangi (1969) displayed cowboys fighting dinosaurs, a trend that took hold during the 1960s. John Jakes\\'s Six Gun Planet takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...). The movie Westworld (1973) and its sequel Futureworld (1976), Back to the Future Part III (1990), Wild Wild West (1999), and Cowboys & Aliens (2011), and the television series Westworld (2016, based on the movie).\\nThis subgenre also encompasses the post-apocalyptic Western, an offshoot of the Western genre with themes of lawlessness and survival, and often include an alienated lone hero trying to make sense out of the chaos.[51]:\\u200a2\\u200a Examples include The Postman, the Mad Max series, and The Rover.[52][53][54] Science fiction Westerns may also incorporate steampunk elements, giving rise to the steampunk Western.[55]\\nA singing cowboy was a subtype of the archetypal cowboy hero of early Western films.[56][57] It references real-world campfire side ballads in the American frontier, the original cowboys sang of life on the trail with all the challenges, hardships, and dangers encountered while pushing cattle for miles up the trails and across the prairies.[58]\\nThe space Western is a subgenre of science fiction which uses the themes and tropes of Westerns within science-fiction stories.[50] Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in deep space, while more overt influences may feature literal cowboys in outer space who use ray guns and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American cartoon series BraveStarr (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988), the Japanese manga series Trigun (debuted in 1995), the Japanese anime series Cowboy Bebop (debuted in 1997), the American television series Firefly (created by Joss Whedon in 2002), and the films Battle Beyond the Stars (1980), which is a remake of The Magnificent Seven; Outland (1981), which is a remake of High Noon; and Serenity (2005, based on the Firefly TV series). The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science-fiction films such as the original Star Wars movie of 1977, with 2018\\'s Solo: A Star Wars Story and 2019\\'s The Mandalorian more directly featuring Western tropes. Gene Roddenberry\\'s concept of the TV show Star Trek was a \"Wagon Train to the stars\".[59]\\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in Italy with the \"spaghetti Westerns\", also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, the third film of the Dollars Trilogy.  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert region of Almería) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs, as well as their similarity to landscapes of the Southwestern United States. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.[60] Some spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered revisionist Westerns. For example, the Dollars Trilogy itself has much different tropes compared to standard Westerns, demythologizing the Sheriff figure (in A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More), putting both the Union and the Confederacy in ambiguously moral positions (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), and not featuring Native Americans (except for a brief mention in A Fistful of Dollars).\\nThe Western films directed by Sergio Leone were felt by some to have a different tone from the Hollywood Westerns.[61] Veteran American actors Charles Bronson, Lee Van Cleef, and Clint Eastwood[61] became famous by starring in spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as James Coburn, Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger, Klaus Kinski, Jason Robards, Gian Maria Volonte and Eli Wallach. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series Rawhide, unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone\\'s A Fistful of Dollars (the first in the Dollars Trilogy).[61]\\nThe weird Western combines elements of the classic Western with those of other genres, particularly fantasy, horror and science fiction.[62] This subgenre includes the steampunk Western subvariant, which incorporates the retrofuturistic elements of steampunk.[63] The Wild Wild West television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with steampunk.[64] The Jonah Hex franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film Western Religion (2015), by writer and director James O\\'Brien, introduces the devil into a traditional Wild West setting. The Old Man Logan (2008–2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post apocalyptic fiction with Westerns.\\n',\n",
       "  'The term Florida Western is used to describe a small number of films and literary works set in the 19th century, particularly around the time of the Second Seminole War. Not a significant number of these films have been made, as most Hollywood and other genre Westerns are usually located in other regions of the United States, particularly the former frontier territories of \"the West\".\\nA series of novels about Florida in the 19th century and their Florida cracker characters have been called cracker Westerns.[1][2]\\nIn 1895 Frederic Remington and Owen Wister traveled to Florida to write a story on Florida\\'s cowboys for Harper\\'s Weekly.[3]\\nIn the 1990s a series of cracker Westerns by several authors were published.[4]\\nRough Edges Press published Palmetto Empire by David Hardy in 2014. This novel follows the fictional adventures of backwoodsmen, outlaws, and rebels in the era of the First Seminole War.\\nIt was during the 1950s that most of these films were produced and many included a fictional and stereotypical portrayal of the real life Seminole leader, Osceola, who resisted American expansion into Florida during the late 1830s.  The film Distant Drums (1951), which was one of the earliest Florida Westerns made, even changed his name to Oscala and portrayed him as a malevolent savage, filled with a constant bloodlust who fed living prisoners to alligators.\\nOne of the advantages of these types of films, however, was that the producers often used the Florida Everglades as a backdrop. Now a contemporary audience has the benefit of glimpsing this wilderness in its mid-20th century form. The producers of Distant Drums even used the historic Castillo de San Marcos fort as a backdrop for the story. It was depicted as a fictitious stronghold for Spanish gunrunners selling armaments to the Seminole on the west coast of Florida, although it is actually located on the east coast.\\nFilms which were made and could be considered Florida Westerns include:\\n',\n",
       "  'Gothic Western (sometimes referred to as Western Gothic and Gothic prairie) is a subculture, artistically similar to gothic Americana, but blends goth and Western lifestyles that are notably visible in fashion, music, film and literature.\\n The post-war consciousness between 1940 and 1950 left consumers wanting less monster-related horror in favor of dark storytelling connected with reality. In other words, the monster, subject to relativism, survives in the shadows of the idealized American Dream.[1] Westerns were at their peak of popularity, but with the increase of technology, modernization and social changes, not without artistic commentary. An amalgamation of the two genres befitting this reflection was imminent.\\nIn 1971, Johnny Cash introduced the \"Man in Black\",[2] stating:\"I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, livin\\' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, but is there because he\\'s a victim of the times.\"[3]Larry Vincent, a horror host named Sinister Seymour, established Knott\\'s Halloween Haunt in 1973, one of the first Halloween related events on a large scale, blending Gothic and Western aesthetics at Calico ghost town, and providing a first venue for the growing subculture.[4]\\nIn literature,[5] the stereotype of the heroic cowboy gives way to a more complex antihero who has experienced trauma or is overcoming personal tragedy, and often associated to the darker side of Weird West monsters and villainy.[6] The novel The Hawkline Monster: A Gothic Western by Richard Brautigan was one of the first to incorporate the term in its title,[7] while Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy and The Dark Tower by Stephen King are also popular examples of the genre. The young adult series, The Goodbye Family by Lorin Morgan-Richards, has been considered Gothic Western with an element of humor.[8]\\n The mixture of goth and Western music has brooding and dark motifs interwoven into cowboy culture while incorporating themes of death, occult and superstition.[9] Crossover elements are seen in gothic country, but are unique to experiences of the American frontier, including Northern Mexico. The music encompasses storytelling and the cultural diversity of instrumentation associated with the American frontier.[10] The spaghetti Western sound of Ennio Morricone is influential to the genre.[11] Tom Waits, Johnny Cash, Steve Earle, The Handsome Family and Richard Marx have written Gothic Western songs.[12]\\nFilmmaker John Carpenter spoke of the unique quality of the genre, noting it is not the same as a Western horror.[13] In television, Penny Dreadful season three is considered an example of gothic Western, with vampires invading the West.[14] And God Said to Cain,[15] True History of the Kelly Gang[16]  and The Power of the Dog[17] have also been referenced as being Gothic Westerns.\\nSeveral games have been promoted as Gothic Western, including Darkwatch, West of Dead, Hunt: Showdown, and Evil West.\\nGothic Western fashion is a mix of Western wear with goth or Victorian era mourning attire, incorporating black and leather elements.[18]\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe horror Western is a crossgenre of both the horror and Western genres. It has it roots in films such as Curse of the Undead (1959), featuring Michael Pate as a vampire gunfighter; and Billy the Kid vs. Dracula (1966), which depicts the real-life outlaw Billy the Kid fighting against the fictional vampire Dracula.[1]\\nNewer examples include Near Dark (1987) directed by Kathryn Bigelow, which tells the story about a human falling in love with a vampire.[1] From Dusk till Dawn (1996) by Robert Rodriguez deals with outlaws battling vampires. Vampires (1998), by John Carpenter, is about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the Old West. Ravenous (1999) concerns cannibalism at a remote United States Army outpost and The Burrowers (2008) is about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012) depicts Abraham Lincoln's life as a secret vampire hunter.[2] Bone Tomahawk (2015), one of the most recent entries in the genre, received wide critical acclaim for its tale of cannibalism, but like many other films in the genre, it was not a commercial success.[3][4]\\nAmong games which combine the two genres, Deadlands is an alternate history role-playing game.[5] Darkwatch (2005); Undead Nightmare (2010), an expansion to Red Dead Redemption (2010) is an example of a video game in the genre, telling the tale of a zombie outbreak in the Old West.[6]\\n\",\n",
       "  'The Northern or Northwestern is a genre in various arts that tell stories set primarily in the late 19th or early 20th century in the north of North America, primarily in western Canada but also in Alaska. It is similar to the Western genre, but many elements are different, as appropriate to its setting. It is common for the central character to be a Mountie instead of a cowboy or sheriff. Other common characters include fur trappers and traders, lumberjacks, prospectors, First Nations people, outlaws, settlers, and townsfolk.\\nInternational interest in the region and the genre was fuelled by the Klondike Gold Rush (1896–99) and subsequent works surrounding it, fiction and non-fiction. The genre was extremely popular in the interwar period of the 20th century. Northerns are still produced, but their popularity waned in the late 1950s.\\nNortherns are similar to Westerns but are set in the frozen north of North America; that is, Canada or Alaska.[1]  Of the two, Canada was the more common setting, although many tropes could apply to both.  Popular locations within Canada are the Yukon, the Barren Grounds, and area around Hudson Bay.[2]  Generic names used for this general setting included the \"Far North\", the \"Northlands\", the \"North Woods\", and the \"Great Woods\".\\nCommon settings include boreal forests, isolated cabins, and mining towns.[3] Snow featured to such an extent that Northern films were sometimes termed \"snow pictures\".[3]  Animals were a common feature too.  Dogs and dog sleds were popularized by The Call of the Wild and White Fang.  Scenes involving attacks by bears date back to The Klondyke Nugget.[3]\\nThe primary antagonist in a Northern can be the wilderness, the weather and other natural elements, which the protagonists must endure, overcome and survive.[4][5]\\nNortherns often explore the \\'Matter of Canada\\' (the national mythos of Canada, after the Matter of Rome).[6]  Common elements of which are the Black Donnelly murders (February 1880), the North-West Rebellion (1885), the Klondike Gold Rush (1896–99), the pursuit of Albert Johnson (January 1932), the October Crisis (October 1970), and persistent national anxiety about potential annexation by the United States.[6]\\nThe Western idea of lawlessness set in American towns was not a part of the Canadian Northern, though individual lawbreakers or uprisings by Canadians feature in works such as Quebec (1951), Riel (1979), and Northwest Mounted Police (1940).  In Northerns and wider crime fiction, the general Canadian preference is for law enforcement to be performed by the state rather than vigilantes or private investigators.[6]  Likewise, Northerns rarely feature the heroic outlaws often found in Westerns.[6]  On the subject, David Skene-Melvin writes \"Canada never had a Wild West because the Mounties got there first,\"[6] while Margaret Atwood writes \"No outlaws or lawless men for Canada; if one appears, the Mounties always get their man.\"[7]\\nLaw and order in Northerns set in Canada is most often represented by the Mounties, either the North-West Mounted Police or Royal Canadian Mounted Police depending on era.  Like snow, Mounties are a common enough feature to become a synonym for the genre, with Northern films sometimes called \"Mountie films\".[8]  Their popularity was not confined to film; by 1930, 75 volumes of written Mountie fiction had been published, not including juvenile fiction and material published in magazines.[5] Where a protagonist in a Western is often part of both civilization and the wild (whether native or criminal), Mounties in Northerns are entirely a part of civilization.[5]  The nature of fictional Mounties can vary depending on the nationality of the author.[5]  Mounties as written by British authors are often younger members of upper class British families serving the British Empire in the colonies.  American-authored Mounties are often little different from US Marshalls and project the values of Westerns in that they place their individual sense of justice and conscience above their duty to the law. Canadian-authored Mounties represent, and are self-abnegating champions of, the Canadian establishment and its laws.  Further, their authority does not come from either their social class or physical abilities; such a Mountie \"upholds the law by moral rather than physical force\".[5]  A common story outline for Northerns involving Mounties is a pursuit, confrontation and capture: the Mountie\\'s pursuit of a fugitive takes place across the Canadian wilderness and may be resolved non-violently.[5]\\nAccording to Pierre Berton \"the French-Canadian was to the northerns what the Mexican was to the Westerns — an exotic primitive, adaptable as a chameleon to play a hero or a heavy.\"[9] French-Canadians were a ubiquitous element of the genre.  As characters, French-Canadians are typically depicted as rustic and uneducated. These characters were usually divided into two broad types: the heroic, happy-go-lucky bon-vivant and the villainous, lecherous killer.  Some later examples merged the two stereotypes into a charming, roguish anti-villain.[9]  Common visual elements were a tuque, a sash and a pipe.[9]  All were present in the first appearance in film, in A Woman\\'s Way (1908).[9]  Female French-Canadian characters also followed the \"tempestuous\" stereotype of female Mexican characters.  Mexican actress Lupe Vélez, in line with her identity as \"The Mexican Spitfire\", played the title character in Tiger Rose (1929) in this mode; as did Renée Adorée in The Eternal Struggle (1923) and Nikki Duval in Quebec (1951).[9]\\nA common anachronism in Northerns was the tyranny and absolute power of the Hudson\\'s Bay Company and its officers, even into the modern period.[9]  This was repeated not just in fiction but by reviewers and critics too.[9]  The concept of La Longue Traverse, or the Journey of Death, comes from The Call of the North (1914) and was popular in later films.  In this, the Hudson\\'s Bay Company executes convicts by forcing them into the wilderness without equipment or supplies.[9]  In 1921, the Hudson\\'s Bay Company successfully sued the Famous Players–Lasky Corporation for the villainous portrayal of their Company in the latter\\'s remake The Call of the North.[9]\\nAlaska Natives or Métis are featured in some depictions.\\nBesides being set in Canadian Prairies, the stories often contrast the American frontier with the Canadian frontier in several ways.  In films such as Pony Soldier and Saskatchewan the North-West Mounted Police display reason, compassion and a sense of fair play in their dealings with Aboriginal people (First Nations) as opposed to hotheaded American visitors (often criminals), lawmen or the American Army who seem to prefer extermination with violence.\\nDavid Skene-Melvin classes the \"second period\" of Canadian crime literature (1880–1920), as \"the heyday of the \\'Northern\\' and the literary exploration of Canada\\'s remote and romantic frontiers.\"[6]  He refers to Joseph Edmund Collins as an important figure in this period because, despite his work being of low quality, he was the first Canadian author to address some aspects of the \\'Matter of Canada\\' in his novels, such as The Story of Louis Riel: The Rebel Chief (1885) and Annette, the Métis Spy (1886).[6]  Northerns continued to be written after 1920 but Canadian authors largely moved to other genres after World War I as they moved away from a frontier and colonial ethos.[6]\\nThe Klondike Gold Rush during the 1890s in Canada and Alaska brought a lot of wider, international attention to the far north of North America.[2]  Adventure novels from veterans of the gold rush—such as Jack London\\'s The Call of the Wild (1903), Rex Beach\\'s The Spoilers (1906) and Robert W. Service\\'s The Trail of Ninety-Eight (1909)—became best sellers.[2]  These inspired more adventure fiction which grew in popularity throughout the first half of the twentieth century.[2]  The genre was extremely popular in the inter-war years,[2][3] with a \"Mountie craze\" hitting its peak during the mid-1920s.[9]\\nA large amount of Northern fiction is the work of non-Canadians.  Nevertheless, Skene-Melvin writes \"Just as the Western is widely regarded as emblematic of American culture, it can be argued that the Northern is the only truly indigenous Canadian art form, even if most of its exponents have been foreigners.\"[6]\\nOne of the earliest international examples of the genre is the British play The Klondyke Nugget, which was first performed in 1898.[3]  Its author, Samuel Franklin Cody initially wrote it as a Western but changed the location to capitalize on the contemporary gold rush.[3]\\nCharlie Chaplin\\'s 1925 film The Gold Rush is a comedy that parodies some of the cliches of the Northern genre.[3] The Looney Tunes character Blacque Jacque Shellacque, who first appeared in the 1959 short Bonanza Bunny, is another parody.[4]\\nWhile the Hollywood Western began to change in the post-World War II era and the Western myth eventually lost popularity, Hollywood Northerns remained mostly unchanged until their production waned in the late 1950s, the underlying mythology never being challenged.[9]\\n',\n",
       "  'The Ostern (\"Eastern\"; Russian: истерн, romanized:\\xa0Istern; or остерн) is a film genre created in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc as a variation of the Western films. The word Ostern is a portmanteau derived from the German word Ost, meaning \"East\", and the English word western. Two subgenres may be distinguished (although the terms may be used interchangeably):\\nAmerican Westerns were amongst the US films imported into the early Soviet Union.[1] As a result, certain Soviet films at the time are seen to incorporate Western elements. For example, the image of the Western cowboy is used to symbolize the United States and the West as a whole in the Soviet silent comedy The Extraordinary Adventures of Mr. West in the Land of the Bolsheviks (1924). Red Devils is a revolutionary action film that also borrows from the Western genre. As cultural restrictions tightened during the Stalinist era, however, Western-inspired films in the Soviet Union became few and far between. It is worth noting, however, that Stalin was an avid enjoyer of Hollywood Western films, and is argued by some to have desired the Western genre within the Soviet Union.[2]\\n1957\\'s Miles of Fire is one of the earliest examples of a Soviet Western as it was released years before the Ostern genre became formalized and prevalent. The Western genre saw a resurgence in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, largely resulting from the Khrushchev Thaw. In 1962, the USSR allowed for the screening of certain US and foreign films. The Magnificent Seven, an American Western starring Steve McQueen, become the most successful of these films commercially, becoming an instant cult classic amongst Soviet moviegoers.[3] The overwhelming popularity and commercial demand of films like The Magnificent Seven enticed Soviet filmmakers and state-run film institutions to experiment with Western elements in their own productions, resulting in the creation of the Soviet Western.[4]\\nThe Czechoslovakian comedy Lemonade Joe or the Horse Opera (1964) gained popularity amongst Soviet citizens and those in the Eastern Bloc.[5] Though the film is largely a parody of the Western genre, its commercial success nonetheless furthered the familiarity of Western tropes within the Eastern Bloc and the general Soviet audience.\\nKarl May\\'s Treasure of the Silver Lake, West Germany, co-production with Yugoslavia, was seminal for the beginning of the era of German Red Westerns. The film prompted a highly successful series of Indianerfilme (\"Indian Films\") about Winnetou and others, produced by the East German DEFA studios.[6] The East German The Sons of the Great Bear (1966) was a seminal Red Western that turned the traditional American \"Cowboy and Indian\" conventions on their head, casting the Native Americans as the heroes and the American Army as the villains, a motif inspired by  highly successful German Osterns.  These films were immensely popular among the East German audience, furthering the widespread German fascination of Native American culture[7] (see Native American Hobbyism in Germany).\\nA considerable strain into the genre was added by Romanian cinematographers, which included adaptations of Fenimore Cooper stories, with many of them being co-productions with Western directors.[6]\\nWhite Sun of the Desert (1970) stands out as the quintessential Ostern, with its release considered by some to usher in the \"golden era\" of Soviet Western film.[8] Set in rural Turkmenistan, the film incorporates many elemental Western characteristics, namely wide shots of empty skies and nature, transportation via horse and leather saddle, and the lone stoic protagonist. The film quickly obtained a cult-like status, with multiple catchphrases from the film making its way into casual conversation.[9]\\n\"Gibanica Western\" was a short-lived term for the Yugoslav equivalent of the Ostern, more commonly known as partisan film and, sometimes, the Partisan Western. They were made in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and were about the partisans in World War II. Gibanica is a traditional Balkan pastry, and the name of the genre is dubbed in an analogy with  \"spaghetti Western\".[10]\\nThe Goulash Westerns are the Easterns of Hungarian director György Szomjas. He directed two films (The Wind Blows Under Your Feet and Wrong-Doers) in the 1970s, shot in the Hortobágy National Park, the best approximation of wastelands he could find in the country.[11]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe revisionist Western, also called the anti-Western, is a sub-genre of the Western film.[1][2][3] Called a post-classical variation of the traditional Western, the revisionist subverts the myth and romance of the traditional by means of character development and realism to present a less simplistic view of life in the \"Old West\". While the traditional Western always embodies a clear boundary between good and evil, the revisionist Western does not.\\nRevisionist themes have existed since the early 20th century but it was not until 1968, when the Hays Code restrictions were relaxed, that revisionism finally supplanted the traditional. Although many earlier Westerns are labelled as revisionist, the distinction between them is often blurred by variable themes and plot devices. Some are labelled psychological Westerns, which is closely related to and sometimes overlaps with the psychological drama and psychological thriller genres because of their focus on character, at the expense of the action and thrills that predominate in the traditional. Other revisionist films, in which action and adventure remain prominent, are labelled Indian Westerns or outlaw/gunfighter Westerns because, instead of the traditional hero, the protagonist is a Native American, an outlaw, or a gunfighter. The spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s, not bound by the Hays Code, were strongly revisionist by presenting morally ambiguous stories featuring an anti-hero or a sympathetic villain. From 1969, revisionism has prevailed in Western film production.\\nThe traditional Western typically features a strong male lead character, often a lawman or cavalry officer, who takes direct action on behalf of supposedly civilized people against those deemed to be uncivilized (see also: Civilizing mission). The former are portrayed as honest townsfolk or travelers, and the latter as outlaws or hostile Native Americans.[4][5]\\nIn the revisionist Western, the traditional format and themes are subverted by such devices as the Native American protagonist; strong female characters; the outlaw protagonist; plots that are pre-eminently concerned with survival in a wild environment; or the presentation of a morally ambiguous storyline without definite heroes, these often featuring the so-called anti-hero or a sympathetic villain. The object is to blur the traditionally clear boundaries between \"right\" and \"wrong\" (the \"good guy\" against the \"bad guy\") by emphasizing the need for survival amidst ambiguity.[6][7]\\nThe traditional Western treats characters in simplistic terms as good or bad with minimal character development. The psychological Western, which began in the 1940s and was hugely popular through the 1950s and 1960s, prioritizes character development ahead of action whilst retaining most of the traditional aspects. For the most part, the psychological Western morphed into the revisionist Western as censorship restrictions were relaxed and removed in the 1960s.[8]\\nShane (1953), directed by George Stevens, is a psychological Western.[9][10] The title character (Alan Ladd) seems at first to be a traditional Western drifter riding across a traditional Western landscape but it is soon apparent that he has entered a complex setting which is populated by, as Kim Newman puts it, \"believable characters with mixed motives\".[11] Even though rancher Ryker (Emile Meyer) is ostensibly the villain of the piece, he makes the point that he has striven for thirty years to develop the cattle range which is now being taken over by fence-building \"sodbusters\", many of whom have the mixed motives noted by Newman.[12] Despite the complexity of its characters, Shane is nevertheless filmed in a conventional setting and ends with the hero outshooting and killing the three main villains. There is, however, an element of revisionism in the ending when the disillusioned Shane admits to Ryker that he knows his day as a gunfighter is over. Shane rides away to an uncertain future, possibly to die (he is wounded), and it is farmer Starrett (Van Heflin) and his family who endure.[13]\\nFifteen years after Stevens\\'s Shane, Sergio Leone directed Once Upon a Time in the West, a revisionist Western[14][15] which completely subverts the traditional with complex characters and multiple plot devices, the key one being revenge – the motive of enigmatic gunfighter Harmonica (Charles Bronson). As in Shane, it is not the gunfighters who \"inherit the West\" but in this case the compassionate town-building ex-prostitute Jill (Claudia Cardinale). By the end of the film, all of the antagonists except Harmonica are dead and, like Shane, he rides away to an uncertain future.[16]\\nOpinion is divided on the origin of the revisionist or psychological Western but it is generally agreed that there were hints of a darker perspective in some films of the 1930s such as Westward Ho (1935), directed by Robert N. Bradbury and starring John Wayne, in which the hero leads a band of vigilantes on a quest for revenge. Westward Ho is the earliest film in AllMovie\\'s list of revisionist Westerns.[17] The earliest films classified by AllMovie as psychological Westerns are The Ox-Bow Incident and The Outlaw (both 1943).[18]\\nThe Outlaw/Gunfighter sub-genre focused on outlaws and gunfighters as human beings rather than using them as stock characters, often dressed in black, as in traditional Westerns. The aim was to examine the impact of gunfights on the participants by revealing their neuroses and redeeming characteristics. AllMovie\\'s earliest films of this type are two silents: The Road Agent (1926), directed by J. P. McGowan and starring Al Hoxie; and Jesse James (1927), directed by Lloyd Ingraham and starring Fred Thomson.[19]\\nIn a similar vein, the Indian Western seeks to reverse negative stereotypes by sympathetic portrayal of Native Americans who, in the traditional Western, are nearly always the enemy of the \"heroic\" white settlers and cavalry. In the Indian Western, roles can be reversed with peaceful Native Americans driven to fight against white aggression. Usually, however, the Native American hero or heroine is played by brownface whites such as Burt Lancaster and Jean Peters in Apache (1954). In Dances With Wolves, the female lead was Mary McDonnell playing a white who had been raised by the Lakota.[20] There had been earlier films which portrayed Native Americans sympathetically, but the breakthrough for this sub-genre was Broken Arrow (1950), directed by Delmer Daves and starring James Stewart, with Jeff Chandler as Cochise. Kim Newman wrote that Chandler\\'s performance established Cochise as \"the 1950s model of an Indian hero\" and the film inspired goodwill to other Native American chiefs such as Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and Geronimo – as a result, \"it became fashionable for Westerns to be pro-Indian\".[21]\\nMany of the films were produced in the 1950s during the milieu of McCarthyism and attempted to strike back against blacklisting of the film industry at that time, notably High Noon (1952) starring Gary Cooper.[22] By the time of the loosening, and later abandonment, of the restrictive Hays Code in the 1960s, many directors of the New Hollywood generation such as Sam Peckinpah, George Roy Hill, and Robert Altman focused on the Western and each produced their own classics in the genre, including Peckinpah\\'s The Wild Bunch (1969), Hill\\'s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), and Altman\\'s McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971).[8]\\nMeanwhile, European directors such as Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci had been making Western films unencumbered by American expectations nor Hays Code inspired censorship, and these spaghetti Westerns also provided a new perspective on the Western genre. Early examples of this sub-genre are Leone\\'s A Fistful of Dollars, starring Clint Eastwood, and Corbucci\\'s Minnesota Clay, starring Cameron Mitchell, both made in 1964.[23]\\nThe revisionist and psychological Westerns have been carried forward from their own standard settings into the neo-Western, a notable of which is the Coen brothers\\' No Country for Old Men (2007), based on the work of Cormac McCarthy, an author known for writing revisionist Western literature, such as the novel Blood Meridian.[24]\\nEuropean countries, which had imported Western productions since their silent film inception, began creating their own versions and, in  1964, Sergio Leone\\'s A Fistful of Dollars became an international hit initiating the spaghetti Western filone.[25] Although they were mostly shot in Spanish locations, featured U.S. actors, and were co-produced by European and U.S. producers, many of the most successful directors were Italian, resulting in these films being known by the misnomer Spaghetti Western. Leone is often credited with initiating the growth of these co-produced European Westerns as he played a seminal role due to the financial success of A Fistful of Dollars. Scholars such as Austin Fisher have begun to pay attention to how in this popular genre Italian directors such as Damiano Damiani, Sergio Sollima and Sergio Corbucci, in responding to international and national events, chose the Western as a way to represent Leftist doctrine in the second half of the 1960s, interpreting the conflict between Mexico and the U.S. through the lens of Italian politics.[26] Leone popularized the morally ambivalent gunfighter through his representation of \"The Man with No Name,\" Clint Eastwood\\'s gritty anti-hero who was copied again and again in Spaghetti Westerns in characters such as Django and Ringo and which came to be one of its universal attributes.[27]\\nBeginning in the late 1960s, independent filmmakers produced revisionist and hallucinogenic films, later retroactively identified as the separate but related subgenre of \"acid Westerns,” that radically turn the usual trappings of the Western genre inside out to critique both capitalism and the counterculture.[28] Monte Hellman\\'s The Shooting and Ride in the Whirlwind (1966), Alejandro Jodorowsky\\'s El Topo (1970), Roland Klick\\'s Deadlock (1970),[29][30] Robert Downey Sr.\\'s Greaser\\'s Palace (1972), Alex Cox\\'s Walker (1987), and Jim Jarmusch\\'s Dead Man (1995) fall into this category.[31] Films made during the early 1970s are particularly noted for their hyper-realistic photography and production design.[32] Other films, such as those directed by Clint Eastwood, were made by professionals familiar with the Western as a criticism and expansion against and beyond the genre. Eastwood\\'s The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and Unforgiven (1992) made use of strong supporting roles for women and Native Americans.[33]\\nThis list is not exhaustive. It includes major films labelled revisionist Western, anti-Western, psychological Western, Indian Western, outlaw Western, gunfighter Western, or spaghetti Western. By 1970, revisionism had supplanted the traditional as the predominant Western sub-genre and so the list highlights the films released until then to illustrate the development of the concept.\\nSubsequently, revisionist themes have prevailed in Western film production. Major releases from 1971 to the present include:\\n',\n",
       "  'A science fiction Western is a subgenre or cross-genre that uses traditional Western plots and settings, while incorporating science fiction elements such as futuristic technology or aliens.[1][2]:\\u200a29\\u200a The post-apocalyptic Western and steampunk Western fall within this subgenre.[1]:\\u200a2\\u200a[3]\\nSince the characteristic elements of science fiction can occur in any setting, science fiction lends itself to combination with other genres.[4] In 1953, J. B. Priestley described the \"Western\" as one of the three types of science fiction.[5]\\nPrecursors of the science fiction Western are seen in 19th century inventor fiction such as The Steam Man of the Prairies (1868).\\nThe film serial The Phantom Empire has been cited as possibly the earliest science fiction Western. Set on a dude ranch and making use of props associated with conventional Westerns, it showcased futuristic technology not in existence during the period.[6] Since then, science fiction Westerns have appeared in film, television, novels, comic books, and other media.[6]\\nIn 1953, J. B. Priestley described the \"Western\" as one of the three types of science fiction.[5]  The separate genres of science fiction and Westerns use similar plot devices and character types, as well as common frontier settings and themes of survival, making the two genres well suited to be a blended subgenre.  The shared setting of the frontier is a contrast with the typical Western showing the frontier as something that can be tamed, but something that can never be fully crossed in science fiction.  Another shared theme is that force is often applied as a means of survival, leading to a type of hero that is often both savage and civilized at once.  Also typical of both genres is the theme of an economic motive for exploration or expansion.[7]\\nWhen combined, the science fiction Western focuses on traditional Western plots and frontier settings combined with science fiction elements, such as futuristic technology or aliens.[2]:\\u200a29\\u200a[8]:\\u200a1\\u200a This definition can be contrasted with the space Western, which, having its roots in science fiction, contains elements of the Western genre, but is generally in an outer space setting.[8]:\\u200a1\\u200a[9]\\nRelated cross-over genres include Western steampunk, which typically include Western settings and futuristic science fiction elements combined with steampunk aesthetics.[3] This may include cross-over with the Weird West genre.[1]  The post-apocalyptic Western falls within this subgenre, usually incorporating the lawlessness of the frontier, gangs of outlaws, and the survival of an alienated hero.[1]:\\u200a2\\u200a\\nThe precursors of science fiction Western began as early as the late 1800s with what became known as inventor fiction, with examples such as The Steam Man of the Prairies (1868).[8]:\\u200a6\\u200a\\nEarly serial films such The Phantom Empire (1935) and Ghost Patrol (1936) incorporated supernatural figures of science fiction fantasy into a Western setting.[2]:\\u200a29\\u200a By the post-World War II era, Westerns began to fall out of favor in the youth market as space fever began to take hold.[10]  The classic Western\\'s approach to gender, race, sexuality, and indigenous groups contributed to its decline until the hybrid Western revived it.[2]:\\u200a28\\u200a\\nDuring the 1960s, films such as Valley of the Gwangi (1969), which displayed cowboys fighting dinosaurs, took hold.

In one sense, it is considered a space Western with its outer space setting. However, its frontier realism qualifies it as a science fiction Western by others, including creator Joss Whedon, since it combined the visual elements associated with Westerns.  In either case, it ultimately pushed the boundaries of genres.[11] Whedon noted that the term made people \"cringe\".[12][13]\\nAlthough a box office flop, 2011\\'s Cowboys and Aliens paid homage to the genre with its successful integration of Western and science-fiction themes.[2]:\\u200a31\\u200a\\nLone Star Planet by John J. McGuire (1958) and Six-Gun Planet by John Jakes (1970) are examples of science fiction that pays particular attention to Western themes and are by writers not typically associated with the Western genre.  Each is an example that defines the contrast between science fiction and Western genres.  The frontier in science fiction is continuously expanding, while the Western frontier is limited and can be (or is) tamed.  Both Lone Star Planet and Six-Gun Planet take place within a closed frontier, emphasizing the Western part of this hybrid genre.[7]\\nIn a setting that shares the social characteristics of American Old West, Stephen King\\'s The Dark Tower series blends themes from multiple genres including science fiction Western complete with gunslinger protagonist Roland Deschain inspired by the Man with No Name.[14]\\nThe Buntline Special (2010) is the first book in a series by Mike Resnick that can be classified as weird Western or steampunk Western, a crossover genre of the science fiction Western.[15]\\nAnother example of the genre is The Ghosts of Watt O\\'Hugh by Steven S.

       "  'A singing cowboy was a subtype of the archetypal cowboy hero of early Western films. It references real-world campfire side ballads in the American frontier. The original cowboys sang of life on the trail with all the challenges, hardships, and dangers encountered while pushing cattle for miles up the trails and across the prairies. This continues with modern vaquero traditions and within the genre of Western music, and its related New Mexico, Red Dirt, Tejano, and Texas country music styles. A number of songs have been written and made famous by groups like the Sons of the Pioneers and Riders in the Sky and individual performers such as Marty Robbins, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Tex Ritter, Bob Baker and other \"singing cowboys\". Singing in the wrangler style, these entertainers have served to preserve the cowboy as a unique American hero.\\nThe image of the singing cowboy was established in 1925 when Carl T. Sprague of Texas recorded the cowboy song, \"When the Work\\'s All Done This Fall\". A year later, John I. White became the first representative of the genre to perform on a nationally broadcast radio show. Other early recording artists in the Western genre included Jules Verne Allen, Harry McClintock, Wilf Carter alias Montana Slim, and Tex Owens who wrote \"The Cattle Call\" which became a standard in the singing cowboy genre.\\nMany of these early recording artists had grown up on ranches and farms or had experience working as cowboys. They typically performed simple arrangements with rustic vocal performances and a simple guitar or fiddle accompaniment. The full popularity of the singing cowboys was not reached until the spread of sound films and the emergence of the commercial country music industry.\\nAs the singing cowboy genre developed it kept its themes of the American west and cowboy life, but moved away from its folk music origins to adapt to popular tastes. It was popularized by many of the B-movies of the 1930s and 1940s.[1] The typical singing cowboys were white-hat-wearing, clean-shaven heroes with the habit of showing their emotions in song. Singing cowboys typically recorded with big band arrangements, often in the western swing style popularized by Bob Wills, and were also influenced by the vocal style of crooners such as Bing Crosby. Crosby himself also made a single appearance as a singing cowboy in Rhythm on the Range (1936), including the song \"I\\'m an Old Cowhand (From the Rio Grande)\" which many other singing cowboys later performed.\\nKen Maynard was the screen\\'s first singing cowboy. He first appeared in silent motion pictures in 1923 and in addition to acting also did stunt work. His horsemanship and rugged good looks made Maynard a cowboy star. He recorded two songs with Columbia Records before making his first film with a musical soundtrack. He sang two songs in Sons of the Saddle (1930).[2]\\nIn 1930 Bob Steele began a series of singing cowboy films for Tiffany Pictures[3] though he later stopped singing in films.\\nEarly in his career, 27-year-old John Wayne appeared as \"Singin\\' Sandy Saunders\" in Riders of Destiny (1933) and also made seven more films for Monogram Pictures.[4] Wayne\\'s version of the singing cowboy was much darker than the later ones; his ten-gallon hat was black instead of white and he\\'d chant about \"streets running with blood\" and \"you\\'ll be drinking your drinks with the dead\" as he strode purposefully down the street toward a showdown.\\nThe films were successful and boosted Wayne\\'s career after several failures in the wake of the widescreen classic The Big Trail (1930), but he refused to renew his contract in 1935,[5] although he did continue making nonsinging Westerns for Monogram\\'s successor, Republic Pictures. Because Wayne could not sing, his filmed songs were dubbed by the son of director Robert N. Bradbury, making the obligatory personal appearances a continuous embarrassment for the young actor.[4][5] Wayne also emphasized authenticity in his Westerns and knew that real cowboys did not routinely sing on the way to a gunfight or wear Singin\\' Sandy\\'s elaborate costumes.[5]\\nWhile other Western actors, such as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, only dabbled in singing roles, some actors became known mainly for their parts as singing cowboys. The most famous of them was Gene Autry, and the moniker \"the singing cowboy\" usually refers to him in particular. When Wayne declined further singing cowboy roles, Republic looked for a replacement. Former rodeo rider Autry was chosen because he was the one candidate who could both sing and ride a horse[4].  The choice was so successful that, at the time of his death in 1998, Autry was still on the top 10 list of Hollywood Western box office moneymakers.[6]\\nAutry, initially a rodeo competitor, first rose to popularity as a singer, but his acting career started off quickly with the 1935 film serial The Phantom Empire, and he became a prolific star. Autry\\'s early popularity, both for his radio and film performances, quickly paved the way for a multitude of imitators, but most attempts didn\\'t get close to his success.\\nAutry, and later Roy Rogers, often appeared in contemporary Western settings rather than the 19th century wild west era. This allowed the stars to appear in modern clothing alongside motorcars, airplanes, and telephones. In The Phantom Empire, Autry spends time singing on the radio at his \"Radio Ranch\" as well as battling an ancient civilisation with a race of robots who live beneath the earth.\\nAutry was also the first sound motion picture cowboy star to use his own name as the main character in a film,[7] a practice soon emulated by Rogers (although \"Roy Rogers\" wasn\\'t his real name, either, it was Leonard Slye).\\nWarner Bros. began a series of twelve singing cowboy films featuring their contract star Dick Foran from 1935-1937. Foran\\'s first picture in this popular series was Moonlight on the Prairie, followed by Song of the Saddle. His style of singing was in a golden voiced manner reminiscent of Nelson Eddy.[8]\\nSykes \"Smith\" Ballew made a series of five films for producer Sol Lesser that were released through 20th Century Fox.\\nFred Leedon Scott made a series of films initially with Jed Buell\\'s Spectrum Pictures beginning with Romance rides the Range (1963).\\nBob Baker starred in a series of a dozen films for Universal Pictures from 1937. He later appeared as a second lead to Johnny Mack Brown from 1939.\\nAutry\\'s status as the top singing cowboy was never in question until 1937, when disagreements made him temporarily walk out on his contract with Republic Studios. The studio\\'s chosen replacement, Roy Rogers, who had previously appeared only in minor roles (including a memorable appearance opposite Autry while still billed under his real name, Leonard Slye), quickly grew popular when given the chance to star. By the time Autry returned, he found himself challenged for top movie singing cowboy status by the blossoming career of his new rival Rogers, although Rogers never neared Autry\\'s juggernaut level of record sales. When Autry enlisted in the Army Air Corps during World War II, Roy Rogers became the \"King of the Cowboys,\" competing head-to-head with Autry for the rest of the decade. Autry and Rogers (as a member of the \"Sons of the Pioneers\" singing group), had appeared together in the 1935 Autry vehicle, The Old Corral, Rogers\\' second film, before the studio chose him as an Autry replacement and renamed him during Autry\\'s walkout two years later. Autry and Rogers never made a movie together after Rogers began his solo film career, although Rogers did appear in a supporting role with ex-singing cowboy John Wayne in Dark Command (1940).\\nIn 1936, Edward Finney of the recently formed Grand National Pictures decided on a singing cowboy for their studio and screen-tested Tex Ritter, who began a series of films with the studio beginning with Song of the Gringo.[9] Ritter recorded \"Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darlin\\',\" the movie title-track song for High Noon (1952). The song became a hit and received an Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song, for 1953. Tex Ritter was also the father of television sitcom actor John Ritter.\\nHerb Jeffries made a series of films beginning with Harlem on the Prairie (1937).\\nSinging cowgirl Dorothy Page made three films for Grand National Pictures in 1939.\\nWith the fame of the operetta Rose-Marie and singing cowboy films, a series of films with actor singer James Newill playing a singing Mountie, Renfrew of the Royal Mounted, were released by Grand National between 1937 and 1940.\\nObserving the success of the singing cowboy at other studios, Monogram Pictures engaged Addison Randall for a series of Western films where he initially sang.\\nHaving a variety of experience in supporting roles in many Westerns, Producers Releasing Corporation gave Eddie Dean a series of films beginning with Song of Old Wyoming in 1945.[10]\\nKen Curtis, a member of the Sons of the Pioneers singing group, made a series of Westerns at Columbia Pictures accompanied by the Hoosier Hot Shots. A son in law of director John Ford, He appeared in numerous Ford films as a basically non-singing supporting player, including The Searchers, and later played \"Festus Hagen\" on the television series Gunsmoke for eleven seasons.\\nRex Allen made his debut in films with Republic Pictures\\' The Arizona Cowboy in 1950.  He is credited with making the last theatrical singing cowboy Western Phantom Stallion in 1954.[11]\\nPopular singer Vaughn Monroe filmed two Westerns for Republic Pictures, Singing Guns (1950) and Toughest Man in Arizona (1952) where he sang the hit song Mule Train in the former.\\nOther notable actors who became famous as singing cowboys were Jimmy Wakely and John \\'Dusty\\' King who appeared in the Range Busters series. Non-singing cowboy actors such as Buck Jones[12] complained that producers would find it too easy to pad out the length of a film with songs rather than action, characterization, or plot exposition.\\nWith the advent of television, the making of B-movies dropped off and the era of singing cowboys was coming to an end. Autry and Rogers went on to star in The Gene Autry Show and The Roy Rogers Show, respectively, but the series\\' runs ended by the close of the decade (1950s), and the singing cowboy gradually ceased to exist in popular culture except as an exercise in nostalgia. Though he did not appear in the film, Tex Ritter sang the continuing ballad of High Noon.\\nThe singing cowboy image has since been parodied, most notably in the 1985 film Rustlers\\' Rhapsody, with Tom Berenger portraying a stereotypical singing cowboy,[13] and in the Pixar film Toy Story 2.[14] The Coen brothers use singing cowboys in two films; Alden Ehrenreich portrays singing cowboy Hobie Doyle in their 2016 movie Hail, Caesar!, and Tim Blake Nelson portrays the title character in their 2018 movie The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. The musical group Riders in the Sky continues the tradition of the singing cowboy today.[15]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nSpace Western is a subgenre of science fiction that uses the themes and tropes of Westerns within science-fiction stories in an outer space setting.[1] Subtle influences may include exploration of new, lawless frontiers, while more overt influences may feature actual cowboys in outer space who use rayguns and ride robotic horses. Although initially popular, a strong backlash against perceived hack writing caused the genre to become a subtler influence until the 1980s, when it regained popularity. A further critical reappraisal occurred during the 2000s due to critical acclaim for Firefly.\\nThe space Western is a science fiction story that contains Western genre elements within an outer space setting.[1][2]:\\u200a1–3\\u200a  These Western themes can be explicit, such as cowboys in outer space, or they can be a more subtle influence in space opera.[2]:\\u200a3–4\\u200a The genre can be contrasted with science fiction Western, which generally relies on traditional Western frontier settings.[1] while the space Western, having its roots in science fiction, contains plots, tropes, or archetypes of the Western genre, but is generally set in outer space in a futuristic setting.[3]:\\u200a1\\u200a[4]\\nGene Roddenberry described Star Trek: The Original Series as a space Western (or, more poetically, as \"Wagon Train to the stars\").[5] Firefly and its cinematic follow-up Serenity literalized the Western aspects of the genre popularized by Star Trek: it used frontier towns, horses, and the styling of classic John Ford Westerns.[6][7] Worlds that have been terraformed may be depicted as presenting similar challenges as that of a frontier settlement in a classic Western.[8]  Six-shooters and horses may be replaced by ray guns and rockets.[9]\\nThe idea is that the vast distances of space have formed barriers, forcing people to become independent or even restricted. Popular themes within the genre are new frontiers in the galaxy and trying to \"control\" the vast expanse of space. The stories focus on the hardship and adventure of the unexplored space frontier.[10]\\nSpace Westerns sometimes intertwine with space opera and military science fiction[2]:\\u200a1–3\\u200a and are generally placed within the Space warfare in science fiction sub-genre thematic. Specifically written space Western fiction, movies and TV series are sometimes based on established space opera franchises with the expanded universes of Star Wars and Star Trek.[11] They often consider and view an interstellar war and oppression of a galactic empire as a backdrop, with a focus on lone gunslingers in space wielding a raygun with fantastic fictional technologies in a futuristic space-frontier setting.[12]\\nWesterns influenced early science-fiction pulp magazines. Writers would submit stories in both genres,[13] and science-fiction magazines sometimes mimicked Western cover art to showcase parallels.[2] In the 1930s, C. L. Moore created one of the first space Western heroes, Northwest Smith.[2] Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon were also early influences.[9] After superhero comics declined in popularity in 1940s United States, Western comics and horror comics replaced them. When horror comics became untenable with the Comics Code Authority in the mid-1950s, science-fiction themes and space Westerns grew more popular.[2]:\\u200a10\\u200a\\nBy the mid-1960s, classic Western films fell out of favor and revisionist Westerns supplanted them. Science-fiction series such as Lost in Space[14] and Star Trek presented a new frontier to be explored. Peter Hyams, director of Outland, said that studio heads in the 1980s were unwilling to finance a Western, so he made a space Western instead.[15] Outland took the plot directly from High Noon (1952) and placed it on Jupiter\\'s moon Io.[13]\\nSpace operas such as the Star Wars film series took strong cues from Westerns. Boba Fett, Han Solo and the Mos Eisley cantina, in particular, were based on Western themes. George Lucas attributes the character of Boba Fett to the Man with No Name in the DVD commentary on The Empire Strikes Back.[16] Han Solo\\'s original costume and charming rogue gunslinger mannerisms also reflects the Western\\'s influence on Star Wars. These science fiction-films and television series offered the themes and morals that Westerns previously did.[17]\\nThis frontier view of the future is only one of many ways to look at space exploration, and not one embraced by all science-fiction writers. The Turkey City Lexicon, a document produced by the Turkey City science-fiction writers\\' workshop, condemns the space Western as the \"most pernicious\" form of a pre-established background that avoids the necessity of creating a fresh world.[18] Galaxy Science Fiction ran an advertisement on its back cover, \"You\\'ll never see it in Galaxy\", which gave the beginnings of make-believe parallel Western and science-fiction stories featuring a character named Bat Durston.[19] The genre of space Westerns has been informally—and often derisively—known as \"Bat Durston\" stories since.[20] Such scathing attacks on the subgenre, along with further attacks on space operas, caused a perception that all space Westerns were by definition hack writing and not \"true\" science fiction.[9] Although the underlying themes remained influential, this bias persisted until the 1980s, when the release of the film Outland and children\\'s cartoons such as BraveStarr and The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers re-popularized explicit themes of cowboys in space.[9]\\nBraveStarr chronicles the adventures of the Space Marshal, as he seeks to uphold law and order in the 23rd century.[21] The opening trailer of The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers shows Texas Rangers–like heroes riding across a prairie landscape on robotic horses. Spaceships and six-guns both feature prominently throughout.[22]\\nIn the 1990s, Japanese manga and anime series such as Trigun (1995 debut), Outlaw Star (1996 debut) and Cowboy Bebop (1997 debut) explored the genre.  Several years later, Firefly won acclaim, further causing a critical reassessment of space Westerns.[9]\\nGames such as StarCraft,[23][24] The Outer Worlds,[25] and the Borderlands series[26] have also popularized the space Western theme.  Films like The Chronicles of Riddick have continued the space Western theme.[27]\\n\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe spaghetti Western is a broad subgenre of Western films produced in Europe. It emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone\\'s filmmaking style and international box-office success.[1] The term was used by foreign critics because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians.[2]\\nThe majority of the films in the spaghetti Western genre were international co-productions by Italy and Spain, and sometimes France, West Germany, Britain, Portugal, Greece, Yugoslavia, and the United States. Over six hundred European Westerns were made between 1960 and 1978.[3] Most spaghetti Westerns filmed between 1964 and 1978 were made on low budgets, and shot at Cinecittà Studios and various locations around southern Italy and Spain.[4]\\nLeone\\'s films and other core spaghetti Westerns are often described as having eschewed, criticized or even \"demythologized\"[5] many of the conventions of traditional U.S. Westerns. This was partly intentional, and partly the context of a different cultural background.[6] In 1968, the wave of spaghetti Westerns reached its crest, comprising one-third of the Italian film production, only to collapse to one-tenth in 1969. Spaghetti Westerns have left their mark on popular culture, strongly influencing numerous works produced in and outside of Italy.\\nAccording to veteran spaghetti Western actor Aldo Sambrell, the phrase spaghetti Western was coined by Spanish journalist Alfonso Sánchez in reference to the Italian food spaghetti.[7] Spaghetti Westerns are also known as Italian Westerns or, primarily in Japan, Macaroni Westerns.[8] In Italy, the genre is typically referred to as western all\\'italiana (Italian-style Western). Italo-Western is also used, especially in Germany.\\nThe term Eurowesterns has been used to broadly refer to all non-Italian Western movies from Europe, including the West German Winnetou films and the Eastern Bloc Red Western films. Taking its name from the Spanish rice dish, \"Paella Western\" has been used to refer to Western films produced in Spain.[9] The Japanese film Tampopo was promoted as a \"Ramen Western\".[10]\\nThe majority of the films in the spaghetti Western genre were international coproductions by Italy and Spain, and sometimes France, West Germany, Britain, Portugal, Greece, Yugoslavia, and the United States. Over six hundred European Westerns were made between 1960 and 1978.[3]\\nThese movies were originally released in Italian or with Italian dubbing, but, as most of the films featured multilingual casts, and sound was post-synched, most western all\\'italiana do not have an official dominant language.[11]\\nThe typical spaghetti Western team was made up of an Italian director, an Italo-Spanish[12] technical staff, and a cast of Italian, Spanish, and (sometimes) West German and American actors.\\nMost spaghetti Westerns filmed between 1964 and 1978 were made on low budgets, and shot at Cinecittà Studios and various locations around southern Italy and Spain.[4] Many of the stories take place in the dry landscapes of the American Southwest and Northern Mexico, thus, common filming locations were the Tabernas Desert and the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, an area of volcanic origin known for its wide sandy beaches, both of which are in the Province of Almería in Southeastern Spain. Some sets and studios built for spaghetti Westerns survived as theme parks, such as Texas Hollywood, Mini Hollywood, and Western Leone, and continue to be used as film sets.[13] Other filming locations used were in central and southern Italy, such as the parks of Valle del Treja (between Rome and Viterbo), the area of Camposecco (next to Camerata Nuova, characterized by a karst topography), the hills around Castelluccio, the town of Wuustwezel and the area around the Gran Sasso mountain, and the Tivoli\\'s quarries and Sardinia. God\\'s Gun was filmed in Israel.[14]\\nEuropean Westerns are as old as filmmaking itself. The Lumière brothers had their first public screening of films in 1895, and already, in 1896, Gabriel Veyre shot Repas d\\'Indien (Indian Banquet) for them. Joe Hamman starred as Arizona Bill in films made in the French horse country of Camargue (1911–1912).[15]\\nIn Italy, the American West as a dramatic setting for spectacles goes back at least as far as Giacomo Puccini\\'s 1910 opera La fanciulla del West (The Girl of the West), which is sometimes considered to be the first spaghetti Western.[16][17]\\nThe first Western movie made in Italy was La voce del sangue, produced by the Turin film studio Itala Film.[18] In 1913, La vampira Indiana was released; a combination of Western and vampire film. It was directed by Vincenzo Leone, father of Sergio Leone, and starred his mother, Bice Valerian, in the title role as the Indian princess Fatale.[19] The Italians also made Wild Bill Hickok films, while the Germans released backwoods Westerns featuring Bela Lugosi as Uncas.\\nOf the Western-related European films before 1964, the one that attracted the most attention is arguably Luis Trenker\\'s Der Kaiser von Kalifornien about John Sutter.[20] Another Italian Western is Girl of the Golden West. The film\\'s title alludes to the opera The Girl of the Golden West, by Giacomo Puccini, but is not an adaptation of it. It was one of a handful of Westerns to be made during the silent film and Fascist Italy eras.[21] Forerunners of the genre were also Giorgio Ferroni\\'s Il fanciullo del West (The Boy in the West) and Fernando Cerchio\\'s Il bandolero stanco, starring Erminio Macario and Renato Rascel, respectively.[22][23]\\nAfter World War II, there were scattered European uses of Western settings, mostly for comedy, musical or otherwise. A cycle of Western comedies was initiated in 1959 with La sceriffa and Il terrore dell’Oklahoma, followed by other films starring comedy specialists, such as Walter Chiari, Ugo Tognazzi, Raimondo Vianello, and Fernandel. An Italian critic has compared these comedies to American Bob Hope vehicles.[24]\\nThe first American-British Western filmed in Spain was The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw, directed by Raoul Walsh. It was followed by Savage Guns, a British-Spanish Western, again filmed in Spain. It marked the beginning of Spain as a suitable film-shooting location for any type of European Western. In 1961, an Italian company coproduced the French Taste of Violence, with a Mexican Revolution theme. In 1963, three non-comedy Italo-Spanish Westerns were produced: Gunfight at Red Sands, Implacable Three, and Gunfight at High Noon.\\nIn 1965, Bruno Bozzetto released his traditionally animated feature film West and Soda, a Western parody with a marked spaghetti Western-theme; despite having been released a year after Sergio Leone\\'s seminal spaghetti Western, A Fistful of Dollars, development of West and Soda actually began a year earlier than Fistful\\'s, and lasted longer, mainly because of the use of more time-demanding animation over regular acting. For this reason, Bozzetto claims to have invented the spaghetti Western genre.[25]\\nBecause there is no real consensus about where to draw the exact line between spaghetti Westerns and other Eurowesterns (or other Westerns in general), it cannot be said which film is definitively the first spaghetti Western. However, 1964 saw the breakthrough of this genre, with more than twenty productions or coproductions from Italian companies, and more than half a dozen Westerns by Spanish or Spanish-American companies. Furthermore, by far the most commercially successful of this lot was Sergio Leone\\'s A Fistful of Dollars. It was the innovations in cinematic style, music, acting and story of Leone\\'s first Western that decided that spaghetti Westerns became a distinct subgenre and not just a number of films looking like American Westerns.[26]\\nIn this seminal film, Leone used a distinct visual style with large face close ups to tell the story of a hero entering a town that is ruled by two outlaw gangs, and ordinary social relations are nonexistent. The hero betrays and plays the gangs against each other to make money. He uses his cunning and exceptional weapons skill to assist a family threatened by both gangs. His treachery is exposed, and he is severely beaten, but in the end, he defeats the remaining gang. The interactions in this story range between cunning and irony (the tricks, deceits, unexpected actions and sarcasm of the hero), and pathos (terror and brutality against defenseless people and against the hero after his doublecross has been revealed). Ennio Morricone\\'s innovative score expresses a similar duality between quirky and unusual sounds and instruments, and sacral dramatizing for the big confrontation scenes. Another important novelty was Clint Eastwood\\'s performance as the man with no name—an unshaven, sarcastic, insolent Western antihero with personal goals in mind, and with distinct visuals to boot—the squint, the cigarillo, the poncho, etc.[27]\\nThe spaghetti Western was born, flourished and faded in a highly commercial production environment. The Italian \"low\" popular film production was usually low-budget and low-profit, and the easiest way to success was imitating a proven success.[28] When the typically low-budget production, A Fistful of Dollars, turned into a remarkable box-office success, the industry eagerly lapped up its innovations. Most subsequent spaghetti Westerns tried to get a ragged, laconic hero with superhuman weapon skill, preferably one who looked like Clint Eastwood: Franco Nero, John Garko, and Terence Hill started out that way; Anthony Steffen and others stayed that way throughout their spaghetti Western careers.\\nWhoever the hero was, he would join an outlaw gang to further his own secret agenda, as in A Pistol for Ringo, Blood for a Silver Dollar, Vengeance Is a Dish Served Cold, Renegade Riders, and others, while Beyond the Law has a bandit infiltrate society and become a sheriff. There would be a flamboyant Mexican bandit (Gian Maria Volonté from A Fistful of Dollars, otherwise Tomas Milian, or most often Fernando Sancho) and a grumpy old man, often an undertaker, to serve as sidekick for the hero. For the love interest, ranchers\\' daughters, schoolmarms and barroom maidens were overshadowed by young Latin women desired by dangerous men, for which actresses, such as Nicoletta Machiavelli or Rosalba Neri, carried on Marianne Koch\\'s role of Marisol in the Leone film. The terror of the villains against their defenseless victims became just as ruthless as in A Fistful of Dollars, or more, and their brutalization of the hero when his treachery is disclosed became just as merciless, or more—similar to securing the latter\\'s retribution.[29]\\nIn the beginning, some films mixed some of these new devices with the borrowed U.S. Western devices typical for most of the 1963–1964 spaghetti Westerns. For example, in Sergio Corbucci\\'s Minnesota Clay, that appeared two months after A Fistful of Dollars, an American style \"tragic gunfighter\" hero who confronts two evil gangs, one Mexican and one Anglo, with (as in A Fistful of Dollars) the leader of the latter being the town sheriff.[30]\\nIn Johnny Oro, a traditional Western sheriff and a mixed-race bounty killer are forced into an uneasy alliance when Mexican bandits and Native Americans assault the town. In A Pistol for Ringo, a traditional sheriff commissions a money-oriented hero played by Giuliano Gemma (as deadly but with more pleasing manners than Eastwood\\'s character) to infiltrate a gang of Mexican bandits whose leader is played typically by Fernando Sancho.\\nAs with Leone\\'s first Western, the Dollars Trilogy strongly influenced the further developments of the genre, as did Sergio Corbucci\\'s Django and Enzo Barboni\\'s two Trinity films, as well as some other successful spaghetti Westerns.\\nAfter 1965, when Leone\\'s second Western, For a Few Dollars More, brought a larger box-office success, the profession of bounty hunter became the choice of occupation of spaghetti Western heroes in films, such as Arizona Colt, Vengeance Is Mine, Ten Thousand Dollars for a Massacre, The Ugly Ones, Dead Men Don\\'t Count, and Any Gun Can Play. In The Great Silence and A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die, the heroes instead fight bounty killers. During this era, many heroes and villains in spaghetti Westerns began carrying a musical watch, after its ingenious use in For a Few Dollars More.[31]\\nSpaghetti Westerns also began featuring a pair of different heroes. In Leone\\'s film, Eastwood\\'s character is an unshaven bounty hunter, dressed similarly to his character in A Fistful of Dollars, who enters an unstable partnership with Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), an older bounty killer who uses more sophisticated weaponry and wears a suit, and, in the end, turns out to also be an avenger. In the following years, there was a deluge of spaghetti Westerns with a pair of heroes with (most often) conflicting motives. Examples include a lawman and an outlaw (And the Crows Will Dig Your Grave), an army officer and an outlaw (Bury Them Deep), an avenger and a (covert) army officer (The Hills Run Red), an avenger and a (covert) guilty party (Viva! Django aka W Django!), an avenger and a con-man (The Dirty Outlaws), an outlaw posing as a sheriff and a bounty hunter (Man With the Golden Pistol aka Doc, Hands of Steel), and an outlaw posing as his twin and a bounty hunter posing as a sheriff (A Few Dollars for Django).[32]\\nThe theme of age in For a Few Dollars More, in which the younger bounty killer learns valuable lessons from his more experienced colleague and eventually becomes his equal, is taken up in Day of Anger and Death Rides a Horse. In both cases, Lee Van Cleef carries on as the older hero versus Giuliano Gemma and John Phillip Law, respectively.\\nOne variant of the hero pair was a revolutionary Mexican bandit and a mostly money-oriented American from the United States frontier. These films are sometimes called Zapata Westerns.[33] The first was Damiano Damiani\\'s A Bullet for the General and then followed Sergio Sollima\\'s trilogy: The Big Gundown, Face to Face, and Run, Man, Run.\\nSergio Corbucci\\'s The Mercenary and Compañeros and Tepepa by Giulio Petroni are also considered Zapata Westerns. Many of these films enjoyed both good takes at the box office and attention from critics. They are often interpreted as a leftist critique of the typical Hollywood handling of the Mexican Revolution, and of imperialism in general.[34]\\nIn Leone\\'s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly there is still the scheme of a pair of heroes vs. a villain but it is somewhat relaxed, as here all three parties were driven by a money motive. In subsequent films such as Any Gun Can Play (whose Italian title, \"Vado... l\\'ammazzo e torno\", is itself a quote from Leone\\'s film), One Dollar Too Many, and Kill Them All and Come Back Alone several main characters repeatedly form alliances and betray each other for monetary gain.[35]\\nSabata and If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death, directed by Gianfranco Parolini, introduce into similar betrayal environments a type of hero molded on the Mortimer character from For a Few Dollars More, only without any vengeance motive and with more outrageous trick weapons. Fittingly enough Sabata is portrayed by Lee Van Cleef himself, while John Garko plays the very similar Sartana protagonist. Parolini made some more Sabata movies, while Giuliano Carnimeo made a whole series of Sartana films with Garko.[36]\\nBeside the first three spaghetti Westerns by Leone, a most influential film was Sergio Corbucci\\'s Django starring Franco Nero. Django was one of the most violent spaghetti Westerns. The titular character is torn between several motives—money or revenge—and his choices bring misery to him and to a woman close to him. Indicative of this film\\'s influence on the spaghetti Western style, \"Django\" is the hero\\'s name in a plenitude of subsequent Westerns.[37]\\nAlthough his character is not named Django, Franco Nero brings a similar ambience to Texas, Adios and Massacre Time, in which the hero must confront surprising and dangerous family relations. Similar \"prodigal son\"[38] stories followed, including Chuck Moll, Keoma, The Return of Ringo, The Forgotten Pistolero, One Thousand Dollars on the Black, Johnny Hamlet and also Seven Dollars on the Red.[39]\\nAnother type of wronged hero is set up and must clear himself from accusations. Giuliano Gemma starred in a series of successful films carrying this theme—Adiós gringo, For a Few Extra Dollars, Long Days of Vengeance, Wanted and, to some extent, Blood for a Silver Dollar—in which his character is most often called \"Gary\".[40]\\nThe wronged hero who becomes an avenger appears in many spaghetti Westerns. Among the more commercially successful films with a hero dedicated to vengeance—For a Few Dollars More, Once Upon a Time in the West, Today We Kill... Tomorrow We Die!, A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die, Death Rides a Horse, Django, Prepare a Coffin, The Deserter, Hate for Hate, and Halleluja for Django—those with whom he cooperates typically have conflicting motivations.[41]\\nIn 1968, the wave of spaghetti Westerns reached its crest, comprising one-third of the Italian film production, only to collapse to one-tenth in 1969. However, the considerable box-office success of Enzo Barboni\\'s They Call Me Trinity and its pyramidal follow-up, Trinity Is Still My Name, gave Italian filmmakers a new model to emulate. The main characters were played by Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, who had already cooperated as a pair of heroes in three earlier spaghetti Westerns, God Forgives... I Don\\'t!, Boot Hill and Ace High, directed by Giuseppe Colizzi. The humor started in those movies, with scenes with comedy fighting, but the Barboni films became burlesque comedies. They feature the quick but lazy Trinity (Hill) and his big, strong and irritable brother, Bambino (Spencer).[42]\\nThe stories lampoon stereotypical Western characters, such as diligent farmers, lawmen and bounty hunters. There was a wave of Trinity-inspired films with quick and strong heroes, the former often called \"Trinity\", or coming from \"a place called Trinity\", and with few or no killings. Because the two model stories contained religious pacifists to account for the absence of gunplay, all of the successors contained religious groups, or, at least, priests, sometimes as one of the heroes.[43]\\nThe music for the two Trinity Westerns (composed by Franco Micalizzi and Guido & Maurizio De Angelis, respectively) also reflected the change to a lighter and more sentimental mood. The Trinity-inspired films also adopted this less serious and often-maligned style.[44]\\nSome critics deplore these post-Trinity films and their soundtracks as a degeneration of the \"real\" spaghetti Westerns. Indeed, Hill\\'s and Spencer\\'s skillful use of body language was a hard act to follow, and it is significant that the most successful of the post-Trinity films featured Hill (Man of the East and A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe), Spencer (It Can Be Done Amigo) and a pair of Hill-Spencer lookalikes in Carambola. A spaghetti Western old hand, Franco Nero, also worked in this subgenre with Cipolla Colt, and Tomas Milian plays an outrageous \"quick\" bounty hunter modeled on Charlie Chaplin\\'s Little Tramp in Sometimes Life Is Hard, Eh Providence? and Here We Go Again, Eh, Providence?.[45]\\nTerence Hill could still draw large audiences in a post-Trinity Western, My Name Is Nobody, with Henry Fonda, and a caper-story Western, A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe. The following year, Franco Nero achieved a similar draw as a Django-style hero in Keoma. However, by the end of the 1970s, the different types of spaghetti Westerns had lost their following among mainstream cinema audiences, and the production ground to a virtual halt. Belated attempts to revive the genre included the comedy film Buddy Goes West and a Spanish-American coproduction, Comin\\' at Ya!, which was shot in 3D, and Django Strikes Again.\\nSome movies that were not very successful at the box office[46] still earn a \"cult\" status in some segment of the audience because of certain extraordinary features in story and/or presentation. One \"cult\" spaghetti Western that has also drawn attention from critics is Giulio Questi\\'s Django Kill. Other \"cult\" items are Cesare Canevari\\'s Matalo!, Tony Anthony\\'s Blindman, and Joaquín Luis Romero Marchent\\'s Cut-Throats Nine (the latter among gore film audiences).\\nThe few spaghetti Westerns containing historical characters such as Buffalo Bill, Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, etc., appear mainly before A Fistful of Dollars had put its mark on the genre. Likewise, and in contrast to the contemporary German Westerns, few films feature Native Americans. When they appear, they are more often portrayed as victims of discrimination than as dangerous foes. The only fairly successful spaghetti Western with a Native American main character (played by Burt Reynolds in his only European Western outing) is Sergio Corbucci\\'s Navajo Joe, in which the (supposedly) Navajo village is wiped out by bandits during the first minutes, and the avenger hero spends the rest of the film dealing mostly with Anglos and Mexicans until the final showdown at a Native American burial ground.\\nSeveral spaghetti Westerns are inspired by classical myths and dramas. Titles, such as Fedra West (also called Ballad of a Bounty Hunter) and Johnny Hamlet, signify the connection to Greek myth, the plays by Euripides and Racine, and the play by William Shakespeare, respectively. The latter also inspired 1972\\'s Dust in the Sun, which follows the original more closely than Johnny Hamlet, in which the hero survives. The Forgotten Pistolero is based on the vengeance of Orestes. There are similarities between the story of The Return of Ringo and the last canto of Homer\\'s Odyssey. Fury of Johnny Kid follows Shakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet, but (again) with a different ending; the loving couple leave together while their families annihilate each other.\\nSome Italian Western films were made as vehicles for musical stars, such as Ferdinando Baldi\\'s Rita of the West, featuring Rita Pavone and Terence Hill. In non-singing roles were Ringo Starr as a villain in Blindman and French rock \\'n\\' roll veteran Johnny Hallyday as the gunfighter and avenger hero in Sergio Corbucci\\'s The Specialists.\\nThe story of A Fistful of Dollars was closely based on Akira Kurosawa\\'s Yojimbo. Kurosawa sued Sergio Leone for plagiarism, and was compensated with the exclusive distribution rights to the movie in Japan, where its hero, Clint Eastwood, was already a huge star due to the popularity of the TV series, Rawhide. Leone would have done far better financially by obtaining Kurosawa\\'s advance permission to use Yojimbo\\'s script.[47][48] Requiem for a Gringo shows many traces from another well-known Japanese film, Masaki Kobayashi\\'s Harakiri.\\nWhen Asian martial arts films started to draw crowds in European cinema houses, the producers of spaghetti Westerns tried to hang on, this time not by adapting storylines, but rather by directly including martial arts in the films, performed by Eastern actors—for example, Chen Lee in My Name Is Shanghai Joe, or Lo Lieh teaming up with Lee Van Cleef in The Stranger and the Gunfighter.\\nSome spaghetti Westerns incorporate political overtones, particularly from the political left. An example is Requiescant, featuring Italian author and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini as a major supporting character. Pasolini\\'s character is a priest who espouses Liberation theology. The film concerns oppression of poor Mexicans by rich Anglos, and ends on a call for arms, but it does not fit easily as a Zapata Western, for it lacks the typical hero pair of a flamboyant Latin revolutionary and an Anglo specialist. The Price of Power serves a political allegory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy and racism. The movie concerns the assassination of an American president in Dallas, Texas, by a group of Southern white supremacists who frame an innocent African-American. They are opposed by an unstable partnership between a whistleblower (Giuliano Gemma) and a political aide.\\nAlthough it is intimated in some films, such as Django Kill and Requiescant, open homosexuality plays a marginal part in spaghetti Westerns. An exception is Giorgio Capitani\\'s The Ruthless Four (in effect a gay version of John Huston\\'s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre), in which the explicit homosexual relation between two of its male main characters and some gay cueing scenes are embedded with other forms of man-to-man relations through the story.[49]\\nIn the 1960s, critics recognized that the American genres were rapidly changing. The genre most identifiably American, the Western, seemed to be evolving into a new, rougher form. For many critics, Sergio Leone\\'s films were part of the problem. Leone\\'s Dollars Trilogy (1964–1966) was not the beginning of the \"spaghetti Western\" cycle in Italy, but for some Americans, Leone\\'s films represented the true beginning of the Italian invasion of an American genre.\\nChristopher Frayling, in his noted book on the Italian Western, describes American critical reception of the spaghetti Western cycle as, to \"a large extent, confined to a sterile debate about the \\'cultural roots\\' of the American/Hollywood Western\".[50] He remarked that few critics dared admit that they were, in fact, \"bored with an exhausted Hollywood genre\".\\nFrayling noted that Pauline Kael was willing to acknowledge this critical ennui, and thus appreciate how a film like Akira Kurosawa\\'s Yojimbo \"could exploit the conventions of the Western genre, while debunking its morality\". Frayling and other film scholars, such as Bondanella, argue that this revisionism was the key to Leone\\'s success, and, to some degree, to that of the spaghetti Western genre as a whole.[51]\\nSpaghetti Westerns have left their mark on popular culture, strongly influencing numerous works produced in and outside of Italy. In later years, there were the \"return-of stories\" films Django Strikes Again with Franco Nero and Troublemakers with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. Clint Eastwood\\'s first American Western film, Hang \\'Em High, incorporates elements of spaghetti Westerns.\\nAmerican director Quentin Tarantino has utilized elements of spaghetti Westerns in his films Kill Bill (combined with kung fu movies),[52] Inglourious Basterds (set in Nazi-occupied France),[53] Django Unchained (set in the American South during the time of slavery),[54] The Hateful Eight (set in Wyoming post-US Civil War), and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (about fictional American actor Rick Dalton sometimes working in spaghetti Westerns).\\nThe Back to the Future trilogy pays homage to spaghetti Westerns (especially Sergio Leone\\'s Dollars Trilogy) on a variety of occasions, most notably in the third film. The American animated film Rango incorporates elements of spaghetti Westerns, including a character (the mystical \"Spirit of the West\", regarded as a sort of deity among the characters) appearing to the protagonist as an elderly Man with No Name. The 1985 Japanese film Tampopo was promoted as a \"ramen Western\". Japanese director Takashi Miike paid tribute to the genre with Sukiyaki Western Django, a Western set in Japan that derives influence from both Django and the Dollars Trilogy.[55]\\nThe Bollywood film Sholay was often referred to as a \"Curry Western\".[56] A more accurate genre label for the film is the \"Dacoit Western\", as it combined the conventions of Indian dacoit films, such as Mother India and Gunga Jumna, with that of spaghetti Westerns. Sholay spawned its own genre of \"Dacoit Western\" films in Bollywood during the 1970s.[57]\\nIn the Soviet Union, the spaghetti Western was adapted into the Ostern (\"Eastern\") genre of Soviet films. The Wild West setting was replaced by an Eastern setting in the steppes of the Caucasus, while Western stock characters, such as \"cowboys and Indians\", were replaced by Caucasian stock characters, such as bandits and harems. A famous example of the genre was White Sun of the Desert, which was popular in the Soviet Union.[58]\\nAmerican heavy metal band Metallica has used a Ennio Morricone\\'s composition, \"The Ecstasy of Gold\", from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, to open several of their concerts. An Australian band, the Tango Saloon, combined elements of tango music with influences from spaghetti Western scores. The band Ghoultown also derives influence from spaghetti Westerns.[59] The music video for the song \"Knights of Cydonia\", by the English rock band Muse, is influenced by spaghetti Westerns. The band Big Audio Dynamite used music samples from spaghetti Westerns when mixing their song \"Medicine Show\". Within the song, there are samples from spaghetti Western movies such as A Fistful of Dollars, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and Duck, You Sucker!.[60]\\nVideo game studio Rockstar Games utilized aspects of the spaghetti Western, and paid homage to it in their Red Dead Redemption series, as well as in its predecessor, Red Dead Revolver.[61]\\nIn 2007, a retrospective took place as part of the Venice International Film Festival to pay homage to the genre. The retrospective included 32 films:[66]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWeird West, also known as Weird Western, is a term used for the hybrid genres of fantasy Western, horror Western and science fiction Western.[1] The term originated with DC\\'s Weird Western Tales in 1972, but the idea is older as the genres have been blended since the 1930s, possibly earlier, in B-movie Westerns, comic books, movie serials and pulp magazines.[1] Individually, the hybrid genres combine elements of the Western genre with those of fantasy, horror and science fiction respectively.[2]\\nTwo early examples of Western fantasy are  the short story \"The Horror from the Mound\" by Robert E. Howard, published in the May 1932 issue of the pulp magazine Weird Tales,[3] and the novelette \"Spud and Cochise\" by anthropologist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Oliver La Farge, published in the non-genre magazine The Forum in January 1936.[4]\\nOne of the earliest novels to introduce fantasy into a Western setting was The Circus of Dr. Lao (1935), by Charles G. Finney, which won a National Book Award for the Most Original Book of 1935.[5] The novel concerns the visit to a fictional Arizona town by a magical circus that features legendary creatures from mythology. It was later adapted into the film version 7 Faces of Dr. Lao (1963).[6]\\nLater novels include those by Joe R. Lansdale, many featuring the heroic Reverend Jebediah Mercer. Lansdale has often mixed splatterpunk with alternate history Western.[7][8] An example is Dead in the West (1983), in which zombies rise after an unjustly lynched Native American shaman has cursed the town of Mud Creek, Texas.[9][10] The prolific Western author Louis L\\'Amour sometimes ventured into science fiction, as with The Haunted Mesa (1987), which is set amid the ruins of the Anasazi.[11] Horror author Jack Ketchum\\'s work includes The Crossings (2004), an occult novel set in 1848 Arizona.[12] Author Edward M. Erdelac\\'s 2009 series Merkabah Rider follows a Hasidic gunslinger tracking the renegade teacher who betrayed his mystic Jewish order of astral travelers to the Great Old Ones of H.P. Lovecraft.\\nFrom the 1940s, many Western comics published stories in which heroes would sometimes encounter monsters, aliens, supervillains, etc. Marvel Comics featured Kid Colt, the longest-running Western character in American comic books, from 1948 to 1979. He became a time traveller, and ultimately, a mutant.[13] The Rawhide Kid, another Marvel time traveller, debuted in a 16-issue series, from March 1955 to September 1957, from Marvel\\'s 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics.[14]\\nDC Comics added a horror element to their Western stories by introducing Weird Western Tales in 1972. The title of this series gave rise to the term \"Weird West\". It ran for eight years and 59 issues. The main character was Jonah Hex, whose popularity secured his own eponymous series.[15][16]\\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Desperadoes by Jeff Mariotte, from Image Comics/WildStorm Productions, returned weird Western comics to the stands at a time when none of the major publishers had Western comics in their line-ups.[17]\\nPreacher Special: Saint of Killers, a 4-issue mini-series, was a spin-off from Preacher by Garth Ennis. While the origin of the Saint of Killers in the Old West is the only true Western element in the comic book Preacher, the series has been described as a \"Splatterpunk Western\" or a mix of the Western with the Gothic.[18]\\nIn film, The Phantom Empire (1935) is sometimes considered the first fantasy Western. Gene Autry, in his first starring role as a singing cowboy, ventures down a mineshaft and discovers a futuristic lost kingdom of the type depicted in Flash Gordon.[19] Sci-fi and horror Westerns began in the 1950s with the vampire Western Curse of the Undead, and the science fiction Western, The Beast of Hollow Mountain about a prehistoric dinosaur in a turn-of-the-century Mexican village, and continued in the 1960s with films like Billy the Kid Versus Dracula (1966), which depicted the real-life outlaw fighting against the fictional vampire,[20][1] and The Valley of Gwangi (1969), in which Ray Harryhausen\\'s special effects were used to pit cowboys against dinosaurs again.[19][1] Other Westerns with elements of fantasy, horror or science fiction are 7 Faces of Dr. Lao (1964),[6] Jesse James Meets Frankenstein\\'s Daughter (1966), Bang Bang Kid (1967), High Plains Drifter (1973),[21] Get Mean (1975), The White Buffalo (1977),[22] Pale Rider (1985),[21] Ghost Town (1988),[20] Back to the Future Part III (1990), Wild Wild West (1999),[23][24] Purgatory (1999), Jonah Hex (2010),[25] and Bone Tomahawk (2015).[26]\\nIn the 1960s, the television series The Wild Wild West brought elements of pulp espionage and science fiction to its Old West setting.[27][28] The animated adventures of The Lone Ranger followed suit, with the famous Western hero encountering mad scientists and other villains not often found in the Western genre.[29] Additionally, Rod Serling\\'s supernatural anthology series The Twilight Zone featured a handful of Western episodes, such as \"Showdown with Rance McGrew\".[30] Later series include The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. (1993–1994), which featured steampunk elements;[31] Wynonna Earp (2016), a horror Western about a present-day woman with a magic Colt Buntline revolver who fights reincarnations of outlaws killed by her ancestor, Wyatt Earp;[32] and Preacher (2016), based on the comic book series of the same name.\\nDeadlands, first published by Pinnacle Entertainment Group in 1996, originated as a role-playing game which combines the Western and horror genres with steampunk elements. It is set in an alternate 1870s America and draws heavily on gothic horror conventions and old Native American lore to derive its sense of the supernatural. Characters can get involved in situations ranging from bank heists to shoot-outs involving vampires and zombies over the course of their adventures.[33]\\nThe Japanese RPG series Wild Arms, although set in a world of its own, distinctively draws notable inspiration from the Wild West imagery and combines it with magical and fantasy elements which are typical to the genre.\\nDamnation (2009) is set in alternate universe where the American Civil War was prolonged indefinitely due to advanced steam technology, with the player being tasked with stopping the army of a mad inventor bent on taking over the country.\\nUndead Nightmare (2010), an expansion to Red Dead Redemption (2010), is a horror Western video game. It tells the tale of an undead outbreak that has spread across the frontier. Other fantasy elements are new weapons such as holy water, and new mythical mounts, which include a unicorn and the Four Horses of the Apocalypse. Its sequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, features a number of minor Easter eggs for the player to discover, such as UFOs and the remains of a giant hominid.[34]\\nWeird West (2022) is a top-down action role-playing game with elements of the immersive sim genre, with randomized elements through each playthrough.\\nHard West (2015) is a turn-based tactical and strategic video game, as well as its sequel, Hard West 2 (2022).\\nHunt: Showdown is a multiplayer PvPvE FPS video game.\\nEvil West (2022) is a third-person shooter with hack and slash and role-playing game elements.\\nLess-common hybrid genres may include the acid Western – The Shooting (1966) has been cited as the first film of this kind.[35] The horror Western essentially depicts the supernatural in an Old West setting. Kim Newman proposes the two main types are the \"Indian Curse cycle\" and the gothic Western – featuring vampires, zombies, and the like.[20] An example of the Indian Curse movie is The Ghost Dance (1982), in which a Native American shaman is possessed by an evil spirit.[36][20] A gothic Western example is Ghost Town (1988), about the quest of a sheriff to defeat a zombie gunfighter by using his star-shaped badge as a shuriken.[20]\\nThe steampunk Western, a variant of the science fiction Western using the retrofuturistic technology and aesthetic of the steampunk subgenre, typically depicts an alternative history of the Old West but emphasizes society\\'s reliance on steam power, as in the 1960s TV series The Wild Wild West.[23][24] Another variant of the science-fiction Western is the space Western, which applies Western themes to a science-fiction frontier setting. As such, these works are usually set on other worlds, such as in the series Firefly, but the action sometimes takes place in the Old West, as in Cowboys & Aliens (2011), in which an alien spacecraft lands in 1870s New Mexico Territory.[37]\\n',\n",
       "  \"Western romance literature denotes a genre subset of romance literature, sometimes referred to as cowboy romance. Works within this category typically adhere to the characteristics of romance but take place in a western setting, frequently the American frontier.[1] Though often historical, the genre is not restricted to romantic works set in the period of American settlement but extends to contemporary romantic works that centre around cowboys or other tropes of the Western genre.[2]\\nThe genre originated in the 1800s, popularised by the works of Bret Harte,[3] Zane Grey[4] and Catharine Sedgwick[1] who wrote love stories about cowboys and their heroines, and often their conflict with Native Americans.[1][4][3] The genre gained mass readership in the 1950s with the rise of ranch romance magazines and in modern day, the Western romance pulp fiction novel like that published by Mills and Boon[5] or Harlequin.[2]\\nThese stories typically follow the romance of a cowboy, ranch hand or bull rider and his heroine, contrasting the fragility of love with the severity of the harsh landscape.[4] They're usually set on the American frontier, rurally, in a ranch or on a farm.[6] The genre also appears throughout original and adapted films, such as Last of the Mohicans (1992),[7] Brokeback Mountain (2006),[8] The Longest Ride (2015) and Shane (1953).[9]\\nThe Western romance genre dates back to the early 1800s with the rise of the classic cowboy and the pursuit of his heroine.  Authors such as Zane Grey, Bret Harte and James Fenimore Cooper dominated this period.[3]\\nBefore the genre peaked in the early 1900s, authors such as Owen Wister and Sir Walter Scott paved the way for the rise of the Western romance genre. Grey was influenced by the likes of Wister, specifically by Wister's most famous novel, The Virginian (1902). It celebrated romance on the American frontier and oscillated, (as is characteristic of the genre) between the beauty of a woman's love and the treachery and violence of the landscape.[10]  Wister's work was characterised by his intermeshing of romance conventions with social realism, incorporating ideas of class and heritage to reflect the concerns of his time[11]\\nIt was within their work that the “Indian killing, heroine rescuing” cowboy came to be.[10] Grey became known for his work in this genre (under the publisher, Harper's) and the hugely successful Western Romantic novel Riders of the Purple Sage (1912).  The novel centres around a cowboy named Lassister and his relationship with his virginal heroine, Jane, set against the backdrop of the severe American frontier.  According to Danney Goble, it was “Grey's combination of brutal violence and saccharine romance - a heady mixture all but unknown to his predecessors in the writing of frontier fiction – [that] established his claim to a gold mine which he exploited time and again”.[4]  Many critics suggest Grey's romances offered a vision of hope in America, the triumph of good over evil, the unity of the cowboy and his heroine and the prevailing of traditional values in world rocked by war and social upheaval.[4]\\nJames Fenimore Cooper was another influential writer of Western romance fiction in the 19th century as was Bret Harte, both having become known for furthering the myth of the idealised cowboy in Romantic literature.[3]  Cooper has been credited as the father of Western literature, and a pioneer in Western romance writing specifically. His 1826 novel, The Last of the Mohicans (the second instalment of three in The Leather Stocking Tales) is considered one of the most beloved works within the genre.[12] In fact, the 1993 film adaptation also gained great success.[13] The Last of the Mohicans created the framework for Western romance literature from then on, establishing tropes like the ‘captive heroine’, adhering to ideologies of 19th century America that praised progress and reflected a changing relationship with Native Americans.[12]\\nAccording to Cheri Ross, the portrayal of Native Americans in traditional Western romances is fundamentally racist and tinged with white American patriotism. The Indian is conventionally the clear villain, often the captor of the cowboy's heroine and portrayed as savage and violent.[1] However, as writer Ernest Stromberg has pointed out, the depiction of Native Americans in Western romance has changed over time. Western romance films from the 1990s such as Dances with Wolves were revered for their positive portrayal of Native Indian characters. In the case of Dances with Wolves, many critics noted that the American Indians were portrayed as multi-dimensional characters, imbued with audience's sympathy and worked to demystify the white depiction of Western expansion.[14] The film was not only critically praised but achieved commercial success too.[14] Although, as Stromberg notes, Dances With Wolves does adhere to old-fashioned conventions of romance as the story is led by two white protagonists.[14]\\nThough male writers dominated the Western romance genre during its early iteration, female writers like Catharine Sedgwick had success too. Sedgwick is best known for her novel Hope Leslie (1827) and its experimentation with the popular form.  Sedgwick's novels both adhered to conventions of Romantic literature and the marriage plot yet offered unconventional portrayals of women and American Indians, through a non-racist, lens.\\nWestern romance has been popular with female audiences since its inception. It was written of Zane Grey's Riders of the Purple Sage that “the publisher initially rejected the manuscript because of its harsh treatment of polygamy and the Mormon hierarchy, but the reluctance was over come after an enthusiastic reading by the publisher’s wife”.[10]  Contrastingly, feminist scholars such as Madelon E. Heatherington have criticised early Western romance writers such as Owen Wister and Zane Grey for their stereotypical female characters and adherence to a binary between good, pure female characters and bad, unlikeable female characters.[15]\\nAccording to Goble, Zane Grey's heroines tended to differ from the typical portrayal of a love interest in the 20th century, namely lacking the autonomy women of this time were gaining.[4]  His love interests were largely depicted to be reliant on their hero and morally pure.[4]  In Riders of the Purple Sage, among many of Grey's other works, the heroine's beauty and virtue contrasts the savage frontier.  Recurringly throughout his writing, Grey envisioned a delicate ranch woman who, through such virtue, attempted to tame her mannish hero.[4] His heroine, Patricia Edgerton of The Deer Stalker (1925) rejected modernity and the ‘New Woman’ in her dress and attitudes, forgoing styles that had become popular at the turn of the century, such as short hair and smoking.[4]  Critics such as Gobble argue Grey's heroines were thus reflections of the simple, enduring, old world values of the West, rather than reflections of modern women.[4]\\nThe 1950s saw the rise of pulp Western romances in magazine form known as ranch romances or rangeland love stories. In keeping with the genre, these magazines generally depicted love stories centering around cowboys and their heroines.  Ranch romances remained popular during the Great Depression and continued to be published into the 1970s.  Though ranch romances were predominantly written by men, they were distinct for their heroines known as “your sister”. These women embodied a departure from traditional female roles through their independence and courage while maintaining their femininity.[16]\\nDuring the 1970s the consumption of Western romance shifted from magazine to novel form. Publishers, Harlequin and Mills & Boon published novels for their predominantly female readership focusing on female desire and fantasy.[2] Western romance as a genre flourished within the structure of the pulp fiction novel, generally written simply for easy reading.[2] Cowboy romances such as these are extremely popular for their “rugged individualism…unadorned masculinity…and ultimate heroism” as William W Savage Jr. notes in his book, The Cowboy Hero: His Image in American History and Culture.[17]  Cowboys have traditionally been perceived as All American, associated with courage and old world chivalry. While these pulp novels have been criticised for their overt sexualisation of both male and female characters, gaining the title “bodice rippers”,[18] other scholars have defended pulp Western romances for their female heroines and female driven plots.[5]\\nThere has been some contention over the portrayal of women in contemporary Western romance novels.[5]  Scholars such as Lee Tobin-McLain have criticised historical romances in general for their, at times, glorified depiction of sexual violence.[18]  The genre earned the title of “bodice ripper” in the early 1980s among a group of feminist writers led by Janice Radway.[18]  Radway criticised the genre for its frequent depiction of aggressive male heroes and submissive heroines.[18]\\nOn the contrary, other scholars have noted that works within the genre, especially the novels published by Mills and Boon, are female led, praising them for their focus on female desire and fantasy.[5] Mills and Boon romances generally emphasise the heroine's journey, her fears, motivations and aspirations and are typically written from a female perspective.[5]  In this way they differ from pure Western works which almost exclusively centre around a male protagonist and written for a male audience.[15] What's more, Tobin-McClain himself notes it is increasingly rare for recent Western romance novels to depict such violence.[18]\\nWestern romance literature extends beyond American settings. Canadian and Australian rural romance literature has also become increasingly popular, paralleling the American frontier and adhering to the same tropes and imagery.[19]  Australian outback romances centre around the heroine, her love interest and the severity of the unconquered landscape. They range in setting from the early colonisation of Australia to contemporary stories set on farms and ranches.[19]  According to Lauren O’Mahoney, these types of Western romances tend to be much darker.[19]  They emphasise a sense of mortality that is echoed in the severity of the outback where the closeness of death is constantly apparent.[19]  Tragedy is a far more prevalent element of Australian rural romances in which suicide, forbidden love and hopelessness are key tropes, as illustrated in Rachel Treasure's iconic Australian rural romance novel, Jillaroo (2002).[19]\\nThe Western romance genre is by its nature a hybrid of Western and romantic literature and it is often categorized as a subset of the former or latter.[20] The Western genre is highly distinct, containing its own specific tropes, iconography, themes and style.[20]  Works classified as Westerns often bleed into many genres, categorised by sub genres such as frontier drama, melodrama, comedy, musical and romance.[21]\\nCheri Ross surmises the conventions of traditional, early works within the genre as established by 1824.[1]  Such Western romances stories tended to adhere to categories which blend the two wider genres: often led by a patriotic American ideology, a clear division between good and evil characters, a submissive heroine in need of rescue (held captive by the villainous American Indians) and the unity of the cowboy and his heroine at the narrative's conclusion.[1]\\nWestern romances can be categorized into even more specific sub-genre classifications. These include the traditional Western romance which often incorporates tropes like saloons and bank robberies, contemporary Western romances set in modern-day on a ranch or farm and Amish or faith based Western romances.[6]\\nThe Western romance genre extends beyond literature, to a wide range of films.  Western romance films had their beginning in popular movies such as Shane (1953), which took place in a traditional, rural setting.[22]  Director, Sergio Leone is often regarded as having invented the Spaghetti Western film, his Westerns generally intersecting romance and drama. His most famous Western romance films include The Good the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).[23]  In the 1980s and 1990s the genre had great resurgence with the success of The Last of the Mohicans (1992)[24] and Dances with Wolves (1990).[25] In contemporary cinema, Western romances have been known to experiment with traditional conventions of romance. Films including Brokeback Mountain (2005),[26] Desert Hearts (1985)[27] and Midnight Cowboy (1969)[28] centre around same sex romances (though in the third example it is only implied).  In films such as Brokeback Mountain, the unconventional same sex love plot contrasts the severity of the American West and conservative society in 1950s America.[29] Their romance represents the division between freedom and civilization, typical of Western romance stories.[29]\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThe spaghetti Western is a broad subgenre of Western films produced in Europe. It emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone\\'s filmmaking style and international box-office success.[1] The term was used by foreign critics because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians.[2]\\nThe majority of the films in the spaghetti Western genre were international co-productions by Italy and Spain, and sometimes France, West Germany, Britain, Portugal, Greece, Yugoslavia, and the United States. Over six hundred European Westerns were made between 1960 and 1978.[3] Most spaghetti Westerns filmed between 1964 and 1978 were made on low budgets, and shot at Cinecittà Studios and various locations around southern Italy and Spain.[4]\\nLeone\\'s films and other core spaghetti Westerns are often described as having eschewed, criticized or even \"demythologized\"[5] many of the conventions of traditional U.S. Westerns. This was partly intentional, and partly the context of a different cultural background.[6] In 1968, the wave of spaghetti Westerns reached its crest, comprising one-third of the Italian film production, only to collapse to one-tenth in 1969. Spaghetti Westerns have left their mark on popular culture, strongly influencing numerous works produced in and outside of Italy.\\nAccording to veteran spaghetti Western actor Aldo Sambrell, the phrase spaghetti Western was coined by Spanish journalist Alfonso Sánchez in reference to the Italian food spaghetti.[7] Spaghetti Westerns are also known as Italian Westerns or, primarily in Japan, Macaroni Westerns.[8] In Italy, the genre is typically referred to as western all\\'italiana (Italian-style Western). Italo-Western is also used, especially in Germany.\\nThe term Eurowesterns has been used to broadly refer to all non-Italian Western movies from Europe, including the West German Winnetou films and the Eastern Bloc Red Western films. Taking its name from the Spanish rice dish, \"Paella Western\" has been used to refer to Western films produced in Spain.[9] The Japanese film Tampopo was promoted as a \"Ramen Western\".[10]\\nThe majority of the films in the spaghetti Western genre were international coproductions by Italy and Spain, and sometimes France, West Germany, Britain, Portugal, Greece, Yugoslavia, and the United States. Over six hundred European Westerns were made between 1960 and 1978.[3]\\nThese movies were originally released in Italian or with Italian dubbing, but, as most of the films featured multilingual casts, and sound was post-synched, most western all\\'italiana do not have an official dominant language.[11]\\nThe typical spaghetti Western team was made up of an Italian director, an Italo-Spanish[12] technical staff, and a cast of Italian, Spanish, and (sometimes) West German and American actors.\\nMost spaghetti Westerns filmed between 1964 and 1978 were made on low budgets, and shot at Cinecittà Studios and various locations around southern Italy and Spain.[4] Many of the stories take place in the dry landscapes of the American Southwest and Northern Mexico, thus, common filming locations were the Tabernas Desert and the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, an area of volcanic origin known for its wide sandy beaches, both of which are in the Province of Almería in Southeastern Spain. Some sets and studios built for spaghetti Westerns survived as theme parks, such as Texas Hollywood, Mini Hollywood, and Western Leone, and continue to be used as film sets.[13] Other filming locations used were in central and southern Italy, such as the parks of Valle del Treja (between Rome and Viterbo), the area of Camposecco (next to Camerata Nuova, characterized by a karst topography), the hills around Castelluccio, the town of Wuustwezel and the area around the Gran Sasso mountain, and the Tivoli\\'s quarries and Sardinia. God\\'s Gun was filmed in Israel.[14]\\nEuropean Westerns are as old as filmmaking itself. The Lumière brothers had their first public screening of films in 1895, and already, in 1896, Gabriel Veyre shot Repas d\\'Indien (Indian Banquet) for them. Joe Hamman starred as Arizona Bill in films made in the French horse country of Camargue (1911–1912).[15]\\nIn Italy, the American West as a dramatic setting for spectacles goes back at least as far as Giacomo Puccini\\'s 1910 opera La fanciulla del West (The Girl of the West), which is sometimes considered to be the first spaghetti Western.[16][17]\\nThe first Western movie made in Italy was La voce del sangue, produced by the Turin film studio Itala Film.[18] In 1913, La vampira Indiana was released; a combination of Western and vampire film. It was directed by Vincenzo Leone, father of Sergio Leone, and starred his mother, Bice Valerian, in the title role as the Indian princess Fatale.[19] The Italians also made Wild Bill Hickok films, while the Germans released backwoods Westerns featuring Bela Lugosi as Uncas.\\nOf the Western-related European films before 1964, the one that attracted the most attention is arguably Luis Trenker\\'s Der Kaiser von Kalifornien about John Sutter.[20] Another Italian Western is Girl of the Golden West. The film\\'s title alludes to the opera The Girl of the Golden West, by Giacomo Puccini, but is not an adaptation of it. It was one of a handful of Westerns to be made during the silent film and Fascist Italy eras.[21] Forerunners of the genre were also Giorgio Ferroni\\'s Il fanciullo del West (The Boy in the West) and Fernando Cerchio\\'s Il bandolero stanco, starring Erminio Macario and Renato Rascel, respectively.[22][23]\\nAfter World War II, there were scattered European uses of Western settings, mostly for comedy, musical or otherwise. A cycle of Western comedies was initiated in 1959 with La sceriffa and Il terrore dell’Oklahoma, followed by other films starring comedy specialists, such as Walter Chiari, Ugo Tognazzi, Raimondo Vianello, and Fernandel. An Italian critic has compared these comedies to American Bob Hope vehicles.[24]\\nThe first American-British Western filmed in Spain was The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw, directed by Raoul Walsh. It was followed by Savage Guns, a British-Spanish Western, again filmed in Spain. It marked the beginning of Spain as a suitable film-shooting location for any type of European Western. In 1961, an Italian company coproduced the French Taste of Violence, with a Mexican Revolution theme. In 1963, three non-comedy Italo-Spanish Westerns were produced: Gunfight at Red Sands, Implacable Three, and Gunfight at High Noon.\\nIn 1965, Bruno Bozzetto released his traditionally animated feature film West and Soda, a Western parody with a marked spaghetti Western-theme; despite having been released a year after Sergio Leone\\'s seminal spaghetti Western, A Fistful of Dollars, development of West and Soda actually began a year earlier than Fistful\\'s, and lasted longer, mainly because of the use of more time-demanding animation over regular acting. For this reason, Bozzetto claims to have invented the spaghetti Western genre.[25]\\nBecause there is no real consensus about where to draw the exact line between spaghetti Westerns and other Eurowesterns (or other Westerns in general), it cannot be said which film is definitively the first spaghetti Western. However, 1964 saw the breakthrough of this genre, with more than twenty productions or coproductions from Italian companies, and more than half a dozen Westerns by Spanish or Spanish-American companies. Furthermore, by far the most commercially successful of this lot was Sergio Leone\\'s A Fistful of Dollars. It was the innovations in cinematic style, music, acting and story of Leone\\'s first Western that decided that spaghetti Westerns became a distinct subgenre and not just a number of films looking like American Westerns.[26]\\nIn this seminal film, Leone used a distinct visual style with large face close ups to tell the story of a hero entering a town that is ruled by two outlaw gangs, and ordinary social relations are nonexistent. The hero betrays and plays the gangs against each other to make money. He uses his cunning and exceptional weapons skill to assist a family threatened by both gangs. His treachery is exposed, and he is severely beaten, but in the end, he defeats the remaining gang. The interactions in this story range between cunning and irony (the tricks, deceits, unexpected actions and sarcasm of the hero), and pathos (terror and brutality against defenseless people and against the hero after his doublecross has been revealed). Ennio Morricone\\'s innovative score expresses a similar duality between quirky and unusual sounds and instruments, and sacral dramatizing for the big confrontation scenes. Another important novelty was Clint Eastwood\\'s performance as the man with no name—an unshaven, sarcastic, insolent Western antihero with personal goals in mind, and with distinct visuals to boot—the squint, the cigarillo, the poncho, etc.[27]\\nThe spaghetti Western was born, flourished and faded in a highly commercial production environment. The Italian \"low\" popular film production was usually low-budget and low-profit, and the easiest way to success was imitating a proven success.[28] When the typically low-budget production, A Fistful of Dollars, turned into a remarkable box-office success, the industry eagerly lapped up its innovations. Most subsequent spaghetti Westerns tried to get a ragged, laconic hero with superhuman weapon skill, preferably one who looked like Clint Eastwood: Franco Nero, John Garko, and Terence Hill started out that way; Anthony Steffen and others stayed that way throughout their spaghetti Western careers.\\nWhoever the hero was, he would join an outlaw gang to further his own secret agenda, as in A Pistol for Ringo, Blood for a Silver Dollar, Vengeance Is a Dish Served Cold, Renegade Riders, and others, while Beyond the Law has a bandit infiltrate society and become a sheriff. There would be a flamboyant Mexican bandit (Gian Maria Volonté from A Fistful of Dollars, otherwise Tomas Milian, or most often Fernando Sancho) and a grumpy old man, often an undertaker, to serve as sidekick for the hero. For the love interest, ranchers\\' daughters, schoolmarms and barroom maidens were overshadowed by young Latin women desired by dangerous men, for which actresses, such as Nicoletta Machiavelli or Rosalba Neri, carried on Marianne Koch\\'s role of Marisol in the Leone film. The terror of the villains against their defenseless victims became just as ruthless as in A Fistful of Dollars, or more, and their brutalization of the hero when his treachery is disclosed became just as merciless, or more—similar to securing the latter\\'s retribution.[29]\\nIn the beginning, some films mixed some of these new devices with the borrowed U.S. Western devices typical for most of the 1963–1964 spaghetti Westerns. For example, in Sergio Corbucci\\'s Minnesota Clay, that appeared two months after A Fistful of Dollars, an American style \"tragic gunfighter\" hero who confronts two evil gangs, one Mexican and one Anglo, with (as in A Fistful of Dollars) the leader of the latter being the town sheriff.[30]\\nIn Johnny Oro, a traditional Western sheriff and a mixed-race bounty killer are forced into an uneasy alliance when Mexican bandits and Native Americans assault the town. In A Pistol for Ringo, a traditional sheriff commissions a money-oriented hero played by Giuliano Gemma (as deadly but with more pleasing manners than Eastwood\\'s character) to infiltrate a gang of Mexican bandits whose leader is played typically by Fernando Sancho.\\nAs with Leone\\'s first Western, the Dollars Trilogy strongly influenced the further developments of the genre, as did Sergio Corbucci\\'s Django and Enzo Barboni\\'s two Trinity films, as well as some other successful spaghetti Westerns.\\nAfter 1965, when Leone\\'s second Western, For a Few Dollars More, brought a larger box-office success, the profession of bounty hunter became the choice of occupation of spaghetti Western heroes in films, such as Arizona Colt, Vengeance Is Mine, Ten Thousand Dollars for a Massacre, The Ugly Ones, Dead Men Don\\'t Count, and Any Gun Can Play. In The Great Silence and A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die, the heroes instead fight bounty killers. During this era, many heroes and villains in spaghetti Westerns began carrying a musical watch, after its ingenious use in For a Few Dollars More.[31]\\nSpaghetti Westerns also began featuring a pair of different heroes. In Leone\\'s film, Eastwood\\'s character is an unshaven bounty hunter, dressed similarly to his character in A Fistful of Dollars, who enters an unstable partnership with Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), an older bounty killer who uses more sophisticated weaponry and wears a suit, and, in the end, turns out to also be an avenger. In the following years, there was a deluge of spaghetti Westerns with a pair of heroes with (most often) conflicting motives. Examples include a lawman and an outlaw (And the Crows Will Dig Your Grave), an army officer and an outlaw (Bury Them Deep), an avenger and a (covert) army officer (The Hills Run Red), an avenger and a (covert) guilty party (Viva! Django aka W Django!), an avenger and a con-man (The Dirty Outlaws), an outlaw posing as a sheriff and a bounty hunter (Man With the Golden Pistol aka Doc, Hands of Steel), and an outlaw posing as his twin and a bounty hunter posing as a sheriff (A Few Dollars for Django).[32]\\nThe theme of age in For a Few Dollars More, in which the younger bounty killer learns valuable lessons from his more experienced colleague and eventually becomes his equal, is taken up in Day of Anger and Death Rides a Horse. In both cases, Lee Van Cleef carries on as the older hero versus Giuliano Gemma and John Phillip Law, respectively.\\nOne variant of the hero pair was a revolutionary Mexican bandit and a mostly money-oriented American from the United States frontier. These films are sometimes called Zapata Westerns.[33] The first was Damiano Damiani\\'s A Bullet for the General and then followed Sergio Sollima\\'s trilogy: The Big Gundown, Face to Face, and Run, Man, Run.\\nSergio Corbucci\\'s The Mercenary and Compañeros and Tepepa by Giulio Petroni are also considered Zapata Westerns. Many of these films enjoyed both good takes at the box office and attention from critics. They are often interpreted as a leftist critique of the typical Hollywood handling of the Mexican Revolution, and of imperialism in general.[34]\\nIn Leone\\'s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly there is still the scheme of a pair of heroes vs. a villain but it is somewhat relaxed, as here all three parties were driven by a money motive. In subsequent films such as Any Gun Can Play (whose Italian title, \"Vado... l\\'ammazzo e torno\", is itself a quote from Leone\\'s film), One Dollar Too Many, and Kill Them All and Come Back Alone several main characters repeatedly form alliances and betray each other for monetary gain.[35]\\nSabata and If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death, directed by Gianfranco Parolini, introduce into similar betrayal environments a type of hero molded on the Mortimer character from For a Few Dollars More, only without any vengeance motive and with more outrageous trick weapons. Fittingly enough Sabata is portrayed by Lee Van Cleef himself, while John Garko plays the very similar Sartana protagonist. Parolini made some more Sabata movies, while Giuliano Carnimeo made a whole series of Sartana films with Garko.[36]\\nBeside the first three spaghetti Westerns by Leone, a most influential film was Sergio Corbucci\\'s Django starring Franco Nero. Django was one of the most violent spaghetti Westerns. The titular character is torn between several motives—money or revenge—and his choices bring misery to him and to a woman close to him. Indicative of this film\\'s influence on the spaghetti Western style, \"Django\" is the hero\\'s name in a plenitude of subsequent Westerns.[37]\\nAlthough his character is not named Django, Franco Nero brings a similar ambience to Texas, Adios and Massacre Time, in which the hero must confront surprising and dangerous family relations. Similar \"prodigal son\"[38] stories followed, including Chuck Moll, Keoma, The Return of Ringo, The Forgotten Pistolero, One Thousand Dollars on the Black, Johnny Hamlet and also Seven Dollars on the Red.[39]\\nAnother type of wronged hero is set up and must clear himself from accusations. Giuliano Gemma starred in a series of successful films carrying this theme—Adiós gringo, For a Few Extra Dollars, Long Days of Vengeance, Wanted and, to some extent, Blood for a Silver Dollar—in which his character is most often called \"Gary\".[40]\\nThe wronged hero who becomes an avenger appears in many spaghetti Westerns. Among the more commercially successful films with a hero dedicated to vengeance—For a Few Dollars More, Once Upon a Time in the West, Today We Kill... Tomorrow We Die!, A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die, Death Rides a Horse, Django, Prepare a Coffin, The Deserter, Hate for Hate, and Halleluja for Django—those with whom he cooperates typically have conflicting motivations.[41]\\nIn 1968, the wave of spaghetti Westerns reached its crest, comprising one-third of the Italian film production, only to collapse to one-tenth in 1969. However, the considerable box-office success of Enzo Barboni\\'s They Call Me Trinity and its pyramidal follow-up, Trinity Is Still My Name, gave Italian filmmakers a new model to emulate. The main characters were played by Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, who had already cooperated as a pair of heroes in three earlier spaghetti Westerns, God Forgives... I Don\\'t!, Boot Hill and Ace High, directed by Giuseppe Colizzi. The humor started in those movies, with scenes with comedy fighting, but the Barboni films became burlesque comedies. They feature the quick but lazy Trinity (Hill) and his big, strong and irritable brother, Bambino (Spencer).[42]\\nThe stories lampoon stereotypical Western characters, such as diligent farmers, lawmen and bounty hunters. There was a wave of Trinity-inspired films with quick and strong heroes, the former often called \"Trinity\", or coming from \"a place called Trinity\", and with few or no killings. Because the two model stories contained religious pacifists to account for the absence of gunplay, all of the successors contained religious groups, or, at least, priests, sometimes as one of the heroes.[43]\\nThe music for the two Trinity Westerns (composed by Franco Micalizzi and Guido & Maurizio De Angelis, respectively) also reflected the change to a lighter and more sentimental mood. The Trinity-inspired films also adopted this less serious and often-maligned style.[44]\\nSome critics deplore these post-Trinity films and their soundtracks as a degeneration of the \"real\" spaghetti Westerns. Indeed, Hill\\'s and Spencer\\'s skillful use of body language was a hard act to follow, and it is significant that the most successful of the post-Trinity films featured Hill (Man of the East and A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe), Spencer (It Can Be Done Amigo) and a pair of Hill-Spencer lookalikes in Carambola. A spaghetti Western old hand, Franco Nero, also worked in this subgenre with Cipolla Colt, and Tomas Milian plays an outrageous \"quick\" bounty hunter modeled on Charlie Chaplin\\'s Little Tramp in Sometimes Life Is Hard, Eh Providence? and Here We Go Again, Eh, Providence?.[45]\\nTerence Hill could still draw large audiences in a post-Trinity Western, My Name Is Nobody, with Henry Fonda, and a caper-story Western, A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe. The following year, Franco Nero achieved a similar draw as a Django-style hero in Keoma. However, by the end of the 1970s, the different types of spaghetti Westerns had lost their following among mainstream cinema audiences, and the production ground to a virtual halt. Belated attempts to revive the genre included the comedy film Buddy Goes West and a Spanish-American coproduction, Comin\\' at Ya!, which was shot in 3D, and Django Strikes Again.\\nSome movies that were not very successful at the box office[46] still earn a \"cult\" status in some segment of the audience because of certain extraordinary features in story and/or presentation. One \"cult\" spaghetti Western that has also drawn attention from critics is Giulio Questi\\'s Django Kill. Other \"cult\" items are Cesare Canevari\\'s Matalo!, Tony Anthony\\'s Blindman, and Joaquín Luis Romero Marchent\\'s Cut-Throats Nine (the latter among gore film audiences).\\nThe few spaghetti Westerns containing historical characters such as Buffalo Bill, Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, etc., appear mainly before A Fistful of Dollars had put its mark on the genre. Likewise, and in contrast to the contemporary German Westerns, few films feature Native Americans. When they appear, they are more often portrayed as victims of discrimination than as dangerous foes. The only fairly successful spaghetti Western with a Native American main character (played by Burt Reynolds in his only European Western outing) is Sergio Corbucci\\'s Navajo Joe, in which the (supposedly) Navajo village is wiped out by bandits during the first minutes, and the avenger hero spends the rest of the film dealing mostly with Anglos and Mexicans until the final showdown at a Native American burial ground.\\nSeveral spaghetti Westerns are inspired by classical myths and dramas. Titles, such as Fedra West (also called Ballad of a Bounty Hunter) and Johnny Hamlet, signify the connection to Greek myth, the plays by Euripides and Racine, and the play by William Shakespeare, respectively. The latter also inspired 1972\\'s Dust in the Sun, which follows the original more closely than Johnny Hamlet, in which the hero survives. The Forgotten Pistolero is based on the vengeance of Orestes. There are similarities between the story of The Return of Ringo and the last canto of Homer\\'s Odyssey. Fury of Johnny Kid follows Shakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet, but (again) with a different ending; the loving couple leave together while their families annihilate each other.\\nSome Italian Western films were made as vehicles for musical stars, such as Ferdinando Baldi\\'s Rita of the West, featuring Rita Pavone and Terence Hill. In non-singing roles were Ringo Starr as a villain in Blindman and French rock \\'n\\' roll veteran Johnny Hallyday as the gunfighter and avenger hero in Sergio Corbucci\\'s The Specialists.\\nThe story of A Fistful of Dollars was closely based on Akira Kurosawa\\'s Yojimbo. Kurosawa sued Sergio Leone for plagiarism, and was compensated with the exclusive distribution rights to the movie in Japan, where its hero, Clint Eastwood, was already a huge star due to the popularity of the TV series, Rawhide. Leone would have done far better financially by obtaining Kurosawa\\'s advance permission to use Yojimbo\\'s script.[47][48] Requiem for a Gringo shows many traces from another well-known Japanese film, Masaki Kobayashi\\'s Harakiri.\\nWhen Asian martial arts films started to draw crowds in European cinema houses, the producers of spaghetti Westerns tried to hang on, this time not by adapting storylines, but rather by directly including martial arts in the films, performed by Eastern actors—for example, Chen Lee in My Name Is Shanghai Joe, or Lo Lieh teaming up with Lee Van Cleef in The Stranger and the Gunfighter.\\nSome spaghetti Westerns incorporate political overtones, particularly from the political left. An example is Requiescant, featuring Italian author and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini as a major supporting character. Pasolini\\'s character is a priest who espouses Liberation theology. The film concerns oppression of poor Mexicans by rich Anglos, and ends on a call for arms, but it does not fit easily as a Zapata Western, for it lacks the typical hero pair of a flamboyant Latin revolutionary and an Anglo specialist. The Price of Power serves a political allegory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy and racism. The movie concerns the assassination of an American president in Dallas, Texas, by a group of Southern white supremacists who frame an innocent African-American. They are opposed by an unstable partnership between a whistleblower (Giuliano Gemma) and a political aide.\\nAlthough it is intimated in some films, such as Django Kill and Requiescant, open homosexuality plays a marginal part in spaghetti Westerns. An exception is Giorgio Capitani\\'s The Ruthless Four (in effect a gay version of John Huston\\'s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre), in which the explicit homosexual relation between two of its male main characters and some gay cueing scenes are embedded with other forms of man-to-man relations through the story.[49]\\nIn the 1960s, critics recognized that the American genres were rapidly changing. The genre most identifiably American, the Western, seemed to be evolving into a new, rougher form. For many critics, Sergio Leone\\'s films were part of the problem. Leone\\'s Dollars Trilogy (1964–1966) was not the beginning of the \"spaghetti Western\" cycle in Italy, but for some Americans, Leone\\'s films represented the true beginning of the Italian invasion of an American genre.\\nChristopher Frayling, in his noted book on the Italian Western, describes American critical reception of the spaghetti Western cycle as, to \"a large extent, confined to a sterile debate about the \\'cultural roots\\' of the American/Hollywood Western\".[50] He remarked that few critics dared admit that they were, in fact, \"bored with an exhausted Hollywood genre\".\\nFrayling noted that Pauline Kael was willing to acknowledge this critical ennui, and thus appreciate how a film like Akira Kurosawa\\'s Yojimbo \"could exploit the conventions of the Western genre, while debunking its morality\". Frayling and other film scholars, such as Bondanella, argue that this revisionism was the key to Leone\\'s success, and, to some degree, to that of the spaghetti Western genre as a whole.[51]\\nSpaghetti Westerns have left their mark on popular culture, strongly influencing numerous works produced in and outside of Italy. In later years, there were the \"return-of stories\" films Django Strikes Again with Franco Nero and Troublemakers with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. Clint Eastwood\\'s first American Western film, Hang \\'Em High, incorporates elements of spaghetti Westerns.\\nAmerican director Quentin Tarantino has utilized elements of spaghetti Westerns in his films Kill Bill (combined with kung fu movies),[52] Inglourious Basterds (set in Nazi-occupied France),[53] Django Unchained (set in the American South during the time of slavery),[54] The Hateful Eight (set in Wyoming post-US Civil War), and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (about fictional American actor Rick Dalton sometimes working in spaghetti Westerns).\\nThe Back to the Future trilogy pays homage to spaghetti Westerns (especially Sergio Leone\\'s Dollars Trilogy) on a variety of occasions, most notably in the third film. The American animated film Rango incorporates elements of spaghetti Westerns, including a character (the mystical \"Spirit of the West\", regarded as a sort of deity among the characters) appearing to the protagonist as an elderly Man with No Name. The 1985 Japanese film Tampopo was promoted as a \"ramen Western\". Japanese director Takashi Miike paid tribute to the genre with Sukiyaki Western Django, a Western set in Japan that derives influence from both Django and the Dollars Trilogy.[55]\\nThe Bollywood film Sholay was often referred to as a \"Curry Western\".[56] A more accurate genre label for the film is the \"Dacoit Western\", as it combined the conventions of Indian dacoit films, such as Mother India and Gunga Jumna, with that of spaghetti Westerns. Sholay spawned its own genre of \"Dacoit Western\" films in Bollywood during the 1970s.[57]\\nIn the Soviet Union, the spaghetti Western was adapted into the Ostern (\"Eastern\") genre of Soviet films. The Wild West setting was replaced by an Eastern setting in the steppes of the Caucasus, while Western stock characters, such as \"cowboys and Indians\", were replaced by Caucasian stock characters, such as bandits and harems. A famous example of the genre was White Sun of the Desert, which was popular in the Soviet Union.[58]\\nAmerican heavy metal band Metallica has used a Ennio Morricone\\'s composition, \"The Ecstasy of Gold\", from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, to open several of their concerts. An Australian band, the Tango Saloon, combined elements of tango music with influences from spaghetti Western scores. The band Ghoultown also derives influence from spaghetti Westerns.[59] The music video for the song \"Knights of Cydonia\", by the English rock band Muse, is influenced by spaghetti Westerns. The band Big Audio Dynamite used music samples from spaghetti Westerns when mixing their song \"Medicine Show\". Within the song, there are samples from spaghetti Western movies such as A Fistful of Dollars, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and Duck, You Sucker!.[60]\\nVideo game studio Rockstar Games utilized aspects of the spaghetti Western, and paid homage to it in their Red Dead Redemption series, as well as in its predecessor, Red Dead Revolver.[61]\\nIn 2007, a retrospective took place as part of the Venice International Film Festival to pay homage to the genre. The retrospective included 32 films:[66]\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nThe American frontier, also known as the Old West, and popularly known as the Wild West, encompasses the geography, history, folklore, and culture associated with the forward wave of American expansion in mainland North America that began with European colonial settlements in the early 17th century and ended with the admission of the last few contiguous western territories as states in 1912. This era of massive migration and settlement was particularly encouraged by President Thomas Jefferson following the Louisiana Purchase, giving rise to the expansionist attitude known as \"manifest destiny\" and historians\\' \"Frontier Thesis\". The legends, historical events and folklore of the American frontier, known as the frontier myth, have embedded themselves into United States culture so much so that the Old West, and the Western genre of media specifically, has become one of the defining features of American national identity.\\nHistorians have debated at length as to when the frontier era began, when it ended, and which were its key sub-periods.[3] For example, the Old West subperiod is sometimes used by historians regarding the time from the end of the American Civil War in 1865 to when the Superintendent of the Census, William Rush Merriam, stated the U.S. Census Bureau would stop recording western frontier settlement as part of its census categories after the 1890 U.S. Census.[8][9][10][11] His successors however continued the practice until the 1920 Census.[1][2]\\nOthers, including the Library of Congress and University of Oxford, often cite differing points reaching into the early 1900s; typically within the first two decades before American entry into World War I.[4][12] A period known as \"The Western Civil War of Incorporation\" lasted from the 1850s to 1919. This period includes historical events synonymous with the archetypical Old West or \"Wild West\" such as violent conflict arising from encroaching settlement into frontier land, the removal and assimilation of natives, consolidation of property to large corporations and government, vigilantism, and the attempted enforcement of laws upon outlaws.[13]\\nIn 1890, the Superintendent of the Census, William Rush Merriam stated: \"Up to and including 1880 the country had a frontier of settlement, but at present the unsettled area has been so broken into by isolated bodies of settlement that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line. In the discussion of its extent, its westward movement, etc., it can not, therefore, any longer have a place in the census reports.\"[14] Despite this, the later 1900 U.S. census continued to show the westward frontier line, and his successors continued the practice.[1][15] By the 1910 U.S. census however, the frontier had shrunk into divided areas without a singular westward line of settlement.[16] An influx of agricultural homesteaders in the first two decades of the 20th century, taking up more acreage than homestead grants in the entirety of the 19th century, is cited to have significantly reduced open land.[17]\\nA frontier is a zone of contact at the edge of a line of settlement. Theorist Frederick Jackson Turner went deeper, arguing that the frontier was the scene of a defining process of American civilization: \"The frontier,\" he asserted, \"promoted the formation of a composite nationality for the American people.\" He theorized it was a process of development: \"This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward...furnish[es] the forces dominating American character.\"[18] Turner\\'s ideas since 1893 have inspired generations of historians (and critics) to explore multiple individual American frontiers, but the popular folk frontier concentrates on the conquest and settlement of Native American lands west of the Mississippi River, in what is now the Midwest, Texas, the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, the Southwest, and the West Coast.\\nEnormous popular attention was focused on the Western United States (especially the Southwest) in the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, from the 1850s to the 1910s. Such media typically exaggerated the romance, anarchy, and chaotic violence of the period for greater dramatic effect. This inspired the Western genre of film, along with television shows, novels, comic books, video games, children\\'s toys, and costumes.\\nAs defined by Hine and Faragher, \"frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of crops and hotels, and the formation of states.\" They explain, \"It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.\"[19] Turner himself repeatedly emphasized how the availability of \"free land\" to start new farms attracted pioneering Americans: \"The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development.\"[20]\\nThrough treaties with foreign nations and native tribes, political compromise, military conquest, the establishment of law and order, the building of farms, ranches, and towns, the marking of trails and digging of mines, combined with successive waves of immigrants moving into the region, the United States expanded from coast to coast, fulfilling the ideology of Manifest Destiny. In his \"Frontier Thesis\" (1893), Turner theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people, the Americans, whose values focused on equality, democracy, and optimism, as well as individualism, self-reliance, and even violence.\\nThe frontier is the margin of undeveloped territory that would comprise the United States beyond the established frontier line.[21][22] The U.S. Census Bureau designated frontier territory as generally unoccupied land with a population density of fewer than 2 people per square mile (0.77 people per square kilometer). The frontier line was the outer boundary of European-American settlement into this land.[23][24] Beginning with the first permanent European settlements on the East Coast, it has moved steadily westward from the 1600s to the 1900s (decades) with occasional movements north into Maine and New Hampshire, south into Florida, and east from California into Nevada. \\nPockets of settlements would also appear far past the established frontier line, particularly on the West Coast and the deep interior, with settlements such as Los Angeles and Salt Lake City respectively. The \"West\" was the recently settled area near that boundary.[25] Thus, parts of the Midwest and American South, though no longer considered \"western\", have a frontier heritage along with the modern western states.[26][27] Richard W. Slatta, in his view of the frontier, writes that \"historians sometimes define the American West as lands west of the 98th meridian or 98° west longitude,\" and that other definitions of the region \"include all lands west of the Mississippi or Missouri rivers.\"[28]\\nKey:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0States\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Territories\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Disputed areas\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Other countries\\nIn the colonial era, before 1776, the west was of high priority for settlers and politicians. The American frontier began when Jamestown, Virginia, was settled by the English in 1607. In the earliest days of European settlement on the Atlantic coast, until about 1680, the frontier was essentially any part of the interior of the continent beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the Atlantic coast.[29]\\nEnglish, French, Spanish, and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different. Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada; these habitants settled in villages along the St. Lawrence River, building communities that remained stable for long stretches. Although French fur traders ranged widely through the Great Lakes and midwest region, they seldom settled down. French settlement was limited to a few very small villages such as Kaskaskia, Illinois[30] as well as a larger settlement around New Orleans. In what is now New York state the Dutch set up fur trading posts in the Hudson River valley, followed by large grants of land to rich landowning patroons who brought in tenant farmers who created compact, permanent villages. They created a dense rural settlement in upstate New York, but they did not push westward.[31]\\nAreas in the north that were in the frontier stage by 1700 generally had poor transportation facilities, so the opportunity for commercial agriculture was low. These areas remained primarily in subsistence agriculture, and as a result, by the 1760s these societies were highly egalitarian, as explained by historian Jackson Turner Main:\\nThe typical frontier society, therefore, was one in which class distinctions were minimized. The wealthy speculator, if one was involved, usually remained at home, so that ordinarily no one of wealth was a resident. The class of landless poor was small. The great majority were landowners, most of whom were also poor because they were starting with little property and had not yet cleared much land nor had they acquired the farm tools and animals which would one day make them prosperous. Few artisans settled on the frontier except for those who practiced a trade to supplement their primary occupation of farming. There might be a storekeeper, a minister, and perhaps a doctor; and there were several landless laborers. All the rest were farmers.[32]In the South, frontier areas that lacked transportation, such as the Appalachian Mountains region, remained based on subsistence farming and resembled the egalitarianism of their northern counterparts, although they had a larger upper-class of slaveowners. North Carolina was representative. However, frontier areas of 1700 that had good river connections were increasingly transformed into plantation agriculture. Rich men came in, bought up the good land, and worked it with slaves. The area was no longer \"frontier\". It had a stratified society comprising a powerful upper-class white landowning gentry, a small middle-class, a fairly large group of landless or tenant white farmers, and a growing slave population at the bottom of the social pyramid. Unlike the North, where small towns and even cities were common, the South was overwhelmingly rural.[33]\\n\\nThe seaboard colonial settlements gave priority to land ownership for individual farmers, and as the population grew they pushed westward for fresh farmland.[34] Unlike Britain, where a small number of landlords owned most of the land, ownership in America was cheap, easy and widespread. Land ownership brought a degree of independence as well as a vote for local and provincial offices. The typical New England settlements were quite compact and small, under a square mile. Conflict with the Native Americans arose out of political issues, namely who would rule.[35] Early frontier areas east of the Appalachian Mountains included the Connecticut River valley,[36] and northern New England (which was a move to the north, not the west).[37]\\nSettlers on the frontier often connected isolated incidents to indicate Indian conspiracies to attack them, but these lacked a French diplomatic dimension after 1763, or a Spanish connection after 1820.[38]\\nMost of the frontiers experienced numerous conflicts.[39] The French and Indian War broke out between Britain and France, with the French making up for their small colonial population base by enlisting Native war parties as allies. The series of large wars spilling over from European wars ended in a complete victory for the British in the worldwide Seven Years\\' War. In the peace treaty of 1763, France ceded practically everything, as the lands west of the Mississippi River, in addition to Florida and New Orleans, went to Spain. Otherwise, lands east of the Mississippi River and what is now Canada went to Britain.[citation needed]\\nRegardless of wars, Americans were moving across the Appalachians into western Pennsylvania, what is now West Virginia, and areas of the Ohio Country, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In the southern settlements via the Cumberland Gap, their most famous leader was Daniel Boone.[40] Young George Washington promoted settlements in West Virginia on lands awarded to him and his soldiers by the Royal government in payment for their wartime service in Virginia\\'s militia. Settlements west of the Appalachian Mountains were curtailed briefly by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, forbidding settlement in this area. The Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) re-opened most of the western lands for frontiersmen to settle.[41]\\nThe nation was at peace after 1783. The states gave Congress control of the western lands and an effective system for population expansion was developed. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 abolished slavery in the area north of the Ohio River and promised statehood when a territory reached a threshold population, as Ohio did in 1803.[42][43]\\nThe first major movement west of the Appalachian mountains originated in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina as soon as the Revolutionary War ended in 1781. Pioneers housed themselves in a rough lean-to or at most a one-room log cabin. The main food supply at first came from hunting deer, turkeys, and other abundant game.\\nClad in typical frontier garb, leather breeches, moccasins, fur cap, and hunting shirt, and girded by a belt from which hung a hunting knife and a shot pouch—all homemade—the pioneer presented a unique appearance. In a short time he opened in the woods a patch, or clearing, on which he grew corn, wheat, flax, tobacco, and other products, even fruit.[44]In a few years, the pioneer added hogs, sheep, and cattle, and perhaps acquired a horse. Homespun clothing replaced the animal skins. The more restless pioneers grew dissatisfied with over civilized life and uprooted themselves again to move 50 or a hundred miles (80 or 160\\xa0km) further west.\\nThe land policy of the new nation was conservative, paying special attention to the needs of the settled East.[45] The goals sought by both parties in the 1790–1820 era were to grow the economy, avoid draining away the skilled workers needed in the East, distribute the land wisely, sell it at prices that were reasonable to settlers yet high enough to pay off the national debt, clear legal titles, and create a diversified Western economy that would be closely interconnected with the settled areas with minimal risk of a breakaway movement. By the 1830s, however, the West was filling up with squatters who had no legal deed, although they may have paid money to previous settlers. The Jacksonian Democrats favored the squatters by promising rapid access to cheap land. By contrast, Henry Clay was alarmed at the \"lawless rabble\" heading West who were undermining the utopian concept of a law-abiding, stable middle-class republican community. Rich southerners, meanwhile, looked for opportunities to buy high-quality land to set up slave plantations. The Free Soil movement of the 1840s called for low-cost land for free white farmers, a position enacted into law by the new Republican Party in 1862, offering free 160 acres (65\\xa0ha) homesteads to all adults, male and female, black and white, native-born or immigrant.[46]\\nAfter winning the Revolutionary War (1783), American settlers in large numbers poured into the west. In 1788, American pioneers to the Northwest Territory established Marietta, Ohio, as the first permanent American settlement in the Northwest Territory.[47]\\nIn 1775, Daniel Boone blazed a trail for the Transylvania Company from Virginia through the Cumberland Gap into central Kentucky. It was later lengthened to reach the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville. The Wilderness Road was steep and rough, and it could only be traversed on foot or horseback, but it was the best route for thousands of settlers moving into Kentucky.[48] In some areas they had to face Native attacks. In 1784 alone, Natives killed over 100 travelers on the Wilderness Road. Kentucky at this time had been depopulated—it was \"empty of Indian villages.\"[49] However raiding parties sometimes came through. One of those intercepted was Abraham Lincoln\\'s grandfather, who was scalped in 1784 near Louisville.[50]\\nThe War of 1812 marked the final confrontation involving major British and Native forces fighting to stop American expansion. The British war goal included the creation of an Indian barrier state under British auspices in the Midwest which would halt American expansion westward. American frontier militiamen under General Andrew Jackson defeated the Creeks and opened the Southwest, while militia under Governor William Henry Harrison defeated the Native-British alliance at the Battle of the Thames in Canada in 1813. The death in battle of the Native leader Tecumseh dissolved the coalition of hostile Native tribes.[51] Meanwhile, General Andrew Jackson ended the Native military threat in the Southeast at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814 in Alabama. In general, the frontiersmen battled the Natives with little help from the U.S. Army or the federal government.[52]\\nTo end the war, American diplomats negotiated the Treaty of Ghent, signed towards the end of 1814, with Britain. They rejected the British plan to set up a Native state in U.S. territory south of the Great Lakes. They explained the American policy toward the acquisition of Native lands:\\nThe United States, while intending never to acquire lands from the Indians otherwise than peaceably, and with their free consent, are fully determined, in that manner, progressively, and in proportion as their growing population may require, to reclaim from the state of nature, and to bring into cultivation every portion of the territory contained within their acknowledged boundaries. In thus providing for the support of millions of civilized beings, they will not violate any dictate of justice or humanity; for they will not only give to the few thousand savages scattered over that territory an ample equivalent for any right they may surrender, but will always leave them the possession of lands more than they can cultivate, and more than adequate to their subsistence, comfort, and enjoyment, by cultivation. If this is a spirit of aggrandizement, the undersigned are prepared to admit, in that sense, its existence; but they must deny that it affords the slightest proof of an intention not to respect the boundaries between them and European nations, or of a desire to encroach upon the territories of Great Britain. [...] They will not suppose that that Government will avow, as the basis of their policy towards the United States a system of arresting their natural growth within their territories, for the sake of preserving a perpetual desert for savages.[53]As settlers poured in, the frontier districts first became territories, with an elected legislature and a governor appointed by the president. Then when the population reached 100,000 the territory applied for statehood.[54] Frontiersmen typically dropped the legalistic formalities and restrictive franchise favored by eastern upper classes and adopting more democracy and more egalitarianism.[55]\\nIn 1810, the western frontier had reached the Mississippi River. St. Louis, Missouri, was the largest town on the frontier, the gateway for travel westward, and a principal trading center for Mississippi River traffic and inland commerce but remained under Spanish control until 1803.\\nThomas Jefferson thought of himself as a man of the frontier and was keenly interested in expanding and exploring the West.[56] Jefferson\\'s Louisiana Purchase of 1803 doubled the size of the nation at the cost of $15\\xa0million, or about $0.04 per acre ($305\\xa0million in 2023 dollars, less than 42 cents per acre).[57] Federalists opposed the expansion, but Jeffersonians hailed the opportunity to create millions of new farms to expand the domain of land-owning yeomen; the ownership would strengthen the ideal republican society, based on agriculture (not commerce), governed lightly, and promoting self-reliance and virtue, as well as form the political base for Jeffersonian Democracy.[58]\\nFrance was paid for its sovereignty over the territory in terms of international law. Between 1803 and the 1870s, the federal government purchased the land from the Native tribes then in possession of it. 20th-century accountants and courts have calculated the value of the payments made to the Natives, which included future payments of cash, food, horses, cattle, supplies, buildings, schooling, and medical care. In cash terms, the total paid to the tribes in the area of the Louisiana Purchase amounted to about $2.6\\xa0billion, or nearly $9\\xa0billion in 2016 dollars. Additional sums were paid to the Natives living east of the Mississippi for their lands, as well as payments to Natives living in parts of the west outside the Louisiana Purchase.[59]\\nEven before the purchase, Jefferson was planning expeditions to explore and map the lands. He charged Lewis and Clark to \"explore the Missouri River, and such principal stream of it, as, by its course and communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean; whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colorado, or any other river may offer the most direct and practicable communication across the continent for commerce\".[60] Jefferson also instructed the expedition to study the region\\'s native tribes (including their morals, language, and culture), weather, soil, rivers, commercial trading, and animal and plant life.[61]\\nEntrepreneurs, most notably John Jacob Astor quickly seized the opportunity and expanded fur trading operations into the Pacific Northwest. Astor\\'s \"Fort Astoria\" (later Fort George), at the mouth of the Columbia River, became the first permanent white settlement in that area, although it was not profitable for Astor. He set up the American Fur Company in an attempt to break the hold that the Hudson\\'s Bay Company monopoly had over the region. By 1820, Astor had taken over independent traders to create a profitable monopoly; he left the business as a multi-millionaire in 1834.[62]\\nAs the frontier moved west, trappers and hunters moved ahead of settlers, searching out new supplies of beaver and other skins for shipment to Europe. The hunters were the first Europeans in much of the Old West and they formed the first working relationships with the Native Americans in the West.[63][64] They added extensive knowledge of the Northwest terrain, including the important South Pass through the central Rocky Mountains. Discovered about 1812, it later became a major route for settlers to Oregon and Washington. By 1820, however, a new \"brigade-rendezvous\" system sent company men in \"brigades\" cross-country on long expeditions, bypassing many tribes. It also encouraged \"free trappers\" to explore new regions on their own. At the end of the gathering season, the trappers would \"rendezvous\" and turn in their goods for pay at river ports along the Green River, Upper Missouri, and the Upper Mississippi. St. Louis was the largest of the rendezvous towns. By 1830, however, fashions changed and beaver hats were replaced by silk hats, ending the demand for expensive American furs. Thus ended the era of the mountain men, trappers, and scouts such as Jedediah Smith, Hugh Glass, Davy Crockett, Jack Omohundro, and others. The trade in beaver fur virtually ceased by 1845.[65]\\nThere was wide agreement on the need to settle the new territories quickly, but the debate polarized over the price the government should charge. The conservatives and Whigs, typified by the president John Quincy Adams, wanted a moderated pace that charged the newcomers enough to pay the costs of the federal government. The Democrats, however, tolerated a wild scramble for land at very low prices. The final resolution came in the Homestead Law of 1862, with a moderated pace that gave settlers 160 acres free after they worked on it for five years.[66]\\nThe private profit motive dominated the movement westward,[67] but the federal government played a supporting role in securing the land through treaties and setting up territorial governments, with governors appointed by the President. The federal government first acquired western territory through treaties with other nations or native tribes. Then it sent surveyors to map and document the land.[68] By the 20th century, Washington bureaucracies managed the federal lands such as the United States General Land Office in the Interior Department,[69] and after 1891, the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture.[70] After 1900, dam building and flood control became major concerns.[71]\\nTransportation was a key issue and the Army (especially the Army Corps of Engineers) was given full responsibility for facilitating navigation on the rivers. The steamboat, first used on the Ohio River in 1811, made possible inexpensive travel using the river systems, especially the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and their tributaries.[72] Army expeditions up the Missouri River in 1818–1825 allowed engineers to improve the technology. For example, the Army\\'s steamboat \"Western Engineer\" of 1819 combined a very shallow draft with one of the earliest stern wheels. In 1819–1825, Colonel Henry Atkinson developed keelboats with hand-powered paddle wheels.[73]\\nThe federal postal system played a crucial role in national expansion. It facilitated expansion into the West by creating an inexpensive, fast, convenient communication system. Letters from early settlers provided information and boosterism to encourage increased migration to the West, helped scattered families stay in touch and provide neutral help, assisted entrepreneurs to find business opportunities, and made possible regular commercial relationships between merchants and the West and wholesalers and factories back east. The postal service likewise assisted the Army in expanding control over the vast western territories. The widespread circulation of important newspapers by mail, such as the New York Weekly Tribune, facilitated coordination among politicians in different states. The postal service helped to integrate already established areas with the frontier, creating a spirit of nationalism and providing a necessary infrastructure.[74]\\nThe army early on assumed the mission of protecting settlers along with the Westward Expansion Trails, a policy that was described by U.S. Secretary of War John B. Floyd in 1857:[75]\\nA line of posts running parallel without frontier, but near to the Indians\\' usual habitations, placed at convenient distances and suitable positions, and occupied by infantry, would exercise a salutary restraint upon the tribes, who would feel that any foray by their warriors upon the white settlements would meet with prompt retaliation upon their own homes.There was a debate at the time about the best size for the forts with Jefferson Davis, Winfield Scott, and Thomas Jesup supporting forts that were larger but fewer in number than Floyd. Floyd\\'s plan was more expensive but had the support of settlers and the general public who preferred that the military remain as close as possible. The frontier area was vast and even Davis conceded that \"concentration would have exposed portions of the frontier to Native hostilities without any protection.\"[75]\\nGovernment and private enterprise sent many explorers to the West. In 1805–1806, Army lieutenant Zebulon Pike (1779–1813) led a party of 20 soldiers to find the headwaters of the Mississippi. He later explored the Red and Arkansas Rivers in Spanish territory, eventually reaching the Rio Grande. On his return, Pike sighted the peak in Colorado named after him.[76] Major Stephen Harriman Long (1784–1864)[77] led the Yellowstone and Missouri expeditions of 1819–1820, but his categorizing in 1823 of the Great Plains as arid and useless led to the region getting a bad reputation as the \"Great American Desert\", which discouraged settlement in that area for several decades.[78]\\nIn 1811, naturalists Thomas Nuttall (1786–1859) and John Bradbury (1768–1823) traveled up the Missouri River documenting and drawing plant and animal life.[79] Artist George Catlin (1796–1872) painted accurate paintings of Native American culture. Swiss artist Karl Bodmer made compelling landscapes and portraits.[80] John James Audubon (1785–1851) is famous for classifying and painting in minute details 500 species of birds, published in Birds of America.[81]\\nThe most famous of the explorers was John Charles Frémont (1813–1890), an Army officer in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. He displayed a talent for exploration and a genius at self-promotion that gave him the sobriquet of \"Pathmarker of the West\" and led him to the presidential nomination of the new Republican Party in 1856.[82] He led a series of expeditions in the 1840s which answered many of the outstanding geographic questions about the little-known region. He crossed through the Rocky Mountains by five different routes and mapped parts of Oregon and California. In 1846–1847, he played a role in conquering California. In 1848–1849, Frémont was assigned to locate a central route through the mountains for the proposed transcontinental railroad, but his expedition ended in near-disaster when it became lost and was trapped by heavy snow.[83] His reports mixed narrative of exciting adventure with scientific data and detailed practical information for travelers. It caught the public imagination and inspired many to head west. Goetzman says it was \"monumental in its breadth, a classic of exploring literature\".[84]\\nWhile colleges were springing up across the Northeast, there was little competition on the western frontier for Transylvania University, founded in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1780. It boasted of a law school in addition to its undergraduate and medical programs. Transylvania attracted politically ambitious young men from across the Southwest, including 50 who became United States senators, 101 representatives, 36 governors, and 34 ambassadors, as well as Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy.[85]\\nMost frontiersmen showed little commitment to religion until traveling evangelists began to appear and to produce \"revivals\". The local pioneers responded enthusiastically to these events and, in effect, evolved their populist religions, especially during the Second Great Awakening (1790–1840), which featured outdoor camp meetings lasting a week or more and which introduced many people to organized religion for the first time. One of the largest and most famous camp meetings took place at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, in 1801.[86]\\nThe local Baptists set up small independent churches—Baptists abjured centralized authority; each local church was founded on the principle of independence of the local congregation. On the other hand, bishops of the well-organized, centralized Methodists assigned circuit riders to specific areas for several years at a time, then moved them to fresh territory. Several new denominations were formed, of which the largest was the Disciples of Christ.[87][88][89]\\nThe established Eastern churches were slow to meet the needs of the frontier. The Presbyterians and Congregationalists, since they depended on well-educated ministers, were shorthanded in evangelizing the frontier. They set up a Plan of Union of 1801 to combine resources on the frontier.[90][91]\\nHistorian Mark Wyman calls Wisconsin a \"palimpsest\" of layer upon layer of peoples and forces, each imprinting permanent influences. He identified these layers as multiple \"frontiers\" over three centuries: Native American frontier, French frontier, English frontier, fur-trade frontier, mining frontier, and the logging frontier. Finally, the coming of the railroad brought the end of the frontier.[92]\\nFrederick Jackson Turner grew up in Wisconsin during its last frontier stage, and in his travels around the state, he could see the layers of social and political development. One of Turner\\'s last students, Merle Curti used an in-depth analysis of local Wisconsin history to test Turner\\'s thesis about democracy. Turner\\'s view was that American democracy, \"involved widespread participation in the making of decisions affecting the common life, the development of initiative and self-reliance, and equality of economic and cultural opportunity. It thus also involved Americanization of immigrant.\"[93] Curti found that from 1840 to 1860 in Wisconsin the poorest groups gained rapidly in land ownership, and often rose to political leadership at the local level. He found that even landless young farmworkers were soon able to obtain their farms. Free land on the frontier, therefore, created opportunity and democracy, for both European immigrants as well as old stock Yankees.[94]\\nFrom the 1770s to the 1830s, pioneers moved into the new lands that stretched from Kentucky to Alabama to Texas. Most were farmers who moved in family groups.[95]\\nHistorian Louis Hacker shows how wasteful the first generation of pioneers was; they were too ignorant to cultivate the land properly and when the natural fertility of virgin land was used up, they sold out and moved west to try again. Hacker describes that in Kentucky about 1812:\\nFarms were for sale with from ten to fifty acres cleared, possessing log houses, peach and sometimes apple orchards, enclosed in fences, and having plenty of standing timber for fuel. The land was sown in wheat and corn, which were the staples, while hemp [for making rope] was being cultivated in increasing quantities in the fertile river bottoms....\\nYet, on the whole, it was an agricultural society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize wasteful and ignorant husbandry. Grass seed was not sown for hay and as a result, the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests; the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage; a single crop was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted; the manure was not returned to the fields; only a small part of the farm was brought under cultivation, the rest being permitted to stand in timber. Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on. Hunger was the goad. The pioneer farmer\\'s ignorance, his inadequate facilities for cultivation, his limited means, of transport necessitated his frequent changes of scene. He could succeed only with virgin soil.[96]Hacker adds that the second wave of settlers reclaimed the land, repaired the damage, and practiced more sustainable agriculture. Historian Frederick Jackson Turner explored the individualistic worldview and values of the first generation:\\nWhat they objected to was arbitrary obstacles, artificial limitations upon the freedom of each member of this frontier folk to work out his career without fear or favor. What they instinctively opposed was the crystallization of differences, the monopolization of opportunity, and the fixing of that monopoly by government or by social customs. The road must be open. The game must be played according to the rules. There must be no artificial stifling of equality of opportunity, no closed doors to the able, no stopping the free game before it was played to the end. More than that, there was an unformulated, perhaps, but very real feeling, that mere success in the game, by which the abler men were able to achieve preëminence gave to the successful ones no right to look down upon their neighbors, no vested title to assert superiority as a matter of pride and to the diminution of the equal right and dignity of the less successful.[97]Manifest Destiny was the controversial belief that the United States was preordained to expand from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast, and efforts made to realize that belief. The concept has appeared during colonial times, but the term was coined in the 1840s by a popular magazine which editorialized, \"the fulfillment of our manifest destiny...to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions.\" As the nation grew, \"Manifest Destiny\" became a rallying cry for expansionists in the Democratic Party. In the 1840s, the Tyler and Polk administrations (1841–1849) successfully promoted this nationalistic doctrine. However, the Whig Party, which represented business and financial interests, stood opposed to Manifest Destiny. Whig leaders such as Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln called for deepening the society through modernization and urbanization instead of simple horizontal expansion.[98] Starting with the annexation of Texas, the expansionists got the upper hand. John Quincy Adams, an anti-slavery Whig, felt the Texas annexation in 1845 to be \"the heaviest calamity that ever befell myself and my country\".[99]\\nHelping settlers move westward were the emigrant \"guide books\" of the 1840s featuring route information supplied by the fur traders and the Frémont expeditions, and promising fertile farmland beyond the Rockies.[nb 1]\\nMexico became independent of Spain in 1821 and took over Spain\\'s northern possessions stretching from Texas to California. American caravans began delivering goods to the Mexican city Santa Fe along the Santa Fe Trail, over the 870-mile (1,400\\xa0km) journey which took 48 days from Kansas City, Missouri (then known as Westport). Santa Fe was also the trailhead for the \"El Camino Real\" (the King\\'s Highway), a trade route which carried American manufactured goods southward deep into Mexico and returned silver, furs, and mules northward (not to be confused with another \"Camino Real\" which connected the missions in California). A branch also ran eastward near the Gulf (also called the Old San Antonio Road). Santa Fe connected to California via the Old Spanish Trail.[100][101]\\nThe Spanish and Mexican governments attracted American settlers to Texas with generous terms. Stephen F. Austin became an \"empresario\", receiving contracts from the Mexican officials to bring in immigrants. In doing so, he also became the de facto political and military commander of the area. Tensions rose, however, after an abortive attempt to establish the independent nation of Fredonia in 1826. William Travis, leading the \"war party\", advocated for independence from Mexico, while the \"peace party\" led by Austin attempted to get more autonomy within the current relationship. When Mexican president Santa Anna shifted alliances and joined the conservative Centralist party, he declared himself dictator and ordered soldiers into Texas to curtail new immigration and unrest. However, immigration continued and 30,000 Anglos with 3,000 slaves were settled in Texas by 1835.[102] In 1836, the Texas Revolution erupted. Following losses at the Alamo and Goliad, the Texians won the decisive Battle of San Jacinto to secure independence. At San Jacinto, Sam Houston, commander-in-chief of the Texian Army and future President of the Republic of Texas famously shouted \"Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad\". The U.S. Congress declined to annex Texas, stalemated by contentious arguments over slavery and regional power. Thus, the Republic of Texas remained an independent power for nearly a decade before it was annexed as the 28th state in 1845. The government of Mexico, however, viewed Texas as a runaway province and asserted its ownership.[103]\\nMexico refused to recognize the independence of Texas in 1836, but the U.S. and European powers did so. Mexico threatened war if Texas joined the U.S., which it did in 1845. American negotiators were turned away by a Mexican government in turmoil. When the Mexican army killed 16 American soldiers in disputed territory war was at hand. Whigs such as Congressman Abraham Lincoln denounced the war, but it was quite popular outside New England.[104]\\nThe Mexican strategy was defensive; the American strategy was a three-pronged offensive, using large numbers of volunteer soldiers.[105] Overland forces seized New Mexico with little resistance and headed to California, which quickly fell to the American land and naval forces. From the main American base at New Orleans, General Zachary Taylor led forces into northern Mexico, winning a series of battles that ensued. The U.S. Navy transported General Winfield Scott to Veracruz. He then marched his 12,000-man force west to Mexico City, winning the final battle at Chapultepec. Talk of acquiring all of Mexico fell away when the army discovered the Mexican political and cultural values were so alien to America\\'s. As the Cincinnati Herald asked, what would the U.S. do with eight million Mexicans \"with their idol worship, heathen superstition, and degraded mongrel races?\"[106]\\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848 ceded the territories of California and New Mexico to the United States for $18.5\\xa0million (which included the assumption of claims against Mexico by settlers). The Gadsden Purchase in 1853 added southern Arizona, which was needed for a railroad route to California. In all Mexico ceded half a million square miles (1.3\\xa0million km2) and included the states-to-be of California, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming, in addition to Texas. Managing the new territories and dealing with the slavery issue caused intense controversy, particularly over the Wilmot Proviso, which would have outlawed slavery in the new territories. Congress never passed it, but rather temporarily resolved the issue of slavery in the West with the Compromise of 1850. California entered the Union in 1850 as a free state; the other areas remained territories for many years.[107][108]\\nThe new state grew rapidly as migrants poured into the fertile cotton lands of east Texas.[109] German immigrants started to arrive in the early 1840s because of negative economic, social, and political pressures in Germany.[110] With their investments in cotton lands and slaves, planters established cotton plantations in the eastern districts. The central area of the state was developed more by subsistence farmers who seldom owned slaves.[111]\\nTexas in its Wild West days attracted men who could shoot straight and possessed the zest for adventure, \"for masculine renown, patriotic service, martial glory, and meaningful deaths\".[112]\\nIn 1846, about 10,000 Californios (Hispanics) lived in California, primarily on cattle ranches in what is now the Los Angeles area. A few hundred foreigners were scattered in the northern districts, including some Americans. With the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846 the U.S. sent in Frémont and a U.S. Army unit, as well as naval forces, and quickly took control.[113] As the war was ending, gold was discovered in the north, and the word soon spread worldwide.\\nThousands of \"Forty-Niners\" reached California, by sailing around South America (or taking a short-cut through disease-ridden Panama), or walked the California trail. The population soared to over 200,000 in 1852, mostly in the gold districts that stretched into the mountains east of San Francisco.\\nHousing in San Francisco was at a premium, and abandoned ships whose crews had headed for the mines were often converted to temporary lodging. In the goldfields themselves, living conditions were primitive, though the mild climate proved attractive. Supplies were expensive and food poor, typical diets consisting mostly of pork, beans, and whiskey. These highly male, transient communities with no established institutions were prone to high levels of violence, drunkenness, profanity, and greed-driven behavior. Without courts or law officers in the mining communities to enforce claims and justice, miners developed their ad hoc legal system, based on the \"mining codes\" used in other mining communities abroad. Each camp had its own rules and often handed out justice by popular vote, sometimes acting fairly and at times exercising vigilantes; with Native Americans (Indians), Mexicans, and Chinese generally receiving the harshest sentences.[114]\\nThe gold rush radically changed the California economy and brought in an array of professionals, including precious metal specialists, merchants, doctors, and attorneys, who added to the population of miners, saloon keepers, gamblers, and prostitutes. A San Francisco newspaper stated, \"The whole country... resounds to the sordid cry of gold! Gold! Gold! while the field is left half planted, the house half-built, and everything neglected but the manufacture of shovels and pickaxes.\"[115] Over 250,000 miners found a total of more than $200\\xa0million in gold in the five years of the California Gold Rush.[116][117] As thousands arrived, however, fewer and fewer miners struck their fortune, and most ended exhausted and broke.\\nViolent bandits often preyed upon the miners, such as the case of Jonathan R. Davis\\' killing of eleven bandits single-handedly.[118] Camps spread out north and south of the American River and eastward into the Sierras. In a few years, nearly all of the independent miners were displaced as mines were purchased and run by mining companies, who then hired low-paid salaried miners. As gold became harder to find and more difficult to extract, individual prospectors gave way to paid work gangs, specialized skills, and mining machinery. Bigger mines, however, caused greater environmental damage. In the mountains, shaft mining predominated, producing large amounts of waste. Beginning in 1852, at the end of the \\'49 gold rush, through 1883, hydraulic mining was used. Despite huge profits being made, it fell into the hands of a few capitalists, displaced numerous miners, vast amounts of waste entered river systems, and did heavy ecological damage to the environment. Hydraulic mining ended when the public outcry over the destruction of farmlands led to the outlawing of this practice.[119]\\nThe mountainous areas of the triangle from New Mexico to California to South Dakota contained hundreds of hard rock mining sites, where prospectors discovered gold, silver, copper and other minerals (as well as some soft-rock coal). Temporary mining camps sprang up overnight; most became ghost towns when the ores were depleted. Prospectors spread out and hunted for gold and silver along the Rockies and in the southwest. Soon gold was discovered in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, and South Dakota (by 1864).\\n[120]\\nThe discovery of the Comstock Lode, containing vast amounts of silver, resulted in the Nevada boomtowns of Virginia City, Carson City, and Silver City. The wealth from silver, more than from gold, fueled the maturation of San Francisco in the 1860s and helped the rise of some of its wealthiest families, such as that of George Hearst.[121]\\nTo get to the rich new lands of the West Coast, there were three options: some sailed around the southern tip of South America during a six-month voyage, some took the treacherous journey across the Panama Isthmus, but 400,000 others walked there on an overland route of more than 2,000 miles (3,200\\xa0km); their wagon trains usually left from Missouri. They moved in large groups under an experienced wagonmaster, bringing their clothing, farm supplies, weapons, and animals. These wagon trains followed major rivers, crossed prairies and mountains, and typically ended in Oregon and California. Pioneers generally attempted to complete the journey during a single warm season, usually for six months. By 1836, when the first migrant wagon train was organized in Independence, Missouri, a wagon trail had been cleared to Fort Hall, Idaho. Trails were cleared further and further west, eventually reaching the Willamette Valley in Oregon. This network of wagon trails leading to the Pacific Northwest was later called the Oregon Trail. The eastern half of the route was also used by travelers on the California Trail (from 1843), Mormon Trail (from 1847), and Bozeman Trail (from 1863) before they turned off to their separate destinations.[122]\\nIn the \"Wagon Train of 1843\", some 700 to 1,000 emigrants headed for Oregon; missionary Marcus Whitman led the wagons on the last leg. In 1846, the Barlow Road was completed around Mount Hood, providing a rough but passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley: about 2,000 miles (3,200\\xa0km).[123] Though the main direction of travel on the early wagon trails was westward, people also used the Oregon Trail to travel eastward. Some did so because they were discouraged and defeated. Some returned with bags of gold and silver. Most were returning to pick up their families and move them all back west. These \"gobacks\" were a major source of information and excitement about the wonders and promises—and dangers and disappointments—of the far West.[124]\\nNot all emigrants made it to their destination. The dangers of the overland route were numerous: snakebites, wagon accidents, violence from other travelers, suicide, malnutrition, stampedes, Native attacks, a variety of diseases (dysentery, typhoid, and cholera were among the most common), exposure, avalanches, etc. One particularly well-known example of the treacherous nature of the journey is the story of the ill-fated Donner Party, which became trapped in the Sierra Nevada mountains during the winter of 1846–1847. Half of the 90 people traveling with the group died from starvation and exposure, and some resorted to cannibalism to survive.[125] Another story of cannibalism featured Alferd Packer and his trek to Colorado in 1874. There were also frequent attacks from bandits and highwaymen, such as the infamous Harpe brothers who patrolled the frontier routes and targeted migrant groups.[126][127]\\nIn Missouri and Illinois, animosity between the Mormon settlers and locals grew, which would mirror those in other states such as Utah years later. Violence finally erupted on October 24, 1838, when militias from both sides clashed and a mass killing of Mormons in Livingston County occurred 6 days later.[128] A Mormon Extermination Order was filed during these conflicts, and the Mormons were forced to scatter.[129] Brigham Young, seeking to leave American jurisdiction to escape religious persecution in Illinois and Missouri, led the Mormons to the valley of the Great Salt Lake, owned at the time by Mexico but not controlled by them. A hundred rural Mormon settlements sprang up in what Young called \"Deseret\", which he ruled as a theocracy. It later became Utah Territory. Young\\'s Salt Lake City settlement served as the hub of their network, which reached into neighboring territories as well. The communalism and advanced farming practices of the Mormons enabled them to succeed.[130] The Mormons often sold goods to wagon trains passing through and came to terms with local Native tribes because Young decided it was cheaper to feed the Natives than fight them.[131] Education became a high priority to protect the beleaguered group, reduce heresy and maintain group solidarity.[132]\\nFollowing the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, Utah was ceded to the United States by Mexico. Though the Mormons in Utah had supported U.S. efforts during the war; the federal government, pushed by the Protestant churches, rejected theocracy and polygamy. Founded in 1852, the Republican Party was openly hostile towards the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Utah over the practice of polygamy, viewed by most of the American public as an affront to religious, cultural, and moral values of modern civilization. Confrontations verged on open warfare in the late 1850s as President Buchanan sent in troops. Although there were no military battles fought, and negotiations led to a stand down, violence still escalated and there were several casualties.[133] After the Civil War, the federal government systematically took control of Utah, the LDS Church was legally disincorporated in the territory and members of the church\\'s hierarchy, including Young, were summarily removed and barred from virtually every public office.[134] Meanwhile, successful missionary work in the U.S. and Europe brought a flood of Mormon converts to Utah. During this time, Congress refused to admit Utah into the Union as a state and statehood would mean an end to direct federal control over the territory and the possible ascension of politicians chosen and controlled by the LDS Church into most if not all federal, state and local elected offices from the new state. Finally, in 1890, the church leadership announced polygamy was no longer a central tenet, thereafter a compromise. In 1896, Utah was admitted as the 45th state with the Mormons dividing between Republicans and Democrats.[135]\\nThe federal government provided subsidies for the development of mail and freight delivery, and by 1856, Congress authorized road improvements and an overland mail service to California. The new commercial wagon trains service primarily hauled freight. In 1858 John Butterfield (1801–1869) established a stage service that went from Saint Louis to San Francisco in 24 days along a southern route. This route was abandoned in 1861 after Texas joined the Confederacy, in favor of stagecoach services established via Fort Laramie and Salt Lake City, a 24-day journey, with Wells Fargo & Co. as the foremost provider (initially using the old \"Butterfield\" name).[136]\\nWilliam Russell, hoping to get a government contract for more rapid mail delivery service, started the Pony Express in 1860, cutting delivery time to ten days. He set up over 150 stations about 15 miles (24\\xa0km) apart.\\nIn 1861, Congress passed the Land-Grant Telegraph Act which financed the construction of Western Union\\'s transcontinental telegraph lines. Hiram Sibley, Western Union\\'s head, negotiated exclusive agreements with railroads to run telegraph lines along their right-of-way. Eight years before the transcontinental railroad opened, the first transcontinental telegraph linked Omaha, Nebraska, to San Francisco on October 24, 1861.[137] The Pony Express ended in just 18 months because it could not compete with the telegraph.[138][139]\\nConstitutionally, Congress could not deal with slavery in the states but it did have jurisdiction in the western territories. California unanimously rejected slavery in 1850 and became a free state. New Mexico allowed slavery, but it was rarely seen there. Kansas was off-limits to slavery by the Compromise of 1820. Free Soil elements feared that if slavery were allowed rich planters would buy up the best lands and work them with gangs of slaves, leaving little opportunity for free white men to own farms. Few Southern planters were interested in Kansas, but the idea that slavery was illegal there implied they had a second-class status that was intolerable to their sense of honor, and seemed to violate the principle of states\\' rights. With the passage of the extremely controversial Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854, Congress left the decision up to the voters on the ground in Kansas. Across the North, a new major party was formed to fight slavery: the Republican Party, with numerous westerners in leadership positions, most notably Abraham Lincoln of Illinois. To influence the territorial decision, anti-slavery elements (also called \"Jayhawkers\" or \"Free-soilers\") financed the migration of politically determined settlers. But pro-slavery advocates fought back with pro-slavery settlers from Missouri.[140] Violence on both sides was the result; in all 56 men were killed by the time the violence abated in 1859.[141] By 1860 the pro-slavery forces were in control—but Kansas had only two slaves. The antislavery forces took over by 1861, as Kansas became a free state. The episode demonstrated that a democratic compromise between North and South over slavery was impossible and served to hasten the Civil War.[142]\\nDespite its large territory, the trans-Mississippi West had a small population and its wartime story has to a large extent been underplayed in the historiography of the American Civil War.[143]\\nThe Confederacy engaged in several important campaigns in the West. However, Kansas, a major area of conflict building up to the war, was the scene of only one battle, at Mine Creek. But its proximity to Confederate lines enabled pro-Confederate guerrillas, such as Quantrill\\'s Raiders, to attack Union strongholds and massacre the residents.[144]\\nIn Texas, citizens voted to join the Confederacy; anti-war Germans were hanged.[145] Local troops took over the federal arsenal in San Antonio, with plans to grab the territories of northern New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado, and possibly California. Confederate Arizona was created by Arizona citizens who wanted protection against Apache raids after the United States Army units were moved out. The Confederacy then sets its sight to gain control of the New Mexico Territory. General Henry Hopkins Sibley was tasked for the campaign, and together with his New Mexico Army, marched right up the Rio Grande in an attempt to take the mineral wealth of Colorado as well as California. The First Regiment of Volunteers discovered the rebels, and they immediately warned and joined the Yankees at Fort Union. The Battle of Glorieta Pass soon erupted, and the Union ended the Confederate campaign and the area west of Texas remained in Union hands.[146][147]\\nMissouri, a Border South state where slavery was legal, became a battleground when the pro-secession governor, against the vote of the legislature, led troops to the federal arsenal at St. Louis; he was aided by Confederate forces from Arkansas and Louisiana. The Governor of Missouri and part of the state legislature signed an Ordinance of Secession at Neosho, forming the Confederate government of Missouri, and the Confederacy controlling Southern Missouri. However, Union General Samuel Curtis regained St. Louis and all of Missouri for the Union. The state was the scene of numerous raids and guerrilla warfare in the west.[148]\\nThe U.S. Army after 1850 established a series of military posts across the frontier, designed to stop warfare among Native tribes or between Natives and settlers. Throughout the 19th century, Army officers typically built their careers in peacekeeper roles moving from fort to fort until retirement. Actual combat experience was uncommon for any one soldier.[149]\\nThe most dramatic conflict was the Sioux war in Minnesota in 1862 when Dakota tribes systematically attacked German farms to drive out the settlers. For several days, Dakota attacks at the Lower Sioux Agency, New Ulm, and Hutchinson killed 300 to 400 white settlers. The state militia fought back and Lincoln sent in federal troops. The ensuing battles at Fort Ridgely, Birch Coulee, Fort Abercrombie, and Wood Lake punctuated a six-week war, which ended in an American victory. The federal government tried 425 Natives for murder, and 303 were convicted and sentenced to death. Lincoln pardoned the majority, but 38 leaders were hanged.[150]\\nThe decreased presence of Union troops in the West left behind untrained militias; hostile tribes used the opportunity to attack settlers. The militia struck back hard, most notably by attacking the winter quarters of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, filled with women and children, at the Sand Creek massacre in eastern Colorado in late 1864.[151]\\nKit Carson and the U.S. Army in 1864 trapped the entire Navajo tribe in New Mexico, where they had been raiding settlers and put them on a reservation.[152] Within the Indian Territory, now Oklahoma, conflicts arose among the Five Civilized Tribes, most of which sided with the South being slaveholders themselves.[153]\\nIn 1862, Congress enacted two major laws to facilitate settlement of the West: the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railroad Act. The result by 1890 was millions of new farms in the Plains states, many operated by new immigrants from Germany and Scandinavia.\\nWith the war over and slavery abolished, the federal government focused on improving the governance of the territories. It subdivided several territories, preparing them for statehood, following the precedents set by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. It standardized procedures and the supervision of territorial governments, taking away some local powers, and imposing much \"red tape\", growing the federal bureaucracy significantly.[154]\\nFederal involvement in the territories was considerable. In addition to direct subsidies, the federal government maintained military posts, provided safety from Native attacks, bankrolled treaty obligations, conducted surveys and land sales, built roads, staffed land offices, made harbor improvements, and subsidized overland mail delivery. Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption, and at the same time, lament that more federal dollars were not sent their way.[155]\\nTerritorial governors were political appointees and beholden to Washington so they usually governed with a light hand, allowing the legislatures to deal with the local issues. In addition to his role as civil governor, a territorial governor was also a militia commander, a local superintendent of Native affairs, and the state liaison with federal agencies. The legislatures, on the other hand, spoke for the local citizens and they were given considerable leeway by the federal government to make local law.[156]\\nThese improvements to governance still left plenty of room for profiteering. As Mark Twain wrote while working for his brother, the secretary of Nevada, \"The government of my country snubs honest simplicity but fondles artistic villainy, and I think I might have developed into a very capable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two.\"[157] \"Territorial rings\", corrupt associations of local politicians and business owners buttressed with federal patronage, embezzled from Native tribes and local citizens, especially in the Dakota and New Mexico territories.[158]\\nIn acquiring, preparing, and distributing public land to private ownership, the federal government generally followed the system set forth by the Land Ordinance of 1785. Federal exploration and scientific teams would undertake reconnaissance of the land and determine Native American habitation. Through treaties, the land titles would be ceded by the resident tribes. Then surveyors would create detailed maps marking the land into squares of six miles (10\\xa0km) on each side, subdivided first into one square mile blocks, then into 160-acre (0.65\\xa0km2) lots. Townships would be formed from the lots and sold at public auction. Unsold land could be purchased from the land office at a minimum price of $1.25 per acre.[159]\\nAs part of public policy, the government would award public land to certain groups such as veterans, through the use of \"land script\". The script traded in a financial market, often at below the $1.25 per acre minimum price set by law, which gave speculators, investors, and developers another way to acquire large tracts of land cheaply.[160] Land policy became politicized by competing factions and interests, and the question of slavery on new lands was contentious. As a counter to land speculators, farmers formed \"claims clubs\" to enable them to buy larger tracts than the 160-acre (0.65\\xa0km2) allotments by trading among themselves at controlled prices.[161]\\nIn 1862, Congress passed three important bills that transformed the land system. The Homestead Act granted 160 acres (0.65\\xa0km2) free to each settler who improved the land for five years; citizens and non-citizens including squatters and women were all eligible. The only cost was a modest filing fee. The law was especially important in the settling of the Plains states. Many took a free homestead and others purchased their land from railroads at low rates.[162][163]\\nThe Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 provided for the land needed to build the transcontinental railroad. The land was given the railroads alternated with government-owned tracts saved for free distribution to homesteaders. To be equitable, the federal government reduced each tract to 80 acres (32\\xa0ha) because of its perceived higher value given its proximity to the rail line. Railroads had up to five years to sell or mortgage their land, after tracks were laid, after which unsold land could be purchased by anyone. Often railroads sold some of their government acquired land to homesteaders immediately to encourage settlement and the growth of markets the railroads would then be able to serve. Nebraska railroads in the 1870s were strong boosters of lands along their routes. They sent agents to Germany and Scandinavia with package deals that included cheap transportation for the family as well as its furniture and farm tools, and they offered long-term credit at low rates. Boosterism succeeded in attracting adventurous American and European families to Nebraska, helping them purchase land grant parcels on good terms. The selling price depended on such factors as soil quality, water, and distance from the railroad.[164]\\nThe Morrill Act of 1862 provided land grants to states to begin colleges of agriculture and mechanical arts (engineering). Black colleges became eligible for these land grants in 1890. The Act succeeded in its goals to open new universities and make farming more scientific and profitable.[165]\\nIn the 1850s, the U.S. government sponsored surveys that charted the remaining unexplored regions of the West in order to plan possible routes for a transcontinental railroad. Much of this work was undertaken by the Corps of Engineers, Corps of Topographical Engineers, and Bureau of Explorations and Surveys, and became known as \"The Great Reconnaissance\". Regionalism animated debates in Congress regarding the choice of a northern, central, or southern route. Engineering requirements for the rail route were an adequate supply of water and wood, and as nearly-level route as possible, given the weak locomotives of the era.[166]\\nProposals to build a transcontinental failed because of Congressional disputes over slavery. With the secession of the Confederate states in 1861, the modernizers in the Republican party took over Congress and wanted a line to link to California. Private companies were to build and operate the line. Construction would be done by unskilled laborers who would live in temporary camps along the way. Immigrants from China and Ireland did most of the construction work. Theodore Judah, the chief engineer of the Central Pacific surveyed the route from San Francisco east. Judah\\'s tireless lobbying efforts in Washington were largely responsible for the passage of the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act, which authorized construction of both the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific (which built west from Omaha).[167] In 1862 four rich San Francisco merchants (Leland Stanford, Collis Huntington, Charles Crocker, and Mark Hopkins) took charge, with Crocker in charge of construction. The line was completed in May 1869. Coast-to-coast passenger travel in 8 days now replaced wagon trains or sea voyages that took 6 to 10 months and cost much more.\\nThe road was built with mortgages from New York, Boston, and London, backed by land grants. There were no federal cash subsidies, But there was a loan to the Central Pacific that was eventually repaid at six percent interest. The federal government offered land-grants in a checkerboard pattern. The railroad sold every-other square, with the government opening its half to homesteaders. The government also loaned money—later repaid—at $16,000 per mile on level stretches, and $32,000 to $48,000 in mountainous terrain. Local and state governments also aided the financing.\\nMost of the manual laborers on the Central Pacific were new arrivals from China.[168] Kraus shows how these men lived and worked, and how they managed their money. He concludes that senior officials quickly realized the high degree of cleanliness and reliability of the Chinese.[169] The Central Pacific employed over 12,000 Chinese workers, 90% of its manual workforce. Ong explores whether or not the Chinese railroad workers were exploited by the railroad, with whites in better positions. He finds the railroad set different wage rates for whites and Chinese and used the latter in the more menial and dangerous jobs, such as the handling and the pouring of nitroglycerin.[170] However the railroad also provided camps and food the Chinese wanted and protected the Chinese workers from threats from whites.[171]\\nBuilding the railroad required six main activities: surveying the route, blasting a right of way, building tunnels and bridges, clearing and laying the roadbed, laying the ties and rails, and maintaining and supplying the crews with food and tools. The work was highly physical, using horse-drawn plows and scrapers, and manual picks, axes, sledgehammers, and handcarts. A few steam-driven machines, such as shovels, were used. The rails were iron (steel came a few years later), weighed 700\\xa0lb (320\\xa0kg) and required five men to lift. For blasting, they used black powder. The Union Pacific construction crews, mostly Irish Americans, averaged about two miles (3\\xa0km) of new track per day.[172]\\nSix transcontinental railroads were built in the Gilded Age (plus two in Canada); they opened up the West to farmers and ranchers. From north to south they were the Northern Pacific, Milwaukee Road, and Great Northern along the Canada–U.S. border; the Union Pacific/Central Pacific in the middle, and to the south the Santa Fe, and the Southern Pacific. All but the Great Northern of James J. Hill relied on land grants. The financial stories were often complex. For example, the Northern Pacific received its major land grant in 1864. Financier Jay Cooke (1821–1905) was in charge until 1873 when he went bankrupt. Federal courts, however, kept bankrupt railroads in operation. In 1881 Henry Villard (1835–1900) took over and finally completed the line to Seattle. But the line went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893 and Hill took it over. He then merged several lines with financing from J.P. Morgan, but President Theodore Roosevelt broke them up in 1904.[173]\\nIn the first year of operation, 1869–70, 150,000 passengers made the long trip. Settlers were encouraged with promotions to come West on free scouting trips to buy railroad land on easy terms spread over several years. The railroads had \"Immigration Bureaus\" which advertised package low-cost deals including passage and land on easy terms for farmers in Germany and Scandinavia. The prairies, they were promised, did not mean backbreaking toil because \"settling on the prairie which is ready for the plow is different from plunging into a region covered with timber\".[174] The settlers were customers of the railroads, shipping their crops and cattle out, and bringing in manufactured products. All manufacturers benefited from the lower costs of transportation and the much larger radius of business.[175]\\nWhite concludes with a mixed verdict. The transcontinentals did open up the West to settlement, brought in many thousands of high-tech, highly paid workers and managers, created thousands of towns and cities, oriented the nation onto an east–west axis, and proved highly valuable for the nation as a whole. On the other hand, too many were built, and they were built too far ahead of actual demand. The result was a bubble that left heavy losses to investors and led to poor management practices. By contrast, as White notes, the lines in the Midwest and East supported by a very large population base, fostered farming, industry, and mining while generating steady profits and receiving few government benefits.[176]\\nAfter the Civil War, many from the East Coast and Europe were lured west by reports from relatives and by extensive advertising campaigns promising \"the Best Prairie Lands\", \"Low Prices\", \"Large Discounts For Cash\", and \"Better Terms Than Ever!\". The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look, with special family tickets, the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads. Farming the plains was indeed more difficult than back east. Water management was more critical, lightning fires were more prevalent, the weather was more extreme, rainfall was less predictable.[177]\\nThe fearful stayed home. The actual migrants looked beyond fears of the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west was to find a better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper, and more fertile land; merchants and tradesmen sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. As settlers moved west, they had to face challenges along the way, such as the lack of wood for housing, bad weather like blizzards and droughts, and fearsome tornadoes.[178] In the treeless prairies homesteaders built sod houses. One of the greatest plagues that hit the homesteaders was the 1874 Locust Plague which devastated the Great Plains.[179] These challenges hardened these settlers in taming the frontier.[180]\\nAfter Russia\\'s defeat in the Crimean War, Tsar Alexander II of Russia decided to sell the Russian American territory of Alaska to the United States. The decision was motivated in part by a need for money and in part a recognition amongst the Russian state that Britain could easily capture Alaska in any future conflict between the two nations. U.S. Secretary of State William Seward negotiated with the Russians to acquire the tremendous landmass of Alaska, an area roughly one-fifth the size of the rest of the United States. On March 30, 1867, the U.S. purchased the territory from the Russians for $7.2\\xa0million ($157\\xa0million in 2023 dollars). The transfer ceremony was completed in Sitka on October 18, 1867, as Russian soldiers handed over the territory to the United States Army.\\nCritics at the time decried the purchase as \"Seward\\'s Folly\", reasoning that there were no natural resources in the new territory and no one can be bothered to live in such a cold, icy climate. Although the development and settlement of Alaska grew slowly, the discovery of goldfields during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1896, Nome Gold Rush in 1898, and Fairbanks Gold Rush in 1902 brought thousands of miners into the territory, thus propelling Alaska\\'s prosperity for decades to come. Major oil discoveries in the late 20th century made the state rich.[181]\\nIn 1889, Washington opened 2,000,000 acres (8,100\\xa0km2) of unoccupied lands in the Oklahoma territory. On April 22, over 100,000 settlers and cattlemen (known as \"boomers\")[182] lined up at the border, and when the army\\'s guns and bugles giving the signal, began a mad dash to stake their claims in the Land Run of 1889. A witness wrote, \"The horsemen had the best of it from the start. It was a fine race for a few minutes, but soon the riders began to spread out like a fan, and by the time they reached the horizon they were scattered about as far as the eye could see\".[183] In a single day, the towns of Oklahoma City, Norman, and Guthrie came into existence. In the same manner, millions of acres of additional land were opened up and settled in the following four years.[184]\\nIndian wars have occurred throughout the United States though the conflicts are generally separated into two categories; the Indian wars east of the Mississippi River and the Indian wars west of the Mississippi. The U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894) provided an estimate of deaths:\\nThe \"Indian\" wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the given... Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate...[185]Historian Russell Thornton estimates that from 1800 to 1890, the Native population declined from 600,000 to as few as 250,000. The depopulation was principally caused by disease as well as warfare. Many tribes in Texas, such as the Karankawan, Akokisa, Bidui and others, were extinguished due to conflicts with Texan settlers.[186] The rapid depopulation of the Native Americans after the Civil War alarmed the U.S. government, and the Doolittle Committee was formed to investigate the causes as well as provide recommendations for preserving the population.[187][188] The solutions presented by the committee, such as the establishment of the five boards of inspection to prevent Native abuses, had little effect as large Western migration commenced.[189]\\nThe expansion of migration into the Southeastern United States in the 1820s to the 1830s forced the federal government to deal with the \"Indian question\". The Natives were under federal control but were independent of state governments. State legislatures and state judges had no authority on their lands, and the states demanded control. Politically the new Democratic Party of President Andrew Jackson demanded the removal of the Natives out of the southeastern states to new lands in the west, while the Whig Party and the Protestant churches were opposed to removal. The Jacksonian Democracy proved irresistible, as it won the presidential elections of 1828, 1832, and 1836. By 1837 the \"Indian Removal policy\" began, to implement the act of Congress signed by Andrew Jackson in 1830. Many historians have sharply attacked Jackson.[190] The 1830 law theoretically provided for voluntary removal and had safeguards for the rights of Natives, but in reality, the removal was involuntary, brutal and ignored safeguards.[191] Jackson justified his actions by stating that Natives had \"neither the intelligence, the industry, the moral habits, nor the desire of improvements\".[192]\\nThe forced march of about twenty tribes included the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole). To motivate Natives reluctant to move, the federal government also promised rifles, blankets, tobacco, and cash. By 1835 the Cherokee, the last Native nation in the South, had signed the removal treaty and relocated to Oklahoma. All the tribes were given new land in the \"Indian Territory\" (which later became Oklahoma). Of the approximate 70,000 Natives removed, about 18,000 died from disease, starvation, and exposure on the route.[193] This exodus has become known as the Trail of Tears (in Cherokee \"Nunna dual Tsuny\", \"The Trail Where they Cried\"). The impact of the removals was severe. The transplanted tribes had considerable difficulty adapting to their new surroundings and sometimes clashed with the tribes native to the area.[194]\\nThe only way for a Native to remain and avoid removal was to accept the federal offer of 640 acres (2.6\\xa0km2) or more of land (depending on family size) in exchange for leaving the tribe and becoming a state citizen subject to state law and federal law. However, many Natives who took the offer were defrauded by \"ravenous speculators\" who stole their claims and sold their land to whites. In Mississippi alone, fraudulent claims reached 3,800,000 acres (15,000\\xa0km2). Of the five tribes, the Seminole offered the most resistance, hiding out in the Florida swamps and waging a war which cost the U.S. Army 1,500 lives and $20\\xa0million.[195]\\nNative warriors in the West, using their traditional style of limited, battle-oriented warfare, confronted the U.S. Army. The Natives emphasized bravery in combat while the Army put its emphasis not so much on individual combat as on building networks of forts, developing a logistics system, and using the telegraph and railroads to coordinate and concentrate its forces. Plains Indian intertribal warfare bore no resemblance to the \"modern\" warfare practiced by the Americans along European lines, using its vast advantages in population and resources. Many tribes avoided warfare and others supported the U.S. Army. The tribes hostile to the government continued to pursue their traditional brand of fighting and, therefore, were unable to have any permanent success against the Army.[196]\\nIndian wars were fought throughout the western regions, with more conflicts in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states. Arizona ranked highest, with 310 known battles fought within the state\\'s boundaries between Americans and the Natives. Arizona ranked highest in war deaths, with 4,340 killed, including soldiers, civilians, and Native Americans. That was more than twice as many as occurred in Texas, the second-highest-ranking state. Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the Apache. Michno also says that fifty-one percent of the Indian war battles between 1850 and 1890 took place in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, as well as thirty-seven percent of the casualties in the county west of the Mississippi River.[197] The Comanche fought a number of conflicts against Spanish and later Mexican and American armies. Comanche power peaked in the 1840s when they conducted large-scale raids hundreds of miles into Mexico proper, while also warring against the Anglo-Americans and Tejanos who had settled in independent Texas.[198]\\nOne of the deadliest Indian wars fought was the Snake War in 1864–1868, which was conducted by a confederacy of Northern Paiute, Bannock and Shoshone Native Americans, called the \"Snake Indians\" against the United States Army in the states of Oregon, Nevada, California, and Idaho which ran along the Snake River.[199] The war started when tension arose between the local Natives and the flooding pioneer trains encroaching through their lands, which resulted in competition for food and resources. Natives included in this group attacked and harassed emigrant parties and miners crossing the Snake River Valley, which resulted in further retaliation of the white settlements and the intervention of the United States army. The war resulted in a total of 1,762 men who have been killed, wounded, and captured from both sides. Unlike other Indian Wars, the Snake War has widely forgotten in United States history due to having only limited coverage of the war.[200]\\nThe Colorado War fought by Cheyenne, Arapaho and Sioux, was fought in the territories of Colorado to Nebraska. The conflict was fought in 1863–1865 while the American Civil War was still ongoing. Caused by dissolution between the Natives and the white settlers in the region, the war was infamous for the atrocities done between the two parties. White militias destroyed Native villages and killed Native women and children such as the bloody Sand Creek massacre, and the Natives also raided ranches, farms and killed white families such as the American Ranch massacre and Raid on Godfrey Ranch.[201][202]\\nIn the Apache Wars, Colonel Christopher \"Kit\" Carson forced the Mescalero Apache onto a reservation in 1862. In 1863–1864, Carson used a scorched earth policy in the Navajo Campaign, burning Navajo fields and homes, and capturing or killing their livestock. He was aided by other Native tribes with long-standing enmity toward the Navajos, chiefly the Utes.[203] Another prominent conflict of this war was Geronimo\\'s fight against settlements in Texas in the 1880s. The Apaches under his command conducted ambushes on US cavalries and forts, such as their attack on Cibecue Creek, while also raiding upon prominent farms and ranches, such as their infamous attack on the Empire Ranch that killed three cowboys.[204][205] The U.S. finally induced the last hostile Apache band under Geronimo to surrender in 1886.\\nDuring the Comanche Campaign, the Red River War was fought in 1874–1875 in response to the Comanche\\'s dwindling food supply of buffalo, as well as the refusal of a few bands to be inducted in reservations.[206] Comanches started raiding small settlements in Texas, which led to the Battle of Buffalo Wallow and Second Battle of Adobe Walls fought by buffalo hunters, and the Battle of Lost Valley against the Texas Rangers. The war finally ended with a final confrontation between the Comanches and the U.S. Cavalry in Palo Duro Canyon. The last Comanche war chief, Quanah Parker, surrendered in June 1875, which would finally end the wars fought by Texans and Natives.[207]\\nRed Cloud\\'s War was led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud against the military who were erecting forts along the Bozeman Trail. It was the most successful campaign against the U.S. during the Indian Wars. By the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), the U.S. granted a large reservation to the Lakota, without military presence; it included the entire Black Hills.[208] Captain Jack was a chief of the Native American Modoc tribe of California and Oregon, and was their leader during the Modoc War. With 53 Modoc warriors, Captain Jack held off 1,000 men of the U.S. Army for seven months. Captain Jack killed Edward Canby.[209]\\nIn June 1877, in the Nez Perce War the Nez Perce under Chief Joseph, unwilling to give up their traditional lands and move to a reservation, undertook a 1,200-mile (2,000\\xa0km) fighting retreat from Oregon to near the Canada–U.S. border in Montana. Numbering only 200 warriors, the Nez Perce \"battled some 2,000 American regulars and volunteers of different military units, together with their Native auxiliaries of many tribes, in a total of eighteen engagements, including four major battles and at least four fiercely contested skirmishes.\"[210] The Nez Perce were finally surrounded at the Battle of Bear Paw and surrendered. The Great Sioux War of 1876 was conducted by the Lakota under Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. The conflict began after repeated violations of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) once gold was discovered in the hills. One of its famous battles was the Battle of the Little Bighorn, in which combined Sioux and Cheyenne forces defeated the 7th Cavalry, led by General George Armstrong Custer.[211] The Ute War, fought by the Ute people against settlers in Utah and Colorado, led to two battles; the Meeker massacre which killed 11 Native agents, and the Pinhook massacre which killed 13 armed ranchers and cowboys.[212][213] The Ute conflicts finally ended after the events of the Posey War in 1923 which was fought against settlers and law enforcement.[214]\\nThe end of the major Indian wars came at the Wounded Knee massacre on December 29, 1890, where the 7th Cavalry attempted to disarm a Sioux man and precipitated a massacre in which about 150 Sioux men, women, and children were killed. Only thirteen days before, Sitting Bull had been killed with his son Crow Foot in a gun battle with a group of Native police that had been sent by the American government to arrest him.[215] Additional conflicts and incidents though, such as the Bluff War (1914–1915) and Posey War, would occur into the early 1920s.[214] The last combat engagement between U.S. Army soldiers and Native Americans though occurred in the Battle of Bear Valley on January 9, 1918.[216]\\nAs the frontier moved westward, the establishment of U.S. military forts moved with it, representing and maintaining federal sovereignty over new territories.[217][218] The military garrisons usually lacked defensible walls but were seldom attacked. They served as bases for troops at or near strategic areas, particularly for counteracting the Native presence. For example, Fort Bowie protected Apache Pass in southern Arizona along the mail route between Tucson and El Paso and was used to launch attacks against Cochise and Geronimo. Fort Laramie and Fort Kearny helped protect immigrants crossing the Great Plains and a series of posts in California protected miners. Forts were constructed to launch attacks against the Sioux. As Indian reservations sprang up, the military set up forts to protect them. Forts also guarded the Union Pacific and other rail lines. Other important forts were Fort Sill, Oklahoma, Fort Smith, Arkansas, Fort Snelling, Minnesota, Fort Union, New Mexico, Fort Worth, Texas, and Fort Walla Walla in Washington. Fort Omaha, Nebraska, was home to the Department of the Platte, and was responsible for outfitting most Western posts for more than 20 years after its founding in the late 1870s. Fort Huachuca in Arizona was also originally a frontier post and is still in use by the United States Army.\\nSettlers on their way overland to Oregon and California became targets of Native threats. Robert L. Munkres read 66 diaries of parties traveling the Oregon Trail between 1834 and 1860 to estimate the actual dangers they faced from Native attacks in Nebraska and Wyoming. The vast majority of diarists reported no armed attacks at all. However many did report harassment by Natives who begged or demanded tolls, and stole horses and cattle.[219] Madsen reports that the Shoshoni and Bannock tribes north and west of Utah were more aggressive toward wagon trains.[220] The federal government attempted to reduce tensions and create new tribal boundaries in the Great Plains with two new treaties in early 1850, The Treaty of Fort Laramie established tribal zones for the Sioux, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Crows, and others, and allowed for the building of roads and posts across the tribal lands. A second treaty secured safe passage along the Santa Fe Trail for wagon trains. In return, the tribes would receive, for ten years, annual compensation for damages caused by migrants.[221] The Kansas and Nebraska territories also became contentious areas as the federal government sought those lands for the future transcontinental railroad. In the Far West settlers began to occupy land in Oregon and California before the federal government secured title from the native tribes, causing considerable friction. In Utah, the Mormons also moved in before federal ownership was obtained.\\nA new policy of establishing reservations came gradually into shape after the boundaries of the \"Indian Territory\" began to be ignored. In providing for Indian reservations, Congress and the Office of Indian Affairs hoped to de-tribalize Native Americans and prepare them for integration with the rest of American society, the \"ultimate incorporation into the great body of our citizen population\".[222] This allowed for the development of dozens of riverfront towns along the Missouri River in the new Nebraska Territory, which was carved from the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase after the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Influential pioneer towns included Omaha, Nebraska City, and St. Joseph.\\nAmerican attitudes towards Natives during this period ranged from malevolence (\"the only good Indian is a dead Indian\") to misdirected humanitarianism (Indians live in \"inferior\" societies and by assimilation into white society they can be redeemed) to somewhat realistic (Native Americans and settlers could co-exist in separate but equal societies, dividing up the remaining western land).[223] Dealing with nomadic tribes complicated the reservation strategy and decentralized tribal power made treaty making difficult among the Plains Indians. Conflicts erupted in the 1850s, resulting in various Indian wars.[224] In these times of conflict, Natives become more stringent about white men entering their territory. Such as in the case of Oliver Loving, they would sometimes attack cowboys and their cattle if ever caught crossing in the borders of their land.[225][226] They would also prey upon livestock if the food was scarce during hard times. However, the relationship between cowboys and Native Americans were more mutual than they are portrayed, and the former would occasionally pay a fine of 10 cents per cow for the latter to allow them to travel through their land.[227] Natives also preyed upon stagecoaches travelling in the frontier for its horses and valuables.[228]\\nAfter the Civil War, as the volunteer armies disbanded, the regular army cavalry regiments increased in number from six to ten, among them Custer\\'s U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment of Little Bighorn fame, and the African-American U.S. 9th Cavalry Regiment and U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment. The black units, along with others (both cavalry and infantry), collectively became known as the Buffalo Soldiers. According to Robert M. Utley:\\nThe frontier army was a conventional military force trying to control, by conventional military methods, a people that did not behave like conventional enemies and, indeed, quite often were not enemies at all. This is the most difficult of all military assignments, whether in Africa, Asia, or the American West.[229]Westerners were proud of their leadership in the movement for democracy and equality, a major theme for Frederick Jackson Turner. The new states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Ohio were more democratic than the parent states back East in terms of politics and society.[230] The Western states were the first to give women the right to vote. By 1900 the West, especially California and Oregon, led the Progressive movement.\\nScholars have examined the social history of the west in search of the American character. The history of Kansas, argued historian Carl L. Becker a century ago, reflects American ideals. He wrote: \"The Kansas spirit is the American spirit double distilled. It is a new grafted product of American individualism, American idealism, American intolerance. Kansas is America in microcosm.\"[231]\\nScholars have compared the emergence of democracy in America with other countries, regarding the frontier experience.[232] Selwyn Troen has made the comparison with Israel. The American frontiersmen relied on individual effort, in the context of very large quantities of unsettled land with weak external enemies. Israel by contrast, operated in a very small geographical zone, surrounded by more powerful neighbors. The Jewish pioneer was not building an individual or family enterprise, but was a conscious participant in nation-building, with a high priority on collective and cooperative planned settlements. The Israeli pioneers brought in American experts on irrigation and agriculture to provide technical advice. However, they rejected the American frontier model in favor of a European model that supported their political and security concerns.[233]\\nThe cities played an essential role in the development of the frontier, as transportation hubs, financial and communications centers, and providers of merchandise, services, and entertainment.[234] As the railroads pushed westward into the unsettled territory after 1860, they build service towns to handle the needs of railroad construction crews, train crews, and passengers who ate meals at scheduled stops.[235] In most of the South, there were very few cities of any size for miles around, and this pattern held for Texas as well, so railroads did not arrive until the 1880s. They then shipped the cattle out and cattle drives became short-distance affairs. However, the passenger trains were often the targets of armed gangs.[236]\\nDenver\\'s economy before 1870 had been rooted in mining; it then grew by expanding its role in railroads, wholesale trade, manufacturing, food processing, and servicing the growing agricultural and ranching hinterland. Between 1870 and 1890, manufacturing output soared from $600,000 to $40\\xa0million, and the population grew by a factor of 20 times to 107,000. Denver had always attracted miners, workers, whores, and travelers. Saloons and gambling dens sprung up overnight. The city fathers boasted of its fine theaters, and especially the Tabor Grand Opera House built in 1881.[237] By 1890, Denver had grown to be the 26th largest city in America, and the fifth-largest city west of the Mississippi River.[238] The boom times attracted millionaires and their mansions, as well as hustlers, poverty, and crime. Denver gained regional notoriety with its range of bawdy houses, from the sumptuous quarters of renowned madams to the squalid \"cribs\" located a few blocks away. Business was good; visitors spent lavishly, then left town. As long as madams conducted their business discreetly, and \"crib girls\" did not advertise their availability too crudely, authorities took their bribes and looked the other way. Occasional cleanups and crack downs satisfied the demands for reform.[239]\\nWith its giant mountain of copper, Butte, Montana, was the largest, richest, and rowdiest mining camp on the frontier. It was an ethnic stronghold, with the Irish Catholics in control of politics and of the best jobs at the leading mining corporation Anaconda Copper.[240] City boosters opened a public library in 1894. Ring argues that the library was originally a mechanism of social control, \"an antidote to the miners\\' proclivity for drinking, whoring, and gambling\". It was also designed to promote middle-class values and to convince Easterners that Butte was a cultivated city.[241]\\nEuropean immigrants often built communities of similar religious and ethnic backgrounds. For example, many Finns went to Minnesota and Michigan, Swedes and Norwegians to Minnesota and the Dakotas, Irish to railroad centers along the transcontinental lines, Volga Germans to North Dakota, English converts to the LDS church went to Utah including English immigrants who settled in the Rocky Mountain states (Colorado,Wyoming and Idaho) and German Jews to Portland, Oregon.[242][243]\\nAfrican Americans moved West as soldiers, as well as cowboys (see Black cowboy), farmhands, saloon workers, cooks, and outlaws. The Buffalo Soldiers were soldiers in the all-black 9th and 10th Cavalry regiments, and 24th and 25th Infantry Regiments of the U.S. Army. They had white officers and served in numerous western forts.[244]\\nAbout 4,000 black people came to California in Gold Rush days. In 1879, after the end of Reconstruction in the South, several thousand Freedmen moved from Southern states to Kansas. Known as the Exodusters, they were lured by the prospect of good, cheap Homestead Law land and better treatment. The all-black town of Nicodemus, Kansas, which was founded in 1877, was an organized settlement that predates the Exodusters but is often associated with them.[245]\\nThe California Gold Rush included thousands of Mexican and Chinese arrivals. Chinese migrants, many of whom were impoverished peasants, provided the major part of the workforce for the building of the Central Pacific portion of the transcontinental railroad. Most of them went home by 1870 when the railroad was finished.[246] Those who stayed on worked in mining, agriculture, and opened small shops such as groceries, laundries, and restaurants. Hostility against the Chinese remained high in the western states/territories as seen by the Chinese Massacre Cove episode and the Rock Springs massacre. The Chinese were generally forced into self-sufficient \"Chinatowns\" in cities such as San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Los Angeles.[247] In Los Angeles, the last major anti-Chinese riot took place in 1871, after which local law enforcement grew stronger.[248] In the late 19th century, Chinatowns were squalid slums known for their vice, prostitution, drugs, and violent battles between \"tongs\". By the 1930s, however, Chinatowns had become clean, safe and attractive tourist destinations.[249]\\nThe first Japanese arrived in the U.S. in 1869, with the arrival of 22 people from samurai families, settling in Placer County, California, to establish the Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony. Japanese were recruited to work on plantations in Hawaii, beginning in 1885. By the late 19th century, more Japanese emigrated to Hawaii and the American mainland. The Issei, or first-generation Japanese immigrants, were not allowed to become U.S. citizens because they were not \"free white person[s]\", per the United States Naturalization Law of 1790. This did not change until the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, known as the McCarran-Walter Act, which allowed Japanese immigrants to become naturalized U.S. citizens.\\nBy 1920, Japanese-American farmers produced US$67\\xa0million worth of crops, more than ten percent of California\\'s total crop value. There were 111,000 Japanese Americans in the U.S., of which 82,000 were immigrants and 29,000 were U.S. born.[250] Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924 effectively ending all Japanese immigration to the U.S. The U.S.-born children of the Issei were citizens, in accordance to the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution.[251]\\nThe great majority of Hispanics who had been living in the former territories of New Spain remained and became American citizens in 1848.[252] The 10,000 or so Californios also became U.S. citizens. They lived in southern California and after 1880 were overshadowed by the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals from the eastern states. Those in New Mexico dominated towns and villages that changed little until well into the 20th century. New arrivals from Mexico arrived, especially after the Revolution of 1911 terrorized thousands of villages all across Mexico. Most refugees went to Texas or California, and soon poor barrios appeared in many border towns. The California \"Robin Hood\", Joaquin Murrieta, led a gang in the 1850s which burned houses, killed exploiting miners, robbed stagecoaches of landowners and fought against violence and discrimination against Latin Americans. In Texas, Juan Cortina led a 20-year campaign against Anglos and the Texas Rangers, starting around 1859.[253]\\nOn the Great Plains very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch; farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding, and clothing the family, managing the housework, and feeding the hired hands.[254] During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in the schools all contributed to this trend.[255]\\nAlthough the eastern image of farm life on the prairies emphasizes the isolation of the lonely farmer and farm life, in reality, rural folk created a rich social life for themselves. They often sponsored activities that combined work, food, and entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, quilting bees,[256] Grange meetings,[257] church activities, and school functions. The womenfolk organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families.[258]\\nChildhood on the American frontier is contested territory. One group of scholars, following the lead of novelists Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder, argue the rural environment was beneficial to the child\\'s upbringing. Historians Katherine Harris[259] and Elliott West[260] write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and at the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten[261] and Lillian Schlissel[262] offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age. Riney-Kehrberg takes a middle position.[263]\\nEntrepreneurs set up shops and businesses to cater to the miners. World-famous were the houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide.[264] Prostitution was a growth industry attracting sex workers from around the globe, pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes; they had to send their earnings back to the family in China.[265] In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, Julia Bulette, was one of the few who achieved \"respectable\" status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic; this gave her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867; they gave her a lavish funeral and speedily tried and hanged her assailant.[266] Until the 1890s, madams predominantly ran the businesses, after which male pimps took over, and the treatment of the women generally declined. It was not uncommon for bordellos in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma of East Coast cities. Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later—as the female population increased, reformers moved in, and other civilizing influences arrived—did prostitution become less blatant and less common.[267] After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses, organized church societies, worked as laundresses and seamstresses and strove for independent status.[268]\\nWhenever a new settlement or mining camp started one of the first buildings or tents erected would be a gambling hall. As the population grew, gambling halls were typically the largest and most ornately decorated buildings in any town and often housed a bar, stage for entertainment, and hotel rooms for guests. These establishments were a driving force behind the local economy and many towns measured their prosperity by the number of gambling halls and professional gamblers they had. Towns that were friendly to gambling were typically known to sports as \"wide-awake\" or \"wide-open\".[269] Cattle towns in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska became famous centers of gambling. The cowboys had been accumulating their wages and postponing their pleasures until they finally arrived in town with money to wager. Abilene, Dodge City, Wichita, Omaha, and Kansas City all had an atmosphere that was convivial to gaming. Such an atmosphere also invited trouble and such towns also developed reputations as lawless and dangerous places.[270][271]\\nHistorian Waddy W. Moore uses court records to show that on the sparsely settled Arkansas frontier lawlessness was common. He distinguished two types of crimes: unprofessional (dueling, crimes of drunkenness, selling whiskey to the Natives, cutting trees on federal land) and professional (rustling, highway robbery, counterfeiting).[273] Criminals found many opportunities to rob pioneer families of their possessions, while the few underfunded lawmen had great difficulty detecting, arresting, holding, and convicting wrongdoers. Bandits, typically in groups of two or three, rarely attacked stagecoaches with a guard carrying a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun; it proved less risky to rob teamsters, people on foot, and solitary horsemen,[274] while bank robberies themselves were harder to pull off due to the security of the establishment. According to historian Brian Robb, the earliest form of organized crime in America was born from the gangs of the Old West.[275]\\nWhen criminals were convicted, the punishment was severe.[273] Aside from the occasional Western sheriff and Marshal, there were other various law enforcement agencies throughout the American frontier, such as the Texas Rangers.[276] These lawmen were not just instrumental in keeping the peace, but also in protecting the locals from Native and Mexican threats at the border.[277] Law enforcement tended to be more stringent in towns than in rural areas. Law enforcement emphasized maintaining stability more than armed combat, focusing on drunkenness, disarming cowboys who violated gun-control edicts and dealing with flagrant breaches of gambling and prostitution ordinances.[278]\\nDykstra argues that the violent image of the cattle towns in film and fiction is largely a myth. The real Dodge City, he says, was the headquarters for the buffalo-hide trade of the Southern Plains and one of the West\\'s principal cattle towns, a sale and shipping point for cattle arriving from Texas. He states there is a \"second Dodge City\" that belongs to the popular imagination and thrives as a cultural metaphor for violence, chaos, and depravity.[279] For the cowboy arriving with money in hand after two months on the trail, the town was exciting. A contemporary eyewitness of Hays City, Kansas, paints a vivid image of this cattle town:\\nHays City by lamplight was remarkably lively, but not very moral. The streets blazed with a reflection from saloons, and a glance within showed floors crowded with dancers, the gaily dressed women striving to hide with ribbons and paint the terrible lines which that grim artist, Dissipation, loves to draw upon such faces... To the music of violins and the stamping of feet the dance went on, and we saw in the giddy maze old men who must have been pirouetting on the very edge of their graves.[280]It has been acknowledged that the popular portrayal of Dodge City in film and fiction carries a note of truth, however, as gun crime was rampant in the city before the establishment of a local government. Soon after the city\\'s residents officially established their first municipal government, however, a law banning concealed firearms was enacted and crime was reduced soon afterward. Similar laws were passed in other frontier towns to reduce the rate of gun crime as well. As UCLA law professor Adam Wrinkler noted:\\nCarrying of guns within the city limits of a frontier town was generally prohibited. Laws barring people from carrying weapons were commonplace, from Dodge City to Tombstone. When Dodge City residents first formed their municipal government, one of the very first laws enacted was a ban on concealed carry. The ban was soon after expanded to open carry, too. The Hollywood image of the gunslinger marching through town with two Colts on his hips is just that—a Hollywood image, created for its dramatic effect.[281]Tombstone, Arizona, was a turbulent mining town that flourished longer than most, from 1877 to 1929.[282] Silver was discovered in 1877, and by 1881 the town had a population of over 10,000. In 1879 the newly arrived Earp brothers bought shares in the Vizina mine, water rights, and gambling concessions, but Virgil, Wyatt, and Morgan Earp obtained positions at different times as federal and local lawmen. After more than a year of threats and feuding, they, along with Doc Holliday, killed three outlaws in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, the most famous gunfight of the Old West. In the aftermath, Virgil Earp was maimed in an ambush, and Morgan Earp was assassinated while playing billiards. Wyatt and others, including his brothers James Earp and Warren Earp, pursued those they believed responsible in an extra-legal vendetta and warrants were issued for their arrest in the murder of Frank Stilwell. The Cochise County Cowboys were one of the first organized crime syndicates in the United States, and their demise came at the hands of Wyatt Earp.[283]\\nWestern story tellers and film makers featured the gunfight in many Western productions.[284] Walter Noble Burns\\'s novel Tombstone (1927) made Earp famous. Hollywood celebrated Earp\\'s Tombstone days with John Ford\\'s My Darling Clementine (1946), John Sturges\\'s Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) and Hour of the Gun (1967), Frank Perry\\'s Doc (1971), George Cosmatos\\'s Tombstone (1993), and Lawrence Kasdan\\'s Wyatt Earp (1994). They solidified Earp\\'s modern reputation as the Old West\\'s deadliest gunman.[285]\\nThe major type of banditry was conducted by the infamous outlaws of the West, including the James–Younger Gang, Billy the Kid, the Dalton Gang, Black Bart, Sam Bass, Butch Cassidy\\'s Wild Bunch, and hundreds of others who preyed on banks, trains, stagecoaches, and in some cases even armed government transports such as the Wham Paymaster robbery and the Skeleton Canyon robbery.[287][288] Some of the outlaws, such as Jesse James, were products of the violence of the Civil War (James had ridden with Quantrill\\'s Raiders) and others became outlaws during hard times in the cattle industry. Many were misfits and drifters who roamed the West avoiding the law. In rural areas Joaquin Murieta, Jack Powers, Augustine Chacon and other bandits terrorized the state. When outlaw gangs were near, towns would occasionally raise a posse to drive them out or capture them. Seeing that the need to combat the bandits was a growing business opportunity, Allan Pinkerton ordered his National Detective Agency, founded in 1850, to open branches in the West, and they got into the business of pursuing and capturing outlaws.[289] To take refuge from the law, outlaws would use the advantages of the open range, remote passes, and badlands to hide.[290] While some settlements and towns in the frontier also house outlaws and criminals, which were called \"outlaw towns\".[291]\\nBanditry was a major issue in California after 1849, as thousands of young men detached from family or community moved into a land with few law enforcement mechanisms. To combat this, the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance was established to give drumhead trials and death sentences to well-known offenders. As such, other earlier settlements created their private agencies to protect communities due to the lack of peace-keeping establishments.[292][293] These vigilance committees reflected different occupations in the frontier, such as land clubs, cattlemen\\'s associations and mining camps. Similar vigilance committees also existed in Texas, and their main objective was to stamp out lawlessness and rid communities of desperadoes and rustlers.[294] These committees would sometimes form mob rule for private vigilante groups, but usually were made up of responsible citizens who wanted only to maintain order. Criminals caught by these vigilance committees were treated cruelly; often hung or shot without any form of trial.[295]\\nCivilians also took arms to defend themselves in the Old West, sometimes siding with lawmen (Coffeyville Bank Robbery), or siding with outlaws (Battle of Ingalls). In the Post-Civil War frontier, over 523 whites, 34 blacks, and 75 others were victims of lynching.[296] However, cases of lynching in the Old West wasn\\'t primarily caused by the absence of a legal system, but also because of social class. Historian Michael J. Pfeifer writes, \"Contrary to the popular understanding, early territorial lynching did not flow from an absence or distance of law enforcement but rather from the social instability of early communities and their contest for property, status, and the definition of social order.\"[297]\\nRange wars were infamous armed conflicts that took place in the \"open range\" of the American frontier. The subject of these conflicts was the control of lands freely used for farming and cattle grazing which gave the conflict its name.[298] Range wars became more common by the end of the American Civil War, and numerous conflicts were fought such as the Pleasant Valley War, Johnson County War, Pecos War, Mason County War, Colorado Range War, Fence Cutting War, Colfax County War, Castaic Range War, Spring Creek raid, Porum Range War, Barber–Mizell feud, San Elizario Salt War and others.[299] During a range war in Montana, a vigilante group called Stuart\\'s Stranglers, which were made up of cattlemen and cowboys, killed up to 20 criminals and range squatters in 1884 alone.[300][301] In Nebraska, stock grower Isom Olive led a range war in 1878 that killed a number of homesteaders from lynchings and shootouts before eventually leading to his own murder.[302] Another infamous type of open range conflict were the Sheep Wars, which were fought between sheep ranchers and cattle ranchers over grazing rights and mainly occurred in Texas, Arizona and the border region of Wyoming and Colorado.[303][304] In most cases, formal military involvement were used to quickly put an end to these conflicts. Other conflicts over land and territory were also fought such as the Regulator–Moderator War, Cortina Troubles, Las Cuevas War and the Bandit War.\\nFeuds involving families and bloodlines also occurred much in the frontier.[305] Since private agencies and vigilance committees were the substitute for proper courts, many families initially depended on themselves and their communities for their security and justice. These wars include the Lincoln County War, Tutt–Everett War, Flynn–Doran feud, Early–Hasley feud, Brooks-Baxter War, Sutton–Taylor feud, Horrell Brothers feud, Brooks–McFarland Feud, Reese–Townsend feud and the Earp Vendetta Ride.\\nThe end of the bison herds opened up millions of acres for cattle ranching.[306][307] Spanish cattlemen had introduced cattle ranching and longhorn cattle to the Southwest in the 17th century, and the men who worked the ranches, called \"vaqueros\", were the first \"cowboys\" in the West. After the Civil War, Texas ranchers raised large herds of longhorn cattle. The nearest railheads were 800 or more miles (1300+ km) north in Kansas (Abilene, Kansas City, Dodge City, and Wichita). So once fattened, the ranchers and their cowboys drove the herds north along the Western, Chisholm, and Shawnee trails. The cattle were shipped to Chicago, St. Louis, and points east for slaughter and consumption in the fast-growing cities. The Chisholm Trail, laid out by cattleman Joseph McCoy along an old trail marked by Jesse Chisholm, was the major artery of cattle commerce, carrying over 1.5\\xa0million head of cattle between 1867 and 1871 over the 800 miles (1,300\\xa0km) from south Texas to Abilene, Kansas. The long drives were treacherous, especially crossing water such as the Brazos and the Red River and when they had to fend off Natives and rustlers looking to make off with their cattle. A typical drive would take three to four months and contained two miles (3\\xa0km) of cattle six abreast. Despite the risks, a successful drive proved very profitable to everyone involved, as the price of one steer was $4 in Texas and $40 in the East.[308]\\nBy the 1870s and 1880s, cattle ranches expanded further north into new grazing grounds and replaced the bison herds in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Nebraska, and the Dakota territory, using the rails to ship to both coasts. Many of the largest ranches were owned by Scottish and English financiers. The single largest cattle ranch in the entire West was owned by American John W. Iliff, \"cattle king of the Plains\", operating in Colorado and Wyoming.[309] Gradually, longhorns were replaced by the British breeds of Hereford and Angus, introduced by settlers from the Northwest. Though less hardy and more disease-prone, these breeds produced better-tasting beef and matured faster.[310]\\nThe funding for the cattle industry came largely from British sources, as the European investors engaged in a speculative extravaganza—a \"bubble\". Graham concludes the mania was founded on genuine opportunity, as well as \"exaggeration, gullibility, inadequate communications, dishonesty, and incompetence\". A severe winter engulfed the plains toward the end of 1886 and well into 1887, locking the prairie grass under ice and crusted snow which starving herds could not penetrate. The British lost most of their money—as did eastern investors like Theodore Roosevelt, but their investments did create a large industry that continues to cycle through boom and bust periods.[311]\\nOn a much smaller scale, sheep grazing was locally popular; sheep were easier to feed and needed less water. However, Americans did not eat mutton. As farmers moved in open range cattle ranching came to an end and was replaced by barbed wire spreads where water, breeding, feeding, and grazing could be controlled. This led to \"fence wars\" which erupted over disputes about water rights.[312][313]\\nAnchoring the booming cattle industry of the 1860s and 1870s were the cattle towns in Kansas and Missouri. Like the mining towns in California and Nevada, cattle towns such as Abilene, Dodge City, and Ellsworth experienced a short period of boom and bust lasting about five years. The cattle towns would spring up as land speculators would rush in ahead of a proposed rail line and build a town and the supporting services attractive to the cattlemen and the cowboys. If the railroads complied, the new grazing ground and supporting town would secure the cattle trade. However, unlike the mining towns which in many cases became ghost towns and ceased to exist after the ore played out, cattle towns often evolved from cattle to farming and continued after the grazing lands were exhausted.[314]\\nThe concern with the protection of the environment became a new issue in the late 19th century, pitting different interests. On the one side were the lumber and coal companies who called for maximum exploitation of natural resources to maximize jobs, economic growth, and their own profit.[315]\\nIn the center were the conservationists, led by Theodore Roosevelt and his coalition of outdoorsmen, sportsmen, bird watchers, and scientists. They wanted to reduce waste; emphasized the value of natural beauty for tourism and ample wildlife for hunters; and argued that careful management would not only enhance these goals but also increase the long-term economic benefits to society by planned harvesting and environmental protections. Roosevelt worked his entire career to put the issue high on the national agenda. He was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He worked closely with Gifford Pinchot and used the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230\\xa0million acres (360,000\\xa0mi2 or 930,000\\xa0km2) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land, national parks, and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined.[316]\\nRoosevelt explained his position in 1910:\\nConservation means development as much as it does protection. I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the natural resources of our land but I do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us.[317]The third element, smallest at first but growing rapidly after 1870, were the environmentalists who honored nature for its own sake, and rejected the goal of maximizing human benefits. Their leader was John Muir (1838–1914), a widely read author and naturalist and pioneer advocate of preservation of wilderness for its own sake, and founder of the Sierra Club. Muir, a Scottish-American based in California, in 1889 started organizing support to preserve the sequoias in the Yosemite Valley; Congress did pass the Yosemite National Park bill (1890). In 1897 President Grover Cleveland created thirteen protected forests but lumber interests had Congress cancel the move. Muir, taking the persona of an Old Testament prophet,[318] crusaded against the lumberman, portraying it as a contest \"between landscape righteousness and the devil\".[319] A master publicist, Muir\\'s magazine articles, in Harper\\'s Weekly (June 5, 1897) and the Atlantic Monthly turned the tide of public sentiment.[320] He mobilized public opinion to support Roosevelt\\'s program of setting aside national monuments, national forest reserves, and national parks. However, Muir broke with Roosevelt and especially President William Howard Taft on the Hetch Hetchy dam, which was built in the Yosemite National Park to supply water to San Francisco. Biographer Donald Worster says, \"Saving the American soul from a total surrender to materialism was the cause for which he fought.\"[321]\\nThe rise of the cattle industry and the cowboy is directly tied to the demise of the huge herds of bison—usually called the \"buffalo\". Once numbering over 25\\xa0million on the Great Plains, the grass-eating herds were a vital resource animal for the Plains Indians, providing food, hides for clothing and shelter, and bones for implements. Loss of habitat, disease, and over-hunting steadily reduced the herds through the 19th century to the point of near extinction. The last 10–15\\xa0million died out in a decade 1872–1883; only 100 survived.[322] The tribes that depended on the buffalo had little choice but to accept the government offer of reservations, where the government would feed and supply them. Conservationists founded the American Bison Society in 1905; it lobbied Congress to establish public bison herds. Several national parks in the U.S. and Canada were created, in part to provide a sanctuary for bison and other large wildlife.[323] The bison population reached 500,000 by 2003.[324]\\nFollowing the 1890 U.S. census, the superintendent announced that there was no longer a clear line of advancing settlement, and hence no longer a contiguous frontier in the continental United States. When examining the later 1900 U.S. census population distribution results though, the contiguous frontier line does remain. But by the 1910 U.S. census, only pockets of the frontier remain without a clear westward line, allowing travel across the continent without ever crossing a frontier line.\\nVirgin farmland was increasingly hard to find after 1890—although the railroads advertised some in eastern Montana. Bicha shows that nearly 600,000 American farmers sought cheap land by moving to the Prairie frontier of the Canadian West from 1897 to 1914. However, about two-thirds of them grew disillusioned and returned to the U.S.[325][326] Despite this, homesteaders claimed more land in the first two decades of the 20th century than the 19th century. The Homestead Acts and proliferation of railroads are often credited as being important factors in shrinking the frontier, by efficiently bringing in settlers and required infrastructure.[327] The increased size of land grants from 160 to 320 acres in 1909 and then rangeland to 640 acres in 1916 accelerated this process.[17] Barbed wire is also reasoned to reduce the traditional open range. In addition, the growing adoption of automobiles and their required network of adequate roads, first federally subsidized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1916, solidified the frontier\\'s end.[328][329]\\nThe admission of Oklahoma as a state in 1907 upon the combination of the Oklahoma Territory and the last remaining Indian Territory, and the Arizona and New Mexico territories as states in 1912, marks the end of the frontier story for many scholars. Due to their low and uneven populations during this period though, frontier territory remained for the meantime. Of course, a few typical frontier episodes still happened such as the last stagecoach robbery occurred in Nevada\\'s remaining frontier in December 1916. A period known as \"The Western Civil War of Incorporation\" that often was violent, lasted from the 1850s to 1919.\\nThe Mexican Revolution also led to significant conflict reaching across the US-Mexico border which was still mostly within frontier territory, known as the Mexican Border War (1910–1919).[330] Flashpoints included the Battle of Columbus (1916) and the Punitive Expedition (1916–1917). The Bandit War (1915–1919) involved attacks targeted against Texan settlers.[331] Also, skirmishes involving Natives happened as late as the Bluff War (1914–1915) and the Posey War (1923).[214][216]\\nThe westward expansion of American influence and jurisdiction across the Pacific in the late 19th century was in some sense a new \"Asia–Pacific frontier\",[332] with Frederick Jackson Turner arguing this to be a necessary element of the U.S.\\'s growth, as its identity as a civilized and ideals-based nation depended on constantly overcoming a savage \\'other\\'.[333]\\nAlaska was not admitted as a state until 1959. The ethos and storyline of the \"American frontier\" had passed.[334]\\nCentral to the myth and the reality of the West is the American cowboy. In actuality, the life of a cowboy was a hard one and revolved around two annual roundups, spring and fall, the subsequent drives to market, and the time off in the cattle towns spending their hard-earned money on food, clothing, firearms, gambling, and prostitution. During winter, many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns, where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings. Working the cattle was not just a routine job but also a lifestyle that exulted in the freedom of the wide unsettled outdoors on horseback.[335] Long drives hired one cowboy for about 250 head of cattle.[336] Saloons were ubiquitous (outside Mormondom), but on the trail, the cowboys were forbidden to drink alcohol.[337] Often, hired cowboys were trained and knowledgeable in their trade such as herding, ranching and protecting cattle.[338][339] To protect their herd from wild animals, hostile Natives, and rustlers, cowboys carried with them their iconic weaponry such as the Bowie knife, lasso, bullwhip, revolvers, rifles, and shotguns.[226][338]\\nMany of the cowboys were veterans of the Civil War; a diverse group, they included Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and immigrants from many lands.[340] The earliest cowboys in Texas learned their trade, adapted their clothing, and took their jargon from the Mexican vaqueros or \"buckaroos\", the heirs of Spanish cattlemen from the middle-south of Spain. Chaps, the heavy protective leather trousers worn by cowboys, got their name from the Spanish \"chaparreras\", and the lariat, or rope, was derived from \"la reata\". All the distinct clothing of the cowboy—boots, saddles, hats, pants, chaps, slickers, bandannas, gloves, and collar-less shirts—were practical and adaptable, designed for protection and comfort. The cowboy hat quickly developed the capability, even in the early years, to identify its wearer as someone associated with the West; it came to symbolize the frontier.[341] The most enduring fashion adapted from the cowboy, popular nearly worldwide today, are \"blue jeans\", originally made by Levi Strauss for miners in 1850.[342]\\nBefore a drive, a cowboy\\'s duties included riding out on the range and bringing together the scattered cattle. The best cattle would be selected, roped, and branded, and most male cattle were castrated. The cattle also needed to be dehorned and examined and treated for infections. On the long drives, the cowboys had to keep the cattle moving and in line. The cattle had to be watched day and night as they were prone to stampedes and straying. While camping every night, cowboys would often sing to their herd to keep them calm.[343] The workdays often lasted fourteen hours, with just six hours of sleep. It was grueling, dusty work, with just a few minutes of relaxation before and at the end of a long day. On the trail, drinking, gambling, and brawling were often prohibited and fined, and sometimes cursing as well. It was monotonous and boring work, with food to match: bacon, beans, bread, coffee, dried fruit, and potatoes. On average, cowboys earned $30 to $40 per month, because of the heavy physical and emotional toll, it was unusual for a cowboy to spend more than seven years on the range.[344] As open range ranching and the long drives gave way to fenced-in ranches in the 1880s, by the 1890s the glory days of the cowboy came to an end, and the myths about the \"free-living\" cowboy began to emerge.[325][345][346]\\nIn 1849, James W. Marshall was building a sawmill for Sutter\\'s Fort on the riverside of the American River when he noticed metal flakes under the waterwheel. He recognized the flakes to be gold. However, the sawmill he was building was not his, meaning that when he finished building the sawmill, his client John Sutter would also notice. Word quickly spread of gold in the American River, leading to a surge of westward migration to California in the hope of striking it rich. This was the start of the California Gold Rush.[347] The California Gold Rush had positive and negative benefits for America. It simultaneously increased the population of California to almost 100,000 people, which helped with the modernization of California, but it also reduced the population of other states. Their employment rates took a hit as well, as people were quitting their jobs so they could embark on their journeys. The California Gold Rush finally came to an end in 1855. The extraction of gold from the river was done by dust panning; with most dust panning normally done by prospectors.[348][349]\\nEven after the California Gold Rush, mining was still a common occupation. Most mountainside towns likely had a mineshaft. Most miners were poor, as mining was a very labor-intensive job. Miners would use pickaxes in order to mine into the mountains. They mined gold, zinc, copper, and other metals. These metals were sold to shopkeepers and rich people for currency. Miners were paid a salary of $1.70 per day.[347]\\nSimilarly, other gold rushes happened in other territories as other expeditions were happening. Events such as the Black Hills Gold Rush in the Dakota Territory following the Black Hills Expedition.[350] Or the Pike\\'s Peak Gold Rush in the Nebraska Territory.[351]\\nLaws were less restrictive in the West for white women. Western states allowed women to vote long before the eastern states did and had more liberal divorce laws. Minority women did not experience the same freedoms. Native women were forced onto reservations, but still tried to maintain their ways of life and support their families. Chinese women immigrated to work in the laundries, inns, and saloons of mining camps. Some were sold to work in mining camps by their impoverished families in China. Some women were also forced to work in the sex industry.[352]\\nThe main occupation of women was running the household and raising children. Tasks included cooking, cleaning, making clothes, gardening, and helping out on the farm. Sometimes women were the sole operators of farms. Women were also entrepreneurs, running saloons, boarding houses, laundries, and inns. Independent women earned a living through teaching or sex work. In towns with male-dominated industries such as logging and mining, the gender imbalance led to different roles for women. Women were paid for domestic work that was traditionally unpaid.[353]\\nSome women also worked in predominantly male positions; there were cowgirls, female business owners, female gunslingers and female bounty hunters.[354]\\nWomen had less lawful protection compared to men.[355]\\nBeing a lumberjack was a labor-intensive occupation. The job was a fairly common occupation to have in this era, similarly to miners and railroad workers, many people pursued these careers, but was ultimately very dangerous. Loggers were paid more than both miners and railroaders combined, making $3.20 every day.[356]\\nTo cut down trees, lumberjacks had many tools to help them in the process. To cut down trees, they would send multiple loggers depending on the size of the tree. From there, they would use double-sided axes to chop the base of the tree. After the tree collapsed, if the tree was too big to chop with the double-sided axes, they would use a gigantic saw called a crosscut. These saws could be over 12 feet in length.[357]\\nAnd for transportation, they would either float the logs down a river (a profession known as log driving), or use a high-wheel loader to lift the massive logs that were strapped together using rope. Another rope was tied to oxen, then the oxen would pull the logs to wherever they needed to be.[358]\\nThe frontiersmen were the explorers of the Old West. In 1803, Thomas Jefferson closed the deal of the Louisiana Purchase for 15 million dollars. With the 828,000 square miles of gained territory. He sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark along with 45 other men to go explore the new territory. Their expedition across the Western United States turned into the famous Lewis and Clark Expedition There were many dangers on the trail; they had to travel up, portage and ford rivers, suffer injuries, disease, famine, and fending off grizzly bears and hostile Native American tribes. The Lewis and Clark expedition did take place before the Wild West era, but it was a major event in United States history, and was one of the main reasons the Wild West era began.[359]\\nBesides Lewis and Clark, the Wild West era brought many other frontiersmen. They were very self-sufficient compared to normal townspeople. They cleared their own land, built their own shelter, and farmed and foraged for their food. Their nomadic lifestyle was hurtful for America\\'s economy, as unemployment made it difficult for more money to go into circulation, and stores were going bankrupt from a lack of customers. This also caused territorial disputes with the Native Americans. For example, Charles Bent\\'s arrival into Colorado caused the Taos Revolt. Bent shortly died from an assault from multiple Pueblo warriors.[360]\\nThe names and exploits of Western gunslingers took a major role in American folklore, fiction and film. Their guns and costumes became children\\'s toys for make-believe shootouts.[361] The stories became immensely popular in Germany and other European countries, which produced their novels and films about the American frontier.[362] The image of a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth based on repeated exaggerations. Actual gunfights in the Old West were more episodic rather than being a common thing, but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied.[363] Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment, while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen. Although mostly romanticized, there were instances of \"quick draw\" that did occur though rarely, such as Wild Bill Hickok – Davis Tutt shootout and Luke Short-Jim Courtright duel.[364] Fatal duels were fought to uphold personal honor in the West.[365][366] The most notable and well-known took place in Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. To prevent gunfights, towns such as Dodge City and Tombstone prohibited firearms in town.\\nIn 1848, when the U.S. won the Mexican–American War, it gained seven new territories: California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Nevada, and Utah. This was one of the main causes of the Wild West era. When people relocated to the underdeveloped badlands, a pure culture was developed within Western America. Sonora\\'s culture was also acculturated to the Wild West.[367][368]\\nOn June 13, 1898, the Yukon Territory Act created Yukon as a separate Canadian territory. One of the most important cities on the trail, Dawson City, gave prospectors access to gold mines. causing the Klondike Gold Rush.[369] The Klondike Trail was a dangerous place; many wild animals attacked the prospectors, and contagious diseases spread throughout the trail.[370] In total, over 1,000 died on the trail from various causes.[360]\\nThe exploration, settlement, exploitation, and conflicts of the \"American Old West\" form a unique tapestry of events, which has been celebrated by Americans and foreigners alike—in art, music, dance, novels, magazines, short stories, poetry, theater, video games, movies, radio, television, song, and oral tradition—which continues in the modern era.[371] Beth E. Levy argues that the physical and mythological west inspired composers Aaron Copland, Roy Harris, Virgil Thomson, Charles Wakefield Cadman, and Arthur Farwell.[372]\\nReligious themes have inspired many environmentalists as they contemplate the pristine West before the frontiersmen violated its spirituality.[373] Actually, as a historian William Cronon has demonstrated, the concept of \"wilderness\" was highly negative and the antithesis of religiosity before the romantic movement of the 19th century.[374]\\nThe Frontier Thesis of historian Frederick Jackson Turner, proclaimed in 1893,[375] established the main lines of historiography which fashioned scholarship for three or four generations and appeared in the textbooks used by practically all American students.[376]\\nThe mythologizing of the West began with minstrel shows and popular music in the 1840s. During the same period, P. T. Barnum presented Native chiefs, dances, and other Wild West exhibits in his museums. However, large scale awareness took off when the dime novel appeared in 1859, the first being Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter.[377] By simplifying reality and grossly exaggerating the truth, the novels captured the public\\'s attention with sensational tales of violence and heroism and fixed in the public\\'s mind stereotypical images of heroes and villains—courageous cowboys and savage Natives, virtuous lawmen and ruthless outlaws, brave settlers and predatory cattlemen. Millions of copies and thousands of titles were sold. The novels relied on a series of predictable literary formulas appealing to mass tastes and were often written in as little as a few days. The most successful of all dime novels was Edward S. Ellis\\' Seth Jones (1860). Ned Buntline\\'s stories glamorized Buffalo Bill Cody, and Edward L. Wheeler created \"Deadwood Dick\" and \"Hurricane Nell\" while featuring Calamity Jane.[378]\\nBuffalo Bill Cody was the most effective popularizer of the Old West in the U.S. and Europe. He presented the first \"Wild West\" show in 1883, featuring a recreation of famous battles (especially Custer\\'s Last Stand), expert marksmanship, and dramatic demonstrations of horsemanship by cowboys and natives, as well as sure-shooting Annie Oakley.[379]\\nElite Eastern writers and artists of the late 19th century promoted and celebrated western lore.[67] Theodore Roosevelt, wearing his hats as a historian, explorer, hunter, rancher, and naturalist, was especially productive.[380] Their work appeared in upscale national magazines such as Harper\\'s Weekly featured illustrations by artists Frederic Remington, Charles M. Russell, and others. Readers bought action-filled stories by writers like Owen Wister, conveying vivid images of the Old West.[381] Remington lamented the passing of an era he helped to chronicle when he wrote:\\nI knew the wild riders and the vacant land were about to vanish forever...I saw the living, breathing end of three American centuries of smoke and dust and sweat.[382]Theodore Roosevelt wrote many books on the west and the frontier, and made frequent reference to it as president.[383]\\nFrom the late 19th century the railroads promoted tourism in the west, with guided tours of western sites, especially national parks like Yellowstone National Park.[384]\\nBoth tourists to the West, and avid fiction readers enjoyed the visual imagery of the frontier. After 1900  Western movies provided the most famous examples, as in the numerous films of John Ford. He was especially enamored of Monument Valley. Critic Keith Phipps says, \"its five square miles [13 square kilometers] have defined what decades of moviegoers think of when they imagine the American West.\"[385][386][387] The heroic stories coming out of the building of the transcontinental railroad in the mid-1860s enlivened many dime novels and illustrated many newspapers and magazines with the juxtaposition of the traditional environment with the iron horse of modernity.[388]\\nThe cowboy has for over a century been an iconic American image both in the country and abroad.[389]\\nHeather Cox Richardson argues for a political dimension to the cowboy image:[390]The timing of the cattle industry’s growth meant that cowboy imagery grew to have extraordinary power. Entangled in the vicious politics of the postwar years, Democrats, especially those in the old Confederacy, imagined the West as a land untouched by Republican politicians they hated. They developed an image of the cowboys as men who worked hard, played hard, lived by a code of honor, protected themselves, and asked nothing of the government. In the hands of Democratic newspaper editors, the realities of cowboy life—the poverty, the danger, the debilitating hours—became romantic. Cowboys embodied virtues Democrats believed Republicans were destroying by creating a behemoth government catering to lazy ex-slaves. By the 1860s, cattle drives were a feature of the plains landscape, and Democrats had made cowboys a symbol of rugged individual independence, something they insisted Republicans were destroying. The most famous popularizers of the image included part-time cowboy and \"Rough Rider\" President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), a Republican who made \"cowboy\" internationally synonymous with the brash aggressive American. He was followed by trick roper Will Rogers (1879–1935), the leading humorist of the 1920s.\\nRoosevelt had conceptualized the herder (cowboy) as a stage of civilization distinct from the sedentary farmer—a theme well expressed in the 1944 Hollywood hit Oklahoma! that highlights the enduring conflict between cowboys and farmers.[391] Roosevelt argued that the manhood typified by the cowboy—and outdoor activity and sports generally—was essential if American men were to avoid the softness and rot produced by an easy life in the city.[392]\\nWill Rogers, the son of a Cherokee judge in Oklahoma, started with rope tricks and fancy riding, but by 1919 discovered his audiences were even more enchanted with his wit in his representation of the wisdom of the common man.[393]\\nOthers who contributed to enhancing the romantic image of the American cowboy include Charles Siringo (1855–1928)[394] and Andy Adams (1859–1935). Cowboy, Pinkerton detective, and western author, Siringo was the first authentic cowboy autobiographer. Adams spent the 1880s in the cattle industry in Texas and the 1890s mining in the Rockies. When an 1898 play\\'s portrayal of Texans outraged Adams, he started writing plays, short stories, and novels drawn from his own experiences. His The Log of a Cowboy (1903) became a classic novel about the cattle business, especially the cattle drive.[395] It described a fictional drive of the Circle Dot herd from Texas to Montana in 1882 and became a leading source on cowboy life; historians retraced its path in the 1960s, confirming its basic accuracy. His writings are acclaimed and criticized for realistic fidelity to detail on the one hand and thin literary qualities on the other.[396] Many regard Red River (1948), directed by Howard Hawks, and starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift, as an authentic cattle drive depiction.[397]\\nThe unique skills of the cowboys are highlighted in the rodeo. It began in an organized fashion in the West in the 1880s, when several Western cities followed up on touring Wild West shows and organized celebrations that included rodeo activities. The establishment of major cowboy competitions in the East in the 1920s led to the growth of rodeo sports. Trail cowboys who were also known as gunfighters like John Wesley Hardin, Luke Short and others, were known for their prowess, speed and skill with their pistols and other firearms. Their violent escapades and reputations morphed over time into the stereotypical image of violence endured by the \"cowboy hero\".[361][398][399]\\nHistorians of the American West have written about the mythic West; the west of western literature, art, and of people\\'s shared memories.[400] The phenomenon is \"the Imagined West\".[401] The \"Code of the West\" was an unwritten, socially agreed upon set of informal laws shaping the cowboy culture of the Old West.[402][403][404] Over time, the cowboys developed a personal culture of their own, a blend of values that even retained vestiges of chivalry. Such hazardous work in isolated conditions also bred a tradition of self-dependence and individualism, with great value put on personal honesty, exemplified in songs and cowboy poetry.[405] The code also included the gunfighter, who sometimes followed a form of code duello adopted from the Old South, in order to solve disputes and duels.[406][407] Extrajudicial justice seen during the frontier days such as lynching, vigilantism and gunfighting, in turn popularized by the Western genre, would later be known in modern times as examples of frontier justice.[408][409]\\nScores of Frederick Jackson Turner\\'s students became professors in history departments in the western states and taught courses on the frontier influenced by his ideas.[410] Scholars have debunked many of the myths of the frontier, but they nevertheless live on in community traditions, folklore, and fiction.[411] In the 1970s a historiographical range war broke out between the traditional frontier studies, which stress the influence of the frontier on all of American history and culture, and the \"New Western History\" which narrows the geographical and temporal framework to concentrate on the trans-Mississippi West after 1850. It avoids the word \"frontier\" and stresses cultural interaction between white culture and groups such as Natives and Hispanics. History professor William Weeks of the University of San Diego argues that in this \"New Western History\" approach:\\nIt is easy to tell who the bad guys are—they are almost invariably white, male, and middle-class or better, while the good guys are almost invariably non-white, non-male, or non-middle class.... Anglo-American civilization....is represented as patriarchal, racist, genocidal, and destructive of the environment, in addition to hypocritically betraying the ideals on which it supposedly is built.[412]By 2005, Steven Aron argues that the two sides had \"reached an equilibrium in their rhetorical arguments and critiques\".[413] Since then, however, the field of American frontier and western regional history has become increasingly inclusive.[414][additional citation(s) needed] The field\\'s more recent focus was captured in the language of the 2024 Call for Papers of the Western History Association:\\nThe Western History Association was once an organization dominated by white male scholars who typically wrote triumphalist narratives. We are no longer that organization. We now produce pathbreaking scholarship by and about the members of the many communities previously excluded from traditional tales of expansion. This new work and the people writing it have transformed the WHA, the history of the U.S. West, and the profession more broadly.[414]Meanwhile, environmental history has emerged, in large part from the frontier historiography, hence its emphasis on wilderness.[415] It plays an increasingly large role in frontier studies.[416] Historians approached the environment for the frontier or regionalism. The first group emphasizes human agency on the environment; the second looks at the influence of the environment. William Cronon has argued that Turner\\'s famous 1893 essay was environmental history in an embryonic form. It emphasized the vast power of free land to attract and reshape settlers, making a transition from wilderness to civilization.[417]\\nJournalist Samuel Lubell saw similarities between the frontier\\'s Americanization of immigrants that Turner described and the social climbing by later immigrants in large cities as they moved to wealthier neighborhoods. He compared the effects of the railroad opening up Western lands to urban transportation systems and the automobile, and Western settlers\\' \"land hunger\" to poor city residents seeking social status. Just as the Republican party benefited from support from \"old\" immigrant groups that settled on frontier farms, \"new\" urban immigrants formed an important part of the Democratic New Deal coalition that began with Franklin Delano Roosevelt\\'s victory in the 1932 presidential election.[418]\\nSince the 1960s an active center is the history department at the University of New Mexico, along with the University of New Mexico Press. Leading historians there include Gerald D. Nash, Donald C. Cutter, Richard N. Ellis, Richard Etulain, Ferenc Szasz, Margaret Connell-Szasz, Paul Hutton, Virginia Scharff, and Samuel Truett. The department has collaborated with other departments and emphasizes Southwestern regionalism, minorities in the Southwest, and historiography.[419]\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nCowboy culture is the set of behaviors, preferences, and appearances associated with (or resulting from the influence of) the attitudes, ethics, and history of the American cowboy.[1] The term can describe the content or stylistic appearance of an artistic representation, often built on romanticized impressions of the wild west, or certain aspects of people's lifestyle, such as their choices in recreation (including enjoyment of Western movies and music), apparel, and western or southwestern cuisine.\\n\\nThe origins of cowboy culture go back to the Spanish vaqueros who settled in New Mexico and later Texas bringing cattle.[2] By the late 1800s, one in three cowboys were Mexican and brought to the lifestyle its iconic symbols of hats, bandanas, spurs, stirrups, lariat, and lasso.[3] With westward movement brought many distinct ethnicities all with their own cultural traditions. Welsh Americans, as one example, had a history in Wales of cattle and sheep droving, that incorporated well into ranch work.[4]In the late 19th century, folk tales about cowboys and attempts to commercialize on cowboy life by selling exaggerated ideas of it in novels and fashion became popular.[5]\\nBeginning in the 1860s, dime novels began sharing erroneous and highly romanticized tales of the West, feeding the public's interest in the trade and life West of the Mississippi.[6]\\n\\nThroughout the 20th century, radio, film and television had a profound effect on the fashion and mannerisms that built the foundation of what it meant to be living a western lifestyle, however most of this was more Hollywood glitz and glamour than historical narrative.[7] In the 1980s, following the urbanization of much of the Texas population, there was a marked revival of cowboy culture with the creation of a number of organizations devoted to its preservation, among them the American Cowboy Culture Association.[8]\\nThe following is a list of notable people who lived or are living a western lifestyle post to its technological and societal change at the beginning of the 20th century.

       "  '\\nA cowboy is an animal herder who tends cattle on ranches in North America, traditionally on horseback, and often performs a multitude of other ranch-related tasks. The historic American cowboy of the late 19th century arose from the vaquero traditions of northern Mexico and became a figure of special significance and legend.[1] A subtype, called a wrangler, specifically tends the horses used to work cattle. In addition to ranch work, some cowboys work for or participate in rodeos. Cowgirls, first defined as such in the late 19th century, had a less-well documented historical role, but in the modern world work at identical tasks and have obtained considerable respect for their achievements.[2] Cattle handlers in many other parts of the world, particularly South America and Australia, perform work similar to the cowboy.\\nThe cowboy has deep historic roots tracing back to Spain and the earliest European settlers of the Americas. Over the centuries, differences in terrain and climate, and the influence of cattle-handling traditions from multiple cultures, created several distinct styles of equipment, clothing and animal handling. As the ever-practical cowboy adapted to the modern world, his equipment and techniques also adapted, though many classic traditions are preserved.\\nThe English word cowboy has an origin from several earlier terms that referred to both age and to cattle or cattle-tending work.\\nThe English word cowboy was derived from vaquero, a Spanish word for an individual who managed cattle while mounted on horseback.  Vaquero was derived from vaca, meaning \"cow\",[3] which came from the Latin word vacca. \"Cowboy\" was first used in print by Jonathan Swift in 1725, and was used in the British Isles from 1820 to 1850 to describe young boys who tended the family or community cows.[4][5] Originally though, the English word \"cowherd\" was used to describe a cattle herder (similar to \"shepherd\", a sheep herder), and often referred to a pre-adolescent or early adolescent boy, who usually worked on foot. This word is very old in the English language, originating prior to the year 1000.[6]\\nBy 1849 \"cowboy\" had developed its modern sense as an adult cattle handler of the American West. Variations on the word appeared later. \"Cowhand\" appeared in 1852, and \"cowpoke\" in 1881, originally restricted to the individuals who prodded cattle with long poles to load them onto railroad cars for shipping.[7] Names for a cowboy in American English include buckaroo, cowpoke, cowhand, and cowpuncher.[8] Another English word for a cowboy, buckaroo, is an anglicization of vaquero (Spanish pronunciation: [baˈkeɾo]).[9]\\nToday, \"cowboy\" is a term common throughout the west and particularly in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, \"buckaroo\" is used primarily in the Great Basin and California, and \"cowpuncher\" mostly in Texas and surrounding states.[10]\\nEquestrianism required skills and an investment in horses and equipment rarely available to or entrusted to a child, though in some cultures boys rode a donkey while going to and from pasture. In antiquity, herding of sheep, cattle and goats was often the job of minors, and still is a task for young people in various Developing World cultures.\\nBecause of the time and physical ability needed to develop necessary skills, both historic and modern cowboys often began as an adolescent. Historically, cowboys earned wages as soon as they developed sufficient skill to be hired (often as young as 12 or 13). If not crippled by injury, cowboys may handle cattle or horses for a lifetime. In the United States, a few women also took on the tasks of ranching and learned the necessary skills, though the \"cowgirl\" (discussed below) did not become widely recognized or acknowledged until the close of the 19th century. On western ranches today, the working cowboy is usually an adult. Responsibility for herding cattle or other livestock is no longer considered suitable for children or early adolescents. Boys and girls growing up in a ranch environment often learn to ride horses and perform basic ranch skills as soon as they are physically able, usually under adult supervision. Such youths, by their late teens, are often given responsibilities for \"cowboy\" work on the ranch.[11]\\n\"Cowboy\" was used during the American Revolution to describe American fighters who opposed the movement for independence.  Claudius Smith, an outlaw identified with the Loyalist cause, was called the \"Cow-boy of the Ramapos\" due to his penchant for stealing oxen, cattle and horses from colonists and giving them to the British.[12] In the same period, a number of guerrilla bands operated in Westchester County, which marked the dividing line between the British and American forces. These groups were made up of local farmhands who would ambush convoys and carry out raids on both sides. There were two separate groups: the \"skinners\" fought for the pro-independence side, while the \"cowboys\" supported the British.[13][14]\\nIn the Tombstone, Arizona, area during the 1880s, the term \"cowboy\" or \"cow-boy\" was used pejoratively to describe men who had been implicated in various crimes.[15] One loosely organized band was dubbed \"The Cowboys\", and profited from smuggling cattle, alcohol, and tobacco across the U.S.–Mexico border.[16][17] The San Francisco Examiner wrote in an editorial, \"Cowboys [are] the most reckless class of outlaws in that wild country\\xa0... infinitely worse than the ordinary robber.\"[15] It became an insult in the area to call someone a \"cowboy\", as it suggested he was a horse thief, robber, or outlaw. Cattlemen were generally called herders or ranchers.[16] Other synonyms for cowboy were ranch hand, range hand or trail hand, although duties and pay were not entirely identical.[18] The Cowboys\\' activities were ultimately curtailed by the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and the resulting Earp Vendetta Ride.[15]\\nThe origins of the cowboy tradition come from Spain, beginning with the hacienda system of medieval Spain. This style of cattle ranching spread throughout much of the Iberian peninsula, and later was imported to the Americas. Both regions possessed a dry climate with sparse grass, thus large herds of cattle required vast amounts of land to obtain sufficient forage. The need to cover distances greater than a person on foot could manage gave rise to the development of the horseback-mounted vaquero.\\nVarious aspects of the Spanish equestrian tradition can be traced back to Islamic rule in Spain, including Moorish elements such as the use of Oriental-type horses, the la jineta riding style characterized by a shorter stirrup, solid-treed saddle and use of spurs,[19] the heavy noseband or hackamore,[20] (Arabic šakīma, Spanish jaquima)[21] and other horse-related equipment and techniques.[19][20] Certain aspects of the Arabic tradition, such as the hackamore, can in turn be traced to roots in ancient Persia.[20]\\nDuring the 16th century, the Conquistadors and other Spanish settlers brought their cattle-raising traditions as well as both horses and domesticated cattle to the Americas, starting with their arrival in what today is Mexico and Florida.[22] The traditions of Spain were transformed by the geographic, environmental and cultural circumstances of New Spain, which later became Mexico and the Southwestern United States. In turn, the land and people of the Americas also saw dramatic changes due to Spanish influence.\\nThe arrival of horses was particularly significant, as equines had been extinct in the Americas since the end of the prehistoric ice age. Horses quickly multiplied in America and became crucial to the success of the Spanish and later settlers from other nations. The earliest horses were originally of Andalusian, Barb and Arabian ancestry,[23] but a number of uniquely American horse breeds developed in North and South America through selective breeding and by natural selection of animals that escaped to the wild. The mustang and other colonial horse breeds are now called \"wild\", but in reality are feral horses—descendants of domesticated animals.\\nThough popularly considered American, the traditional cowboy began with the Spanish tradition, which evolved further in what today is Mexico and the Southwestern United States into the vaquero of northern Mexico and the charro of the Jalisco and Michoacán regions. While most hacendados (ranch owners) were ethnically Spanish criollos,[24] many early vaqueros were Native Americans trained to work for the Spanish missions in caring for the mission herds.[25] Vaqueros went north with livestock. In 1598, Don Juan de Oñate sent an expedition across the Rio Grande into New Mexico, bringing along 7000 head of cattle. From this beginning, vaqueros drove cattle from New Mexico and later Texas to Mexico City.[26] Mexican traditions spread both South and North, influencing equestrian traditions from Argentina to Canada.[citation needed]\\nAs English-speaking traders and settlers expanded westward, English and Spanish traditions, language and culture merged to some degree. Before the Mexican–American War in 1848, New England merchants who traveled by ship to California encountered both hacendados and vaqueros, trading manufactured goods for the hides and tallow produced from vast cattle ranches. American traders along what later became known as the Santa Fe Trail had similar contacts with vaquero life. Starting with these early encounters, the lifestyle and language of the vaquero began a transformation which merged with English cultural traditions and produced what became known in American culture as the \"cowboy\".[27]\\nThe arrival of English-speaking settlers in Texas began in 1821.[26] Rip Ford described the country between Laredo and Corpus Christi as inhabited by \"countless droves of mustangs and\\xa0... wild cattle\\xa0... abandoned by Mexicans when they were ordered to evacuate the country between the Nueces and the Rio Grande by General Valentin Canalizo\\xa0... the horses and cattle abandoned invited the raids the Texians made upon this territory.\"[28] California, on the other hand, did not see a large influx of settlers from the United States until after the Mexican–American War. In slightly different ways, both areas contributed to the evolution of the iconic American cowboy. Particularly with the arrival of railroads and an increased demand for beef in the wake of the American Civil War, older traditions combined with the need to drive cattle from the ranches where they were raised to the nearest railheads, often hundreds of miles away.[1]\\nBlack cowboys in the American West accounted for up to 25 percent of workers in the range-cattle industry from the 1860s to 1880s, estimated to be between 6,000 and 9,000 workers.[29][30] Typically former slaves or children of former slaves, many black men had skills in cattle handling and headed West at the end of the Civil War.[31]\\nBy the 1880s, the expansion of the cattle industry resulted in a need for additional open range. Thus many ranchers expanded into the northwest, where there were still large tracts of unsettled grassland. Texas cattle were herded north, into the Rocky Mountain west and the Dakotas.[32] The cowboy adapted much of his gear to the colder conditions, and westward movement of the industry also led to intermingling of regional traditions from California to Texas, often with the cowboy taking the most useful elements of each.\\nMustang-runners or Mesteñeros were cowboys and vaqueros who caught, broke and drove mustangs to market in Mexico, and later American territories of what is now Northern Mexico, Texas, New Mexico and California. They caught the mustangs that roamed the Great Plains and the San Joaquin Valley of California, and later in the Great Basin, from the 18th century to the early 20th century.[33][34]\\nLarge numbers of cattle lived in a semi-feral or a completely feral state on the open range and were left to graze, mostly untended, for much of the year. In many cases, different ranchers formed \"associations\" and grazed their cattle together on the same range. In order to determine the ownership of individual animals, they were marked with a distinctive brand, applied with a hot iron, usually while the cattle were still calves.[35]\\nIn order to find young calves for branding, and to sort out mature animals intended for sale, ranchers would hold a roundup, usually in the spring.[36] A roundup required a number of specialized skills on the part of both cowboys and horses. Individuals who separated cattle from the herd required the highest level of skill and rode specially trained \"cutting\" horses, trained to follow the movements of cattle, capable of stopping and turning faster than other horses.[37] Once cattle were sorted, most cowboys were required to rope young calves and restrain them to be branded and (in the case of most bull calves) castrated. Occasionally it was also necessary to restrain older cattle for branding or other treatment.\\nA large number of horses were needed for a roundup. Each cowboy would require three to four fresh horses in the course of a day\\'s work.[38] Horses themselves were also rounded up. It was common practice in the west for young foals to be born of tame mares, but allowed to grow up \"wild\" in a semi-feral state on the open range.[39] There were also \"wild\" herds, often known as mustangs. Both types were rounded up, and the mature animals tamed, a process called horse breaking, or \"bronco-busting\", usually performed by cowboys who specialized as horse trainers.[40] In some cases, extremely brutal methods were used to tame horses, and such animals tended to never be completely reliable. Other cowboys recognized their need to treat animals in a more humane fashion and modified their horse training methods,[41] often re-learning techniques used by the vaqueros, particularly those of the Californio tradition.[42] Horses trained in a gentler fashion were more reliable and useful for a wider variety of tasks.\\nInformal competition arose between cowboys seeking to test their cattle and horse-handling skills against one another, and thus, from the necessary tasks of the working cowboy, the sport of rodeo developed.[43]\\nPrior to the mid-19th century, most ranchers primarily raised cattle for their own needs and to sell surplus meat and hides locally. There was also a limited market for hides, horns, hooves, and tallow in assorted manufacturing processes.[44] While Texas contained vast herds of stray, free-ranging cattle available for free to anyone who could round them up,[26] prior to 1865, there was little demand for beef.[44] At the end of the American Civil War, Philip Danforth Armour opened a meat packing plant in Chicago, which became known as Armour and Company. With the expansion of the meat packing industry, the demand for beef increased significantly. By 1866, cattle could be sold to northern markets for as much as $40 per head, making it potentially profitable for cattle, particularly from Texas, to be herded long distances to market.[45]\\nThe first large-scale effort to drive cattle from Texas to the nearest railhead for shipment to Chicago occurred in 1866, when many Texas ranchers banded together to drive their cattle to the closest point that railroad tracks reached, which at that time was in Sedalia, Missouri. Farmers in eastern Kansas, afraid that Longhorns would transmit cattle fever to local animals as well as trample crops, formed groups that threatened to beat or shoot cattlemen found on their lands. Therefore, the 1866 drive failed to reach the railroad, and the cattle herds were sold for low prices.[46] In 1867, a cattle shipping facility was built west of farm country around the railhead at Abilene, Kansas, and became a center of cattle shipping, loading over 36,000 head of cattle that year.[47] The route from Texas to Abilene became known as the Chisholm Trail, after Jesse Chisholm, who marked out the route. It ran through present-day Oklahoma, which then was Indian Territory. Later, other trails forked off to different railheads, including those at Dodge City and Wichita, Kansas.[48] By 1877, the largest of the cattle-shipping boom towns, Dodge City, Kansas, shipped out 500,000 head of cattle.[49]\\nCattle drives had to strike a balance between speed and the weight of the cattle. While cattle could be driven as far as 25 miles (40\\xa0km) in a single day, they would lose so much weight that they would be hard to sell when they reached the end of the trail. Usually they were taken shorter distances each day, allowed periods to rest and graze both at midday and at night.[50] On average, a herd could maintain a healthy weight moving about 15 miles (25\\xa0km) per day. Such a pace meant that it would take as long as two months to travel from a home ranch to a railhead. The Chisholm trail, for example, was 1,000 miles (1,600\\xa0km) miles long.[51]\\nOn average, a single herd of cattle on a drive numbered about 3,000 head. To herd the cattle, a crew of at least 10 cowboys was needed, with three horses per cowboy. Cowboys worked in shifts to watch the cattle 24 hours a day, herding them in the proper direction in the daytime and watching them at night to prevent stampedes and deter theft. The crew also included a cook, who drove a chuck wagon, usually pulled by oxen, and a horse wrangler to take charge of the remuda, or herd of spare horses. The wrangler on a cattle drive was often a very young cowboy or one of lower social status, but the cook was a particularly well-respected member of the crew, as not only was he in charge of the food, he also was in charge of medical supplies and had a working knowledge of practical medicine.[52]\\nBarbed wire, an innovation of the 1880s, allowed cattle to be confined to designated areas to prevent overgrazing of the range. In Texas and surrounding areas, increased population required ranchers to fence off their individual lands.[32] In the north, overgrazing stressed the open range, leading to insufficient winter forage for the cattle and starvation, particularly during the harsh winter of 1886–1887, when hundreds of thousands of cattle died across the Northwest, leading to collapse of the cattle industry.[53] By the 1890s, barbed-wire fencing was also standard in the northern plains, railroads had expanded to cover most of the nation, and meat packing plants were built closer to major ranching areas, making long cattle drives from Texas to the railheads in Kansas unnecessary. Hence, the age of the open range was gone and large cattle drives were over.[53] Smaller cattle drives continued at least into the 1940s, as ranchers, prior to the development of the modern cattle truck, still needed to herd cattle to local railheads for transport to stockyards and packing plants. Meanwhile, ranches multiplied all over the developing West, keeping cowboy employment high, if still low-paid, but also somewhat more settled.[54]\\nAmerican cowboys were drawn from multiple sources. By the late 1860s, following the American Civil War and the expansion of the cattle industry, former soldiers from both the Union and Confederacy came west, seeking work, as did large numbers of restless white men in general.[55] A significant number of African-American freedmen also were drawn to cowboy life, in part because there was not quite as much racial discrimination in the West as in other areas of American society at the time.[56] A significant number of Mexicans and American Indians already living in the region also worked as cowboys.[57] Later, particularly after 1890, when American policy promoted \"assimilation\" of Indian people, some Indian boarding schools also taught ranching skills. Today, some Native Americans in the western United States own cattle and small ranches, and many are still employed as cowboys, especially on ranches located near Indian reservations. The \"Indian Cowboy\" is also part of the rodeo circuit.\\nBecause cowboys ranked low in the social structure of the period, there are no firm figures on the actual proportion of various races. One writer states that cowboys were \"of two classes—those recruited from Texas and other States on the eastern slope; and Mexicans, from the south-western region\".[58] Census records suggest that about 15% of all cowboys were of African-American ancestry—ranging from about 25% on the trail drives out of Texas, to very few in the northwest. Similarly, cowboys of Mexican descent also averaged about 15% of the total, but were more common in Texas and the southwest. Some estimates suggest that in the late 19th century, one out of every three cowboys was a Mexican vaquero, and 20% may have been African-American.[26] Other estimates place the number of African-American cowboys as high as 25 percent.[59]\\nRegardless of ethnicity, most cowboys came from lower social classes and the pay was poor. The average cowboy earned approximately a dollar a day, plus food, and, when near the home ranch, a bed in the bunkhouse, usually a barracks-like building with a single open room.[60]\\nOver time, the cowboys of the American West developed a personal culture of their own, a blend of frontier and Victorian values that even retained vestiges of chivalry. Such hazardous work in isolated conditions also bred a tradition of self-dependence and individualism, with great value put on personal honesty, exemplified in songs and poetry.[61] The cowboy often worked in an all-male environment, particularly on cattle drives, and in the frontier west, men often significantly outnumbered women.[62]\\nSome men were attracted to the frontier by other men.[63] At times, in a region where men outnumbered women, even social events normally attended by both sexes were at times all male, and men could be found partnering up with one another for dances.[62] Homosexual acts between young, unmarried men occurred, but cowboys culture itself was and remains deeply homophobic. Though anti-sodomy laws were common in the Old West, they often were only selectively enforced.[64]\\nHeather Cox Richardson argues for a political dimension to the original cowboy image in the 1870s and 1880s:[65]The timing of the cattle industry\\'s growth meant that cowboy imagery grew to have extraordinary power. Entangled in the vicious politics of the postwar years, Democrats, especially those in the old Confederacy, imagined the West as a land untouched by Republican politicians they hated. They developed an image of the cowboys as men who worked hard, played hard, lived by a code of honor, protected themselves, and asked nothing of the government. In the hands of Democratic newspaper editors, the realities of cowboy life -- the poverty, the danger, the debilitating hours -- became romantic. Cowboys embodied virtues Democrats believed Republicans were destroying by creating a behemoth government catering to lazy ex-slaves. By the 1860s, cattle drives were a feature of the plains landscape, and Democrats had made cowboys a symbol of rugged individual independence, something they insisted Republicans were destroying. The traditions of the working cowboy were further etched into the minds of the general public with the development of Wild West shows in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which showcased and romanticized the life of both cowboys and Native Americans.[66] Beginning in the 1920s and continuing to the present day, Western films popularized the cowboy lifestyle but also formed persistent stereotypes. In some cases, the cowboy and the violent gunslinger are often associated with one another. On the other hand, some actors who portrayed cowboys promoted other values, such as the \"cowboy code\" of Gene Autry, that encouraged honorable behavior, respect and patriotism.[67] Historian Robert K. DeArment draws a connection between the popularized Western code and the stereotypical rowdy cowboy image to that of the \"subculture of violence\" of drovers in Old West Texas that was influenced itself by the Southern code duello.[68]\\nLikewise, cowboys in movies were often shown fighting with American Indians. Most armed conflicts occurred between Native people and cavalry units of the U.S. Army.  Relations between cowboys and Native Americans were varied but were generally unfriendly.[48][69] Native people usually allowed cattle herds to pass through for a toll of ten cents a head but raided cattle drives and ranches in times of active white-Native conflict or food shortages. In the 1860s, for example, the Comanche created problems in Western Texas.[70] Similar attacks also occurred with the Apache, Cheyenne and Ute Indians.[71] Cowboys were armed against both predators and human thieves, and often used their guns to drive away people of any race who attempted to rustle cattle.\\nIn reality, working ranch hands past and present had very little time for anything other than the constant hard work involved in maintaining a ranch.\\nThe history of women in the West, and women who worked on cattle ranches in particular, is not as well documented as is that of men. Institutions such as the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in modern years have attempted to gather and document the contributions of women.[2]\\nThere are few records mentioning girls or women working to drive cattle up the cattle trails of the Old West. Women performed considerable ranch work, and in some cases (especially when the men went to war or on embarked on long cattle drives) ran them. There is little doubt that women, particularly the wives and daughters of men who owned small ranches and could not afford to hire large numbers of outside laborers, worked side-by-side with men and thus needed to ride horses and perform related tasks. The largely undocumented contributions of women to the West were acknowledged in law; the Western states led the United States in granting women the right to vote, beginning with Wyoming in 1869.[72] Early photographers such as Evelyn Cameron documented the life of working ranch women during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\\nWhile impractical for everyday work, the sidesaddle was a tool that afforded women the ability to ride horses in public settings instead of being left on foot or confined to horse-drawn vehicles. Following the Civil War, Charles Goodnight modified the traditional English sidesaddle, creating a western-styled design. The traditional charras of Mexico preserve a similar tradition and ride sidesaddles today in charreada exhibitions on both sides of the border.\\nIt was not until the advent of Wild West shows that \"cowgirls\" came into their own. These adult women were skilled performers, demonstrating riding, expert marksmanship and trick roping that entertained audiences around the world. Women such as Annie Oakley became household names. By 1900, skirts split for riding astride became popular and allowed women to compete with men without scandalizing Victorian-era audiences by wearing men\\'s clothing or bloomers. In the films that followed beginning in the early 20th century, the role of the cowgirl was expanded in popular culture and film set designers developed attractive clothing suitable for riding Western saddles.\\nIndependently of the entertainment industry, the growth of rodeo brought about the rodeo cowgirl. In the early Wild West shows and rodeos, women competed in all events, sometimes against other women, sometimes with the men. Cowgirls such as Fannie Sperry Steele rode the same \"rough stock\" and assumed the same risks as the men (and all while wearing a heavy split skirt that was more encumbering than men\\'s trousers) and competed at major rodeos such as the Calgary Stampede and Cheyenne Frontier Days.[73]\\nRodeo competition for women changed in the 1920s as the result of several factors. After 1925, when Eastern promoters started staging indoor rodeos in places like Madison Square Garden, women were generally excluded from the men\\'s events and many of the women\\'s events were dropped. Also, many in the public had difficulties with seeing women seriously injured or killed, and in particular, the death of Bonnie McCarroll at the 1929 Pendleton Round-Up led to the elimination of women\\'s bronc riding from rodeo competition.[74]\\nIn today\\'s rodeos, men and women compete equally together only in the event of team roping, although women could now enter other open events. In all-women rodeos, women compete in bronc riding, bull riding and all other traditional rodeo events. In open rodeos, cowgirls primarily compete in the timed riding events such as barrel racing, and most professional rodeos do not offer as many women\\'s events as they do men\\'s events.\\nBoys and girls are more apt to compete against one another in all events in high-school rodeos as well as O-Mok-See competition, where boys can be seen in events traditionally associated with women riders, such as barrel racing. Outside of the rodeo world, women compete equally with men in nearly all other equestrian events, including the Olympics, and Western riding events such as cutting, reining and endurance riding.\\nToday\\'s working cowgirls generally use clothing, tools and equipment indistinguishable from those of men, other than in color and design, usually preferring a flashier look in competition. Sidesaddles are only seen in exhibitions and a limited number of specialty horse-show classes. A modern working cowgirl wears jeans, close-fitting shirts, boots, hat and when needed, chaps and gloves. If working on the ranch, they perform the same chores as cowboys and dress to suit the situation.\\nGeography, climate and cultural traditions caused differences to develop in cattle-handling methods and equipment from one part of the United States to another. The period between 1840 and 1870 marked a mingling of cultures when English and French-descended people began to settle west of the Mississippi River and encountered the Spanish-descended people who had settled in the parts of Mexico that later became Texas and California.[75]  In the modern world, remnants of two major and distinct cowboy traditions remain, known today as the \"Texas\" tradition and the \"Spanish\", \"Vaquero\", or \"California\" tradition. Less well-known but equally distinct traditions also developed in Hawaii and Florida. Today, the various regional cowboy traditions have merged to some extent, though a few regional differences in equipment and riding style still remain, and some individuals choose to deliberately preserve the more time-consuming but highly skilled techniques of the pure vaquero or \"buckaroo\" tradition. The popular \"horse whisperer\" style of natural horsemanship was originally developed by practitioners who were predominantly from California and the Northwestern states, clearly combining the attitudes and philosophy of the California vaquero with the equipment and outward look of the Texas cowboy.\\nThe vaquero, the Spanish or Mexican cowboy who worked with young, untrained horses, arrived in the 18th century and flourished in Alta California and bordering territories during the Spanish Colonial period.[76] Settlers from the United States did not enter California in significant numbers until after the Mexican–American War, and most early settlers were miners rather than livestock ranchers, leaving livestock-raising largely to the Spanish and Mexican people who chose to remain in California. The California vaquero or buckaroo, unlike the Texas cowboy, was considered a highly skilled worker, who usually stayed on the same ranch where he was born or had grown up and raised his own family there. In addition, the geography and climate of much of California was dramatically different from that of Texas, allowing more intensive grazing with less open range, plus cattle in California were marketed primarily at a regional level, without the need (nor, until much later, even the logistical possibility) to be driven hundreds of miles to railroad lines. Thus, a horse- and livestock-handling culture remained in California and the Pacific Northwest that retained a stronger direct Spanish influence than that of Texas. The modern distinction between vaquero and buckaroo within American English may also reflect the parallel differences between the California and Texas traditions of western horsemanship.[77]\\nSome cowboys of the California tradition were dubbed buckaroos by English-speaking settlers. The words \"buckaroo\" and vaquero are still used on occasion in the Great Basin, parts of California and, less often, in the Pacific Northwest. Elsewhere, the term \"cowboy\" is more common.[78]\\nThe word buckaroo is generally believed to be an anglicized version of vaquero and shows phonological characteristics compatible with that origin.[79][80][81][82] Buckaroo first appeared in American English in 1827.[83]  The word may also have developed with influences from the English word \"buck\" or bucking, the behavior of young, untrained horses.[80] In 1960, one etymologist suggested that buckaroo derives, through Gullah: buckra, from the Ibibio and Efik: mbakara, meaning \"white man, master, boss\".[84] Although that derivation was later rejected, another possibility advanced was that \"buckaroo\" was a pun on vaquero, blending both Spanish and African sources.[79][80]\\nIn the 18th century, people in Spanish Texas began to herd cattle on horseback to sell in Louisiana, both legally and illegally.[85]  By the early 19th century, the Spanish Crown, and later, independent Mexico, offered empresario grants in what would later be Texas to non-citizens, such as settlers from the United States. In 1821, Stephen F. Austin led a group which became the first English-speaking Mexican citizens.[86] Following Texas independence in 1836, even more Americans immigrated into the empresario ranching areas of Texas. Here the settlers were strongly influenced by the Mexican vaquero culture, borrowing vocabulary and attire from their counterparts,[87] but also retaining some of the livestock-handling traditions and culture of the Eastern United States and Great Britain. The Texas cowboy was typically a bachelor who hired on with different outfits from season to season.[88]\\nFollowing the American Civil War, vaquero culture combined with the cattle herding and drover traditions of the southeastern United States that evolved as settlers moved west. Additional influences developed out of Texas as cattle trails were created to meet up with the railroad lines of Kansas and Nebraska, in addition to expanding ranching opportunities in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain Front, east of the Continental Divide.[89]  The new settlers required more horses, to be trained faster, and brought a bigger and heavier horse with them.  This led to modifications in the bridling and bitting traditions used by the vaquero.[90]  Thus, the Texas cowboy tradition arose from a combination of cultural influences, in addition to the need for adaptation to the geography and climate of west Texas and the need to conduct long cattle drives to get animals to market.\\nHistorian Terry Jordan proposed in 1982 that some Texan traditions that developed—particularly after the Civil War—may trace to colonial South Carolina, as most settlers to Texas were from the southeastern United States.[91][92][93][94] These theories have been questioned by some reviewers.[95]  In a subsequent work, Jordan also noted that the influence of post-War Texas upon the whole of the frontier Western cowboy tradition was likely much less than previously thought.[96][97]\\nThe Florida \"cowhunter\" or \"cracker cowboy\" of the 19th and early 20th centuries was distinct from the Texas and California traditions. Florida cowboys did not use lassos to herd or capture cattle. Their primary tools were bullwhips and dogs. Since the Florida cowhunter did not need a saddle horn for anchoring a lariat, many did not use Western saddles, instead using a McClellan saddle. While some individuals wore boots that reached above the knees for protection from snakes, others wore brogans. They usually wore inexpensive wool or straw hats, and used ponchos for protection from rain.[98]\\nCattle and horses were introduced into Spanish Florida in the 16th century,[99] and flourished throughout the 17th century.[100] The cattle introduced by the Spanish persist today in two rare breeds: Florida Cracker cattle and Pineywoods cattle.[101] The Florida Cracker Horse, which is still used by some Florida cowboys, is descended from horses introduced by the Spanish.[102] From shortly after 1565 until the end of the 17th century, cattle ranches owned by Spanish officials and missions operated in northern Florida to supply the Spanish garrison in St. Augustine and markets in Cuba. Raids into Spanish Florida by the Province of Carolina and its Native American allies, which wiped out the native population of Florida, led to the collapse of the Spanish mission and ranching systems.[103][104]\\nIn the 18th century, Creek, Seminole, and other Indian people moved into the depopulated areas of Florida and started herding the cattle left from the Spanish ranches. In the 19th century, most tribes in the area were dispossessed of their land and cattle and pushed south or west by white settlers and the United States government. By the middle of the 19th century white ranchers were running large herds of cattle on the extensive open range of central and southern Florida. The hides and meat from Florida cattle became such a critical supply item for the Confederacy during the American Civil War that a unit of Cow Cavalry was organized to round up and protect the herds from Union raiders.[105] After the Civil War, and into the 20th Century, Florida cattle were periodically driven to ports on the Gulf of Mexico, such as Punta Rassa near Fort Myers, Florida, and shipped to market in Cuba.[106]\\nThe Florida cowhunter or cracker cowboy tradition gradually assimilated to western cowboy tradition during the 20th century. Texas tick fever and the screw-worm were introduced to Florida in the early 20th century by cattle entering from other states. These pests forced Florida cattlemen to separate individual animals from their herds at frequent intervals for treatment, which eventually led to the widespread use of lassos. Florida cowboys continue to use dogs and bullwhips for controlling cattle.[107]\\nThe Hawaiian cowboy, the paniolo, is also a direct descendant of the vaquero of California and Mexico. Experts in Hawaiian etymology believe \"Paniolo\" is a Hawaiianized pronunciation of español. (The Hawaiian language has no /s/ sound, and all syllables and words must end in a vowel.) Paniolo, like cowboys on the mainland of North America, learned their skills from Mexican vaqueros.[108] Other theories of word origin suggest Paniolo was derived from pañuelo (Spanish for handkerchief) or possibly from a Hawai\\'ian language word meaning \"hold firmly and sway gracefully\".[109]\\nCaptain George Vancouver brought cattle and sheep in 1793 as a gift to Kamehameha I, monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom. For ten years, Kamehameha forbade killing of cattle, and imposed the death penalty on anyone who violated his edict.  As a result, numbers  multiplied astonishingly, and were wreaking havoc throughout the countryside. By the reign of Kamehameha III the number of wild cattle were becoming a problem, so in 1832 he sent an emissary to California, then still a part of Mexico. He was impressed with the skill of the vaqueros, and invited three to Hawai\\'i  to teach the Hawaiian people how to work cattle.[109]\\nThe first horses arrived in Hawai\\'i in 1803. By 1837 John Parker, a sailor from New England who settled in the islands, received permission from Kamehameha III to lease royal land near Mauna Kea, where he built a ranch.[109]\\nThe Hawaiian style of ranching originally included capturing wild cattle by driving them into pits dug in the forest floor. Once tamed somewhat by hunger and thirst, they were hauled out up a steep ramp, and tied by their horns to the horns of a tame, older steer (or ox) that knew where the paddock with food and water was located. The industry grew slowly under the reign of Kamehameha\\'s son Liholiho (Kamehameha II).\\nEven today, traditional paniolo dress, as well as certain styles of Hawaiian formal attire, reflect the Spanish heritage of the vaquero.[110] The traditional Hawaiian saddle, the noho lio,[111] and many other tools of the cowboy\\'s trade have a distinctly Mexican/Spanish look and many Hawaiian ranching families still carry the names of the vaqueros who married Hawaiian women and made Hawai\\'i their home.\\nOn the Eastern Shore of Virginia, the \"Salt Water Cowboys\" are known for rounding up the feral Chincoteague Ponies from Assateague Island and driving them across Assateague Channel into pens on Chincoteague Island during the annual Pony Penning.\\nRanching in Canada has traditionally been dominated by the province of Alberta. The most successful early settlers of the province were the ranchers, who found Alberta\\'s foothills to be ideal for raising cattle. Most of Alberta\\'s ranchers were English settlers, but cowboys such as John Ware—who brought the first cattle into the province in 1876—were American.[112] American style open range dryland ranching began to dominate southern Alberta (and, to a lesser extent, southwestern Saskatchewan) by the 1880s. The nearby city of Calgary became the centre of the Canadian cattle industry, earning it the nickname \"Cowtown\". The cattle industry is still extremely important to Alberta, and cattle outnumber people in the province. While cattle ranches defined by barbed-wire fences replaced the open range just as they did in the US, the cowboy influence lives on. Canada\\'s first rodeo, the Raymond Stampede, was established in 1902. In 1912, the Calgary Stampede began, and today it is the world\\'s richest cash rodeo. Each year, Calgary\\'s northern rival Edmonton, Alberta stages the Canadian Finals Rodeo, and dozens of regional rodeos are held through the province. British Columbia also has a significant ranching history and cowboy culture in the interior, and has been home to the Williams Lake Stampede since 1920.[113]\\nThe necessity for horse riders who guard herds of cattle, sheep or horses is common wherever wide, open land for grazing exists. In the French Camargue, riders called \"gardians\" herd cattle and horses. In Hungary, csikós guard horses and gulyás tend to cattle. The herders in the region of Maremma, in Tuscany (Italy) are called butteri (singular: buttero). The Asturian pastoral population is referred to as vaqueiros de alzada.\\nThe Spanish exported their horsemanship and knowledge of cattle ranching not only to North America, but also to South America, where traditions developed such as the gaucho of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and (with the spelling gaúcho) southern Brazil,[114] the chalán and Morochuco in Peru, the llanero of Venezuela, and the huaso of Chile.\\nIn Australia, where ranches are known as stations, cowboys are known as stockmen and ringers, (jackaroos and jillaroos who also do stockwork are trainee overseers and property managers).[115] The Australian droving tradition was influenced by Americans in the 19th century, and as well as practices imported directly from Spain. The adaptation of both of these traditions to local needs created a unique Australian tradition, which also was strongly influenced by Australian indigenous people, whose knowledge played a key role in the success of cattle ranching in Australia\\'s climate.\\nOn the ranch, the cowboy is responsible for feeding the livestock, branding and earmarking cattle (horses also are branded on many ranches), plus tending to animal injuries and other needs. The working cowboy usually is in charge of a small group or \"string\" of horses and is required to routinely patrol the rangeland in all weather conditions checking for damaged fences, evidence of predation, water problems, and any other issue of concern.\\nThey also move the livestock to different pasture locations, or herd them into corrals and onto trucks for transport. In addition, cowboys may do many other jobs, depending on the size of the \"outfit\" or ranch, the terrain, and the number of livestock. On a smaller ranch with fewer cowboys—often just family members, cowboys are generalists who perform many all-around tasks; they repair fences, maintain ranch equipment, and perform other odd jobs. On a very large ranch (a \"big outfit\"), with many employees, cowboys are able to specialize on tasks solely related to cattle and horses. Cowboys who train horses often specialize in this task only, and some may \"Break\" or train young horses for more than one ranch.\\nThe United States Bureau of Labor Statistics collects no figures for “cowboys” per se, and the definition is broad, encompassing ranch hands to rodeo performers, so the exact number of working cowboys is unknown. Working cowboys or ranch hands  are included in the 2003 category, Support activities for animal production, which totals 9,730 workers averaging $19,340 per annum. In addition to cowboys working on ranches, in stockyards, and as staff or competitors at rodeos, the category includes farmhands working with other types of livestock (sheep, goats, hogs, chickens, etc.). Of those 9,730 workers, 3,290 are listed in the subcategory of Spectator sports which includes rodeos, circuses, and theaters needing livestock handlers.\\nMost cowboy attire, sometimes termed Western wear, grew out of practical need and the environment in which the cowboy worked. Most items were adapted from the Mexican vaqueros, though sources from other cultures, including Native Americans and mountain men contributed.[116]\\nMany of these items show marked regional variations. Parameters such as hat brim width, or chap length and material were adjusted to accommodate the various environmental conditions encountered by working cowboys.\\nThe traditional means of transport for the cowboy, even in the modern era, is by horseback. Horses can travel over terrain that vehicles cannot access. Horses, along with mules and burros, also serve as pack animals. The most important horse on the ranch is the everyday working ranch horse that can perform a wide variety of tasks; horses trained to specialize exclusively in one set of skills such as roping or cutting are very rarely used on ranches. Because the rider often needs to keep one hand free while working cattle, the horse must neck rein and have good cow sense—it must instinctively know how to anticipate and react to cattle.\\nA good stock horse is on the small side, generally under 15.2 hands (62\\xa0inches) tall at the withers and often under 1000 pounds, with a short back, sturdy legs and strong muscling, particularly in the hindquarters. While a steer roping horse may need to be larger and weigh more in order to hold a heavy adult cow, bull or steer on a rope, a smaller, quick horse is needed for herding activities such as cutting or calf roping. The horse has to be intelligent, calm under pressure and have a certain degree of \\'cow sense\" – the ability to anticipate the movement and behavior of cattle.\\nMany breeds of horse make good stock horses, but the most common today in North America is the American Quarter Horse, which is a horse breed developed primarily in Texas from a combination of Thoroughbred bloodstock crossed on horses of mustang and other Iberian horse ancestry, with influences from the Arabian horse and horses developed on the east coast, such as the Morgan horse and now-extinct breeds such as the Chickasaw and Virginia Quarter-Miler.\\nEquipment used to ride a horse is referred to as tack and includes:\\nThe most common motorized vehicle driven in modern ranch work is the pickup truck. Sturdy and roomy, with a high ground clearance, and often four-wheel drive capability, it has an open box, called a \"bed\", and can haul supplies from town or over rough trails on the ranch. It is used to pull stock trailers transporting cattle and livestock from one area to another and to market. With a horse trailer attached, it carries horses to distant areas where they may be needed. Motorcycles are sometimes used instead of horses for some tasks, but the most common smaller vehicle is the four-wheeler. It will carry a single cowboy quickly around the ranch for small chores. In areas with heavy snowfall, snowmobiles are also common. Some jobs remain, particularly working cattle in rough terrain or close quarters, that are best performed by cowboys on horseback.\\nThe word rodeo is from the Spanish rodear (to turn), which means roundup. In the beginning there was no difference between the working cowboy and the rodeo cowboy, and in fact, the term working cowboy did not come into use until the 1950s. Prior to that it was assumed that all cowboys were working cowboys. Early cowboys both worked on ranches and displayed their skills at the roundups.[121]\\nThe advent of professional rodeos allowed cowboys, like many athletes, to earn a living by performing their skills before an audience. Rodeos also provided employment for many working cowboys who were needed to handle livestock. Many rodeo cowboys are also working cowboys and most have working cowboy experience.\\nThe dress of the rodeo cowboy is not very different from that of the working cowboy on his way to town. Snaps, used in lieu of buttons on the cowboy\\'s shirt, allowed the cowboy to escape from a shirt snagged by the horns of steer or bull. Styles were often adapted from the early movie industry for the rodeo. Some rodeo competitors, particularly women, add sequins, colors, silver and long fringes to their clothing in both a nod to tradition and showmanship. Modern riders in \"rough stock\" events such as saddle bronc or bull riding may add safety equipment such as kevlar vests or a neck brace, but use of safety helmets in lieu of the cowboy hat is yet to be accepted, in spite of constant risk of injury.\\nAs the frontier ended, the cowboy life came to be highly romanticized. Exhibitions such as those of Buffalo Bill Cody\\'s Wild West Show helped to popularize the image of the cowboy as an idealized representative of the tradition of chivalry.[122]\\nIn today\\'s society, there is little understanding of the daily realities of actual agricultural life.[123] Cowboys are more often associated with (mostly fictitious) Indian-fighting than with their actual life of ranch work and cattle-tending. The cowboy is also portrayed as a masculine ideal via images ranging from the Marlboro Man to the Village People. Actors such as John Wayne are thought of as exemplifying a cowboy ideal, even though western movies seldom bear much resemblance to real cowboy life. Arguably, the modern rodeo competitor is much closer to being an actual cowboy, as many were actually raised on ranches and around livestock, and the rest have needed to learn livestock-handling skills on the job.\\nIn the United States, the Canadian West and Australia, guest ranches offer people the opportunity to ride horses and get a taste of the western life—albeit in far greater comfort. Some ranches also offer vacationers the opportunity to actually perform cowboy tasks by participating in cattle drives or accompanying wagon trains. This type of vacation was popularized by the 1991 movie City Slickers, starring Billy Crystal.\\nIn 2005, the United States Senate declared the fourth Saturday of July as \"National Day of the American Cowboy\" via a Senate resolution and has subsequently renewed this resolution each year, with the United States House of Representatives periodically issuing statements of support.[124]\\nThe long history of the West in popular culture tends to define those clothed in Western clothing as cowboys or cowgirls whether they have ever been on a horse or not. This is especially true when applied to entertainers and those in the public arena who wear Western wear as part of their persona. Many other people, particularly in the West, including lawyers, bankers, and other white collar professionals wear elements of Western clothing, particularly cowboy boots or hats, as a matter of form even though they have other jobs. Conversely, some people raised on ranches do not necessarily define themselves cowboys or cowgirls unless they feel their primary job is to work with livestock or if they compete in rodeos.\\nActual cowboys have derisive expressions for individuals who adopt cowboy mannerisms as a fashion pose without any actual understanding of the culture. For example, a \"drugstore cowboy\" means someone who wears the clothing but does not actually sit upon anything but the stool of the drugstore soda fountain—or, in modern times, a bar stool. Similarly, the phrase \"all hat and no cattle\" is used to describe someone (usually male) who boasts about himself, far in excess of any actual accomplishments.[125] The word \"dude\" (or the now-archaic term \"greenhorn\") indicates an individual unfamiliar with cowboy culture, especially one who is trying to pretend otherwise.\\nOutside of the United States, the cowboy has become an archetypal image of Americans abroad.[126] In the late 1950s, a Congolese youth subculture calling themselves the Bills based their style and outlook on Hollywood\\'s depiction of cowboys in movies.[127] Something similar occurred with the term \"Apache\", which in early 20th century Parisian society was a slang term for an outlaw.[128]\\nThe word \"cowboy\" is sometimes used pejoratively. Originally this derived from the behavior of some cowboys in the boomtowns of Kansas, at the end of the trail for long cattle drives, where cowboys developed a reputation for violence and wild behavior due to the inevitable impact of large numbers of cowboys, mostly young single men, receiving their pay in large lump sums upon arriving in communities with many drinking and gambling establishments.[129]\\n\"Cowboy\" as an adjective for \"reckless\" developed in the 1920s.[7] \"Cowboy\" is sometimes used today in a derogatory sense to describe someone who is reckless or ignores potential risks, irresponsible or who heedlessly handles a sensitive or dangerous task.[5] Time magazine referred to President George W. Bush\\'s foreign policy as \"Cowboy diplomacy\",[130] and Bush has been described in the press, particularly in Europe, as a \"cowboy\", not realizing that this was not a compliment.\\nIn English-speaking regions outside North America, such as the British Isles and Australasia, \"cowboy\" can refer to a tradesman whose work is of shoddy and questionable value, e.g., \"a cowboy plumber\".[131] The term also lent itself to the British 1980s TV sitcom, Cowboys. Similar usage is seen in the United States to describe someone in the skilled trades who operates without proper training or licenses. In the eastern United States, \"cowboy\" as a noun is sometimes used to describe a fast or careless driver on the highway.[5][132][133]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nGunfighters, also called gunslingers (/ˈɡʌnslɪŋər/) or in the late 19th and early 20th century  gunmen, were individuals in the American Old West who gained a reputation of being dangerous with a gun and participated in shootouts. Today, the term \"gunslinger\" is more or less used to denote someone who is quick on the draw with a handgun, but this can also refer to those armed with rifles and shotguns. The gunfighter is also one of the most popular characters in the Western genre and has appeared in associated films, television shows, video games, and literature.\\nA gunfighter could be a lawman, outlaw, cowboy, or shooting exhibitionist, but the professional gunfighter was a mercenary \"hired gun\" (cf. freelancer) who made a living with his weapons in the Old West, selling his services to the highest bidder.[1]\\nThe term \"gunslinger\" was used in the Western film Drag Harlan (1920).[2] The word was soon adopted by other Western writers, such as Zane Grey, and became common usage. In his introduction to The Shootist (1976), author Glendon Swarthout says \"gunslinger\" and \"gunfighter\" are modern terms, and the more authentic terms for the period would have been \"gunman\", \"pistoleer\", \"shootist\", or \"bad man\" (sometimes written as \"badman\"). Swarthout seems to have been correct about \"gunslinger\", but the term \"gunfighter\" existed in several newspapers in the 1870s, and as such the term existed in the 19th century.[3] Bat Masterson used the term \"gunfighter\" in the newspaper articles which he wrote about the lawmen and outlaws whom he had known. However, Joseph Rosa noted that, even though Masterson used the term \"gunfighter\", he \"preferred the term \\'mankiller\\'\" when discussing these individuals.[4] Clay Allison (1841–1887), a notorious New Mexico and Texas gunman and cattleman, originated the term \"shootist\".[5]\\nOften, the term has been applied to men who would hire out for contract killings or at a ranch embroiled in a range war where they would earn \"fighting wages\".[3] Others, like Billy the Kid, were notorious bandits, and still others were lawmen like Pat Garrett and Wyatt Earp. A gunfighter could be an outlaw—a robber or murderer who took advantage of the wilderness of the frontier to hide from genteel society and to make periodic raids on it. The gunfighter could also be an agent of the state, archetypically a lone avenger, but more often a sheriff, whose duty was to face the outlaw and bring him to justice or to personally administer it. There were also a few historical cowboys who were actual gunfighters, such as the Cochise County Cowboys who participated in the bloody 1879 Skeleton Canyon massacre.[6]\\nGunslingers frequently appear as stock characters in Western movies and novels, along with cowboys. Often, the hero of a Western meets his opposite \"double\", a mirror of his own evil side that he has to destroy.\\n[7]\\nWestern gunslinger heroes are portrayed as local lawmen or enforcement officers, ranchers, army officers, cowboys, territorial marshals, nomadic loners, or skilled fast-draw artists. They are normally masculine persons of integrity and principle – courageous, moral, tough, solid, and self-sufficient, maverick characters (often with trusty sidekicks), possessing an independent and honorable attitude (but often characterized as slow-talking).[8] They are depicted as similar to a knight-errant, wandering from place to place with no particular direction, often facing curious and hostile enemies, while saving individuals or communities from those enemies in terms of chivalry. The Western hero usually stands alone and faces danger on his own, commonly against lawlessness, with an expert display of his physical skills (roping, gun-play, horse-handling, pioneering abilities, etc.).[7]\\nIn films, the gunslinger often possesses a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver. Twirling pistols, lightning draws, and trick shots are standard fare for the gunmen of the big screen.[1] In the real world, however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did not shoot to disarm or to impress, but to kill.[1]\\nAnother classic bit of cinema that is largely a myth is the showdown at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, as in the case of the Luke Short–Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke.[9] Gunfights could be won by simple distraction or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. \\nWhen a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off.[1] The gunslinger\\'s reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.[1]\\nIn the days of the Old West, tales tended to grow with repeated telling, and a single fight might grow into a career-making reputation.[1][10] For instance, the gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Cochise County Cowboys, but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion. Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing unarmed civilians.[citation needed]\\nMost gunfights are portrayed in films or books as having two men square off, waiting for one to make the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover.[11]\\nIn popular folklore, men who held noteworthy reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible.[1] They rarely took undue risks and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.[citation needed]\\nThese fights were usually close-up and personal, with a number of shots blasted from pistols, often resulting in innocent bystanders hit by bullets gone wild. Much of the time, it would be difficult to tell who had \"won\" the gunfight for several minutes, as the black powder smoke from the pistols cleared the air.[10] How famous gunfighters died is as varied as each man. Many well-known gunfighters were so feared by the public because of their reputation that when they were killed, they died as a result of ambush rather than going down in a \"blaze of glory\".[12] Others died secluded deaths either from old age or illness.[citation needed]\\nMythology and folklore often exaggerate the skills of famous gunfighters. Most of these historical figures were not known to be capable of trick shooting, nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting. Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent\\'s belt buckle (thus dropping his pants), a bullet cutting the hangman\\'s rope, or shooting the guns out of opponents\\' hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The last was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can hurt or even kill.[13] Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.[14]\\nIn Western movies, the characters\\' gun belts are often worn low on the hip and outer thigh, with the holster cut away around the pistol\\'s trigger and grip for a smooth, fast draw. This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism.[15] Fast-draw artists can be distinguished from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets and waistbands.[9]\\nWild Bill Hickok popularized the butt-forward holster type, which worked better on horseback.[15] Other gunfighters would use bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw.[16] Revolvers were a popular weapon to gunfighters who were horsemen, cowboys, and lawmen because of their concealability and effectiveness on horseback.[1] The Winchester rifle was also a popular weapon among gunfighters. Dubbed the \"Gun that Won the West\", it was widely used during the settlement of the American frontier. Shotguns were also a popular weapon for \"express messengers\" and guards, especially those on stagecoaches and trains who were in charge of overseeing and guarding a valuable private shipment.[citation needed]\\nQuick draw and hip shooting were rare skills in the West,[17] and only a handful of historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, and Wild Bill Hickok.[9][15] Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers,[18] and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight,[19] while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.[20]\\nGunfighters King Fisher, John Wesley Hardin, Ben Thompson, Billy the Kid, Wild Bill Hickok, and Pat Garrett all died as a result of ambushes, killed by men who feared them because of their reputation.[10] Gunmen Kid Curry, Jim Courtright, Dallas Stoudenmire and Dave Rudabaugh were killed in raging gun battles, much as portrayed in films about the era, and usually against more than one opponent. Bill Longley and Tom Horn were executed. Famed gunman Clay Allison died in a wagon accident. Gunmen Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Bass Reeves, Commodore Perry Owens, and Luke Short all died of natural causes, living out their lives on reputation and avoiding conflict in secluded retirement. Gunfighter and lawman Frank Eaton, known as \"Pistol Pete\" lived into old age and gained further fame, before his death at age 97, by becoming the mascot for Oklahoma A&M College (now Oklahoma State University). Rare are the gunfighters who, like William Sidney \"Cap\" Light, died accidentally by their own hand.[10]\\nThe most important lesson I learned ... was that the winner of a gunplay usually was the one who took his time. The second was that, if I hoped to live on the frontier, I would shun flashy trick-shooting—grandstand play—as I would poison ... In all my life as a frontier peace officer, I did not know a really proficient gunfighter who had anything but contempt for the gun-fanner, or the man who literally shot from the hip...[15]\\n– Wyatt EarpThe image of a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth generated primarily by dime-novel authors in the late 19th century. An estimate of 20,000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900,[21] and over 21,586 total casualties during the American Indian Wars from 1850 to 1890.[22] The most notable and well-known took place in the states/territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.[23]\\nActual gunfights in the Old West were very rare, very few and far between, but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied.[9] Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment, while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen. Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and clashes with Indians were also a cause.[10] Some of these shootouts became famous, while others faded into history with only a few accounts surviving. To prevent gunfights from happening, many cities in the American frontier, such as Dodge City and Tombstone, put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in the area.[24]\\nThe gunfight at the O.K. Corral is a famous example of a real-life western shootout, between the Earp Brothers together with Doc Holliday, and the Clanton-McLaury gang. It lasted only 30 seconds, contrary to many movie adaptations.[25] The gunfight itself did not actually happen in the corral but in a vacant lot outside of it. The shooting started when Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury cocked their pistols. Both parties simultaneously drew their guns, which added to the confusion about who fired first. \\nIt is not known who fired the first shot, but Wyatt\\'s bullet was the first to hit, tearing through Frank McLaury\\'s belly and sending McLaury\\'s own shot wild through Wyatt\\'s coattail. Billy Clanton fired at Virgil, but his shot also went astray when he was hit with Morgan\\'s shot through his ribcage. Billy Claiborne ran as soon as shots were fired and was already out of sight. Ike Clanton panicked as well and ran towards Wyatt pleading for his life. \"Go to fighting or get away!\", Wyatt yelled and watched Ike desert his brother Billy and run. Doc instantly killed Tom McLaury with blasts from his shotgun. Frank was running to Fremont Street, and he challenged Holliday for killing his brother, but Doc dropped his shotgun, drew his pistol, and shot Frank in the right temple.[26] Wounded and dying, Billy Clanton fired blindly into the gun smoke encircling him, striking Virgil\\'s leg. Wyatt responded by sending several rounds into Billy.[citation needed]\\nOn April 14, 1881, lawman Dallas Stoudenmire participated in a gunfight in El Paso, Texas which many dubbed the Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight, in which he killed three of the four fatalities with his twin .44 caliber Colt revolvers. One of those killed was an innocent Mexican bystander.[27] Less than a year after these incidents, he would kill as many as six more men in gunfights while in the line of duty.[citation needed]\\nAnother well-documented gunfight resulted in the most kills by one person in a single event, when Capt. Jonathan R. Davis shot eleven bandits single-handedly on 19 December 1854.[19] Unknown to Davis and his companions, a band of robbers was lying in wait in the canyon brush near the trail. They were a typically diverse and motley group of Gold Rush bandits: two Americans, one Frenchman, two Britons, five Sydney Ducks, and four Mexicans. As Captain Davis and his companions trudged on foot, the bandit gang charged out of the brush, pistols flaming. James McDonald died instantly, without time to draw his revolver or react in any way.Dr. Bolivar managed to get his six-shooter out and fire twice at the highwaymen before he dropped, badly wounded. Captain Davis later described himself as being \"in a fever of excitement at the time.\" Unfazed, he stood his ground, pulling out both pistols and firing a barrage at the charging outlaws. He shot down his assailants, one after another. The outlaws\\' bullets tore at Davis\\'s clothing but caused only two slight flesh wounds. \\nWithin moments, seven of the bandits were dead or dying on the ground and Davis\\'s pistols were empty. Four of the remaining robbers now closed in on the captain to finish him off. Davis whipped out his Bowie knife and quickly warded off the thrusts from the two of the bandits. He stabbed one of them to death; the other he disarmed by knocking the knife from his grasp and slicing off his nose and a finger of his right hand. The two last attackers were the men who had been wounded in a previous bandit raid. Despite their weakened condition, they foolishly approached Davis with drawn knives. The captain reacted in an instant. Slashing with his heavy Bowie, he killed them both.[citation needed]\\nOn December 1, 1884, a town sheriff named Elfego Baca came face-to-face against 80 gunmen which became known as the Frisco shootout. The battle started when Baca arrested a cowboy who had shot him. In turn, the cowboy called upon 80 of his associates to murder Baca. Baca took refuge in an adobe house, and over the course of a 36-hour siege, the gunmen put 400 bullet holes in the house (some accounts say a total of 4,000 shots) without touching Baca. He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8. When the shooting was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo, Baca strolled out of the house unscathed. Baca went on to a distinguished career as a lawyer and legislator and died in his bed in 1945, at age 80.[25]\\nIn January 1887, Commodore Perry Owens took office as Sheriff of Apache County, Arizona. He sent two deputies to arrest Ike Clanton. Clanton had instigated the Gunfight at the OK Corral and was charged with the later ambush shooting of Virgil Earp. Wyatt Earp searched for Ike Clanton in his vendetta, but never found him – Ike moved north to Apache County to continue rustling cattle and killing. Owens\\' two deputies killed Ike Clanton; Phin Clanton was arrested; three other gang members were killed; and the Clanton gang was done. Then Sheriff Owens turned his attention to the Blevins family, the other rustling gang in the county. \\nIn June 1887 Old Man Blevins disappeared, presumably killed by the Tewksbury faction of the Pleasant Valley War. The Blevins sons searched for their father and in August Hamp Blevins and another were killed by the Tewksbury side. So Andy Blevins (aka Cooper) ambushed and killed John Tewksbury and Bill Jacobs in revenge. Blevins returned to Holbrook and was heard bragging about his killings. \\nSheriff Owens had inherited a warrant for Andy Blevins\\' (Cooper) arrest for horse theft so he rode to Holbook on September 2, 1887. Sheriff Owens had hunted buffalo for the railroad and could shoot his Winchester from the hip with great accuracy. Cradling his Winchester rifle in his arm, Sheriff Owens knocked on the Blevins\\' door. Andy Blevins answered with a pistol in hand, the lawman told him to come out, that he had a warrant for arrest. Blevins refused and tried to close the door. Owens shot his rifle from his hip through the door, hitting Andy Blevins in the stomach. Andy\\'s half-brother, John Blevins, pushed a pistol out the door to Owens\\' right and fired at the Sheriff. He missed and Owens shot John Blevins in the arm, putting him out of the fight. Owens saw Andy Blevins in the window moving to shoot back. Owens shot through the wall, striking Andy in the right hip – he died that night. Mose Roberts, boarding with the family, jumped out of a side window with a pistol. Sheriff Owens shot him through his back and chest, killing him. Fifteen-year-old Samuel Houston Blevins ran out the front door, with his brother\\'s revolver, and yelled \"I\\'ll get him.\" His mother ran out after him. Owens shot and Sam fell backward, dying in his mother\\'s arms. The shootout took less than one minute and made Owens a legend. In eight months Sheriff Owens had rid Apache County of two notorious gangs of rustlers and killers.[citation needed]\\nIn many early western films and literature, Native Americans were often portrayed as savages; having conflicts and battles against gunfighters and White settlements. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), an estimated 19,000 White men, women, and children were killed while the Indians killed numbered between 30,000 and 45,000 casualties during the American Indian Wars.[28] Gunfighters in history did fight Native Americans. Among them was civilian Billy Dixon, who made one of the longest recorded sniper kills, by shooting an Indian off his horse almost a mile away with his Sharps rifle, during a standoff in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls.[29]\\nGeneral George S. Patton himself had a gunfight when he was a young second lieutenant chasing Pancho Villa all over northern Mexico in 1916. Patton and 10 enlisted men had been sent to San Miguelito Ranch to look for Villa, who had recently raided the city of Columbus, New Mexico. Patton positioned his men by the south gate and was making his way up to the north gate when a trio of Villa\\'s men came into the ranch on horseback. Patton drew his single-action Colt Peacemaker revolver and shot two of the men. The first man had been fatally wounded in the exchange and tried to draw his pistol before Patton killed him with a single shot. After his troops took down the remaining outlaw, Patton tied the three dead men to the hood of his touring car and drove the bodies back to his commanding officer.[30]\\nThe image of two gunslingers with violent reputations squaring off in a street is a Hollywood invention.[21] However, face-to-face fast draw shootouts did occur in the real West.[9][12] These duels were first recorded in the South, brought by emigrants to the American Frontier as a crude form of the \"code duello,\" a highly formalized means of solving disputes between gentlemen with swords or guns that had its origins in European chivalry.[31] By the second half of the 19th century, few Americans still fought duels to solve their problems, and it became a thing of the past in the United States by the start of the 20th century.[32] Writer Wyatt-Brown in his book \"Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South\" described dueling in the American frontier as a \"custom\", and was primarily used for teenage disputes, rise in rank, status, and scapegoating.[33]\\nThe most famous and well-recorded duel occurred on 21 July 1865, in Springfield, Missouri.[21][25] Wild Bill Hickok and Davis Tutt quarreled over cards and decided to have a gunfight. They arranged to walk toward each other at 6 pm. Wild Bill\\'s armed presence caused the crowd to immediately scatter to the safety of nearby buildings, leaving Tutt alone in the northwestern corner of the square. When they were about 50 yards apart, both men drew their guns. The two fired at the same time, but Hickok\\'s shot hit Tutt in the heart, while Tutt\\'s shot missed. This was the first recorded example of two men taking part in a quick-draw duel. The following month Hickok was acquitted after pleading self-defense. The first story of the shootout was detailed in an article in Harper\\'s Magazine in 1867 and became a staple of the gunslinger legend.[31]\\nThe famous lawman Wyatt Earp gave an account of having participated in a duel once during his vendetta. While in the South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains, Earp\\'s posse found one of the outlaw cowboys named \"Indian Charlie\" Cruz. One account says that after the party recognized Cruz, they chased him down and a gunfight ensued.[34] The party managed to capture Cruz and he confessed to having taken part in Morgan\\'s murder, and that he identified Stilwell, Hank Swilling, Curly Bill, and Johnny Ringo as other of Morgan\\'s killers. During that time, Wyatt allowed Cruz to keep his revolver to \"give him a chance to fight like a man.\" After the confession, Wyatt told Cruz to draw, challenging him to a duel, and the posse counted to three before Wyatt gunned Cruz down.[35]\\nThe Langford–Peel shootout occurred on July 22, 1867, between gunmen John Bull and Langford Peel.[36]\\nDoc Holliday himself had a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico.[37] One of the women who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been discharged from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce\\'s hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.[citation needed]\\nAnother well-known duel in the American West happened in Fort Worth, Texas, and was known as the Luke Short-Jim Courtright Duel.[25][38] Timothy Isaiah \"Longhair Jim\" Courtright was running the T.I.C. Commercial agency in Fort Worth, which provided \"protection\" to gambling dens and saloons in return for a portion of their profits. At the same time, Luke Short, a former friend of Courtright\\'s, was running the White Elephant Saloon and Jim was trying to get Short to utilize his services. But the Dodge City gunfighter told Courtright to \"go to Hell,\" and that he could do anything that was necessary to take care of his business. On February 8, 1887, the two quarreled, and with Bat Masterson at Short\\'s side, Courtright and Short dueled in the street. They drew their pistols at close range, and Short fired first, blowing off Courtright\\'s thumb. Courtright attempted the \"border shift\", a move where a gunfighter switches his gun to his uninjured hand, but he was too slow. Short shot him in the chest, killing him.[citation needed]\\nThe Long Branch Saloon Shootout, involving Levi Richardson, a buffalo hunter, and \"Cockeyed Frank\" Loving, a professional gambler, happened on April 5, 1879.[39] Richardson had developed some affection for Loving\\'s wife Mattie, and the two began to argue about her. In the saloon, Frank sat down at a long table, Richardson turned around and took a seat at the same table. The two were then heard speaking in low voices. After the conversation, Richardson drew his pistol, and Loving drew his in response. The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke. Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett, who was in Beatty & Kelley\\'s Saloon, heard the shots and came running. Both men were still standing, although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving\\'s Remington No. 44 was empty. Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down in a chair and took his gun, while Bassett disarmed Loving. Richardson then got up and started toward the billiard table, when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest, as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm. Frank Loving, who had only a slight scratch on his hand, was immediately taken to jail. Two days later, the coroner\\'s inquest ruled that the killing had been in self-defense and Loving was immediately released.[citation needed]\\nOn March 9, 1877, gamblers Jim Levy and Charlie Harrison argued over a game of cards in a saloon in Cheyenne, Wyoming.[40] They met in an alley following an argument about a card game. Harrison shot first but missed. Levy aimed carefully and hit Harrison, who died a week later.[41]\\nNot as well known today but famous in his time was the dapper, derby-wearing train robber Marion Hedgepeth, who despite his swell appearance, \"was a deadly killer and one of the fastest guns in the Wild, Wild West\". William Pinkerton, whose National Detective Agency had sought to capture Hedgepeth and his gang for years, noted that Hedgepeth once gunned down another outlaw who had already unholstered his pistol before Hedgepath had drawn his revolver.[42] The infamous assassin Tom Horn was also said to have participated in a duel with a second lieutenant from the Mexican Army, due to a dispute with a prostitute when he was twenty-six years old.[43] Gunfighters Jim Levy and Tom Carberry became infamous for participating in at least two quick draw duels in their lifetimes.[44][45]\\nMost Old West men who were labeled as being \"gunfighters\" did not kill nearly as many men in gunfights as they were given credit for, if any at all. They were often labeled as such due to one particular instance, which developed from rumors about them having been involved in many more events than they actually were. Often their reputation was as much \"self-promotion\" as anything else; such was the case of Bat Masterson.[46] Wyatt Earp with his brothers Morgan and Virgil along with Doc Holliday killed three outlaw Cowboys in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. He has been said to have been involved in more than one hundred gunfights in his lifetime. But Prof. Bill O\\'Neal cites just five incidents in his Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters.[10] Earp expressed his dismay about the controversy that followed him his entire life. He wrote in a letter to John Hays Hammond on May 21, 1925, that \"notoriety had been the bane of my life.\"[47]\\nAfter his brother Virgil was maimed in an ambush and Morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants, the men suspected of involvement were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys and released without trial. Wyatt and his brother Warren set out on a vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible. Wyatt has been portrayed in a number of films and books as a fearless Western hero.[48] He is often viewed as the central character and hero of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, at least in part because he was the only one who was not wounded or killed. In fact, his brother, Tombstone Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal.[49] As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to disarm the Cowboys in Tombstone and requested Wyatt\\'s assistance.[50] But because Wyatt outlived Virgil and due to a creative biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal published two years after Wyatt\\'s death, Wyatt became famous and the subject of various movies, television shows, biographies and works of fiction.[citation needed]\\nThere are no records to support the reputation that Johnny Ringo developed.[51] Of the documented instances where Ringo killed men, they were unarmed, and there is no evidence to support his participation in a single gunfight. Others deserved the reputation associated with them. Jim Courtright and Dallas Stoudenmire both killed several men in gunfights both as lawmen and as civilians.[52] Clay Allison and Ben Thompson had well-deserved reputations.[53] At the same time, gunmen like Scott Cooley are all but unknown, when they actually led a life reflective of what most would consider a gunfighter to be.[54]\\nIn other cases, certain gunfighters were possibly confused, over time, with being someone else with a similar name. The most well-known of Butch Cassidy\\'s Wild Bunch gang,[55] the Sundance Kid, was in reality only known to have been in one shootout during his lifetime, and no gunfights. Some historians have since stated that it is possible that over time he was confused with another Wild Bunch member, Kid Curry, who was without a doubt the most dangerous member of the gang, having killed many lawmen and civilians during his lifetime before being killed himself. Hence, it is the Sundance Kid who is better known.[citation needed]\\nIt is often difficult to separate lawmen of the Old West from outlaws of the Old West. In many cases, the term gunfighter was applied to constables. Despite idealistic portrayals in television, movies, and even in history books, very few lawmen/gunfighters could claim their law enforcement role as their only source of employment. Unlike contemporary peace officers, these lawmen generally pursued other occupations, often earning money as gamblers, business owners, or outlaws—as was the case with \"Curly\" Bill Brocius, who, while always referred to as an outlaw, served as a deputy sheriff under sheriff Johnny Behan. Many shootouts involving lawmen were caused by disputes arising from these alternative occupations, rather than the lawman\\'s attempts to enforce the law.[56]\\nTom Horn, historically cited as an assassin, served both as a deputy sheriff and as a Pinkerton detective, a job in which he shot at least three people as a killer for hire.[57] Ben Thompson, best known as a gunfighter and gambler, was a very successful chief of police in Austin, Texas. King Fisher had great success as a county sheriff in Texas. Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid both wore badges as lawmen at least once.[58] \"Big\" Steve Long served as deputy marshal for Laramie, Wyoming, while the entire time committing murders and forced theft of land deeds. A town with a substantial violent crime rate would often turn to a known gunman as their town marshal, chief, or sheriff, in the hopes that the gunman could stem the violence and bring order.[citation needed]\\nKnown gunmen/lawmen were generally effective, and in time the violence would subside, usually, after the gunman/lawman had been involved in several shooting incidents, eventually leading to a substantial and well-earned fear that kept everyone in line.[59] At times they were hired by cattlemen or other prominent figures to serve as henchmen or enforcers during cattle wars. Although sanctioned by law enforcement officials, the gunmen were not always actually deputized. Sometimes, however, just to make things \"official\", they would go through the formality of deputization.[59] A case in point: the service of the Jesse Evans Gang, and outlaw Jesse Evans himself, as agents for the Murphy-Dolan faction during the Lincoln County War.[60] While technically working as lawmen, they were little more than hired guns.[citation needed]\\nUsually, when a gunman was hired by a town as town marshal, they received the full support of the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate it was time for a change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law.[59] A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his guns or his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying he could keep his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later.[citation needed]\\nPeople relive the Wild West both historically and in popular culture by participating in cowboy action shooting events,[61] where each gunslinger adopts his or her own look representing a character from Western life in the late 1800s, and as part of that character, chooses an alias to go by. The sport originated in Southern California, USA, in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS), as well as others in the US and in other countries. There are different categories shooters can compete in. There\\'s the gunfighter, frontiersman, classic cowboy, and duelist – each with its own specifications.[62]\\nAlongside the iconic cowboy, gunfighters have become a cultural image of the American people abroad, and also as an idealized image of violence, frontier justice, and adventure.[63][64] Even outside of the Western genre, the term \\'gunslinger\\' has been used in modern times to describe someone who is fast and accurate with pistols, either in real life or in other fictional action genres.[65][66][67]\\nThe quick draw which gunfighters help popularize, is still an important skill in the American military and law enforcement communities.[67][68]\\nGunfighters have been featured in media even outside the Western genre, often combined with other elements and genres, mainly science-fiction space Westerns, steampunk, and the contemporary setting.[7] Abilities, clothing, and attitude associated with gunfighters are seen in many other genres. An example of this is \"Han shot first\", in which Han Solo, a gunfighter-like protagonist in Star Wars, kills his opponent with a subtle, under-the-table draw.[69] He also wore his holster low on, and tied to, the thigh with a cutaway for the trigger. Roland Deschain from the fantasy series The Dark Tower is a gunfighter pitted against fantasy-themed monsters and enemies. Inspired by the \"Man with No Name\" and other spaghetti-western characters, he himself is detached or unsympathetic, often reacting as uncaring or angry at signs of cowardice or self-pity, yet he possesses a strong sense of heroism, often attempting to help those in need, a morality much seen in Westerns.[70]\\nJonah Hex, from DC Comics, is a ruthless bounty hunter bound by a personal code of honor to protect and avenge the innocent. IGN ranked Jonah Hex the 73rd greatest comic book hero of all time.[71] Throughout the DC Universe, Hex has been, on many occasions, transported from the Old West to the contemporary setting and beyond. Even in unfamiliar territory and time periods, Hex managed to outgun his enemies with more advanced weaponry. Two-Gun Kid is another comic book gunfighter from Marvel Comics. Skilled with revolvers, he has aided many superheroes in future timelines, most notably She-Hulk.[72]\\nMany Japanese manga and anime have also adopted the western genre. Yasuhiro Nightow is known for creating the space Western Trigun.[73] The story\\'s protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is a wandering gunslinger with a dark past. Unlike other violence-themed gunslingers, Vash carries a Shane-like pacifist attitude, and avoids killing men, even dangerous enemies. Behind him is the gun-toting priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who carries with him a heavy machine gun and rocket launcher shaped like a cross. Nicholas is more violent than Vash, and the two would often argue about killing opponents. Other western genre-themed manga and anime include Cowboy Bebop and Kino\\'s Journey, which both incorporate knight-errant gunslinger themes.[74][75]\\nModern-day western gunslingers have also appeared in recent Neo-Westerns.[76] Raylan Givens from the television series Justified shares the same ambiguous moral code of an Old West sheriff, even using a fast draw to dispatch his enemies. The hitman Anton Chigurh from No Country for Old Men shares many elements of a hunted outlaw.[77] Additionally, the comic book character Vigilante is a self-proclaimed gunfighter born in the 1940s.[78]\\nGunfighters have also been featured in many video games, both in traditional Old West and in contemporary and future settings. Colton White was the protagonist of 2005\\'s best-selling western video game Gun.[79] Another well-known video game Western protagonist is John Marston from Red Dead Redemption, who was nominated for 2010 Spike\\'s Video Game Awards, as well as his friend Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2.[80] The New York Times stated: \"he and his creators conjure such a convincing, cohesive and enthralling re-imagination of the real world that it sets a new standard for sophistication and ambition in electronic gaming.\"[81] The main character Caleb in the video games Blood and Blood II: The Chosen is also a former Old West gunfighter.[82] Gunfighter is also a callsign for a group of two Apache Helicopters in the video game Medal of Honor. They appear on a mission named \"Gunfighters\", and the player will act as Captain Brad \"Hawk\" Hawkins from 1st Aviation Regiment.[83]\\nFormer professional American football quarterback Brett Favre was nicknamed \"The Gunslinger\" due to his rural, Southern upbringing and his wild, risky, quick-throwing play style that led him to great success in the National Football League.[84][85]\\n\\n',\n",
       "  'Romanticised outlaws are stock characters found in a number of fictional settings.\\nThis was particularly so in the United States, where outlaws were popular subjects of newspaper coverage and stories in the 19th century, and 20th century fiction and Western films.  Thus, \"outlaw\" is still commonly used to mean those violating the law[1] or, by extension, those living that lifestyle, whether actual criminals evading the law or those merely opposed to \"law-and-order\" notions of conformity and authority (such as the \"outlaw country\" music movement in the 1970s).\\nThe colloquial sense of an outlaw as bandit or brigand is the subject of a monograph by British author Eric Hobsbawm:[2] Hobsbawm\\'s book discusses the bandit as a symbol, and mediated idea, and many of the outlaws he refers to, such as Ned Kelly, Mr. Dick Turpin, and Billy the Kid, are also listed below.\\nThe point about social bandits is that they are peasant outlaws whom the lord and state regard as criminals, but who remain within peasant society, and are considered by their people as heroes, as champions, avengers, fighters for justice, perhaps even leaders of liberation, and in any case as men to be admired, helped and supported. This relation between the ordinary peasant and the rebel, outlaw and robber is what makes social banditry interesting and significant ... Social banditry of this kind is one of the most universal social phenomena known to history.The stereotype owes a great deal to English folklore precedents, in the tales of Robin Hood and of gallant highwaymen.  But outlawry was once a term of art in the law, and one of the harshest judgments that could be pronounced on anyone\\'s head.\\nThe outlaw is familiar to contemporary readers as an archetype in Western films, depicting the lawless expansionism period of the United States in the late 19th century. The Western outlaw is typically a criminal who operates from a base in the wilderness, and opposes, attacks or disrupts the fragile institutions of new settlements.  By the time of the Western frontier, many jurisdictions had abolished the process of outlawry, and the term was used in its more popular meaning. Some Old West outlaws, such as Billy the Kid and Jesse James, became legendary figures in Western lore both in their own lifetime and long after their deaths.\\nCangaceiros\\nHajduci\\nKlephtes\\nIn Australia two gangs of bushrangers have been made outlaws – that is they were declared to have no legal rights and anybody was empowered to shoot them without the need for an arrest followed by a trial.\\n°Kayamkulam Kochunni a heroic outlaw from Kayamkulam who lived during the late 19th century.

       "  'Fast draw, also known as quick draw, is the ability to quickly draw a handgun and accurately fire it upon a target in the process. This skill was made popular by romanticized depictions of gunslingers in the Western genre, which in turn were inspired by famous historical gunfights in the American Old West.\\nIn modern times, fast draw can be seen both in sports and in military practices. The World Fast Draw Association (WFDA) is the international sanctioning body of the sport of fast draw. Unlike cowboy action shooting, fast draw is shot with special blanks or wax bullets. While some competitions are strictly against the clock, with the fastest time winning, many are set up as head-to-head single- or double-elimination matches.\\nThe object of fast draw as a combative sport is to quickly draw one\\'s pistol and fire with the most accuracy. The sport has been inspired by accounts of duels and gunfights which incorporated it during the Wild West, such as the Hickok–Tutt shootout, Short–Courtright duel, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Long Branch Saloon gunfight and others, which in turn inspired the gunfights seen in Hollywood western movies.[1][2] Gunfighters Jim Leavy and Tom Carberry became infamous for participating in at least two quick draw duels in their lifetimes.[3][4] In the case of Jonathan R. Davis, the quick draw is also necessary for a gunman to fight back if he is ambushed. Though many gunfighters were remembered to be dangerous with a pistol during the American frontier, only a few known historical individuals have been noted by historians as \"fast\", such as Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, John Wesley Hardin, Luke Short, Tom Horn and Billy the Kid.[5][6]\\nAlthough unlike the depiction seen in westerns, fast draw duels at that time were performed with the traditional dueling stance. Typically, historical Western duels were a crude form of the Southern duel, which followed a formal code, a highly formalized means of solving disputes between gentlemen with swords or guns that had its origins in European chivalry.[7] During the Old West, the term \"fast on the draw\" or \"quick on the draw\" did not necessarily mean a person is swift on drawing a pistol, it actually meant that a person is aggressive and would draw his weapon at even the slightest provocation.[8]\\nWhile the ability to draw a firearm quickly was a popular skill during the American frontier, modern fast draw is inspired more by gun duels in western films than historical gunfights. Most gunfights that occurred in the Old West were more spontaneous due to either alcohol consumption or heated squabbles.[1][6][9] Duels, while also fought to uphold honor, were usually not formalized and sometimes were due to the heat of the moment. In these circumstances, the one who can draw, fire and hit his opponent first was usually the winner, but accuracy and calmness were also, and sometimes more, favored by actual gunmen in the era.\\nIn western movies, the characters\\' gun belts are often worn low on the hip and outer thigh, with the holster cut away around the pistol\\'s trigger and grip for a smooth, fast draw. This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism.[5] Fast-draw artists can be distinguished from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets, which was faster and more practical.[6] Other gunfighters would use Bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw.[10]\\nFast draw is one of the fastest sports in the world. Every time is measured under one second, from the signal to draw to when the timer is stopped.  The current World Fast Draw Association (WFDA) record for Open Class Fast Draw in an event called Standing Balloons is .208 seconds - and that includes the time it takes to react, draw, fire and pop a balloon target at eight feet away. A world class competitor can draw and fire a shot in under half a second. Given that the average human reaction time is around 0.2 to 0.25 seconds, the round is over before most people can react.  The reaction times of the best fast draw shooters is 0.145 seconds, which means that the gun is cocked, drawn, aimed (from the hip), and fired in just over 0.06 seconds.  To establish a World Fast Draw Association record, a second shot must be fired in the same competition that is no more than 0.30 seconds slower than the first; this is intended to prevent a shot that anticipates the start signal from setting a record.  In competitions where two rounds must be fired, at separate targets, less than 0.10 seconds separate the shots.\\nIn Open Class, or \"traditional\" fast draw competition, shooters must start with the gun holstered, and their hands not touching the gun, as opposed to the newer sport of Cowboy Fast Draw, where the competitors start with their hand on the gun.  A signal, usually both audible and visible, signals the shooter to fire.  A timer is started when the signal is given.  The shooter fires at either a metal plate (for wax bullets) or a balloon (for blanks).  The timer is rigged to stop on the sound of the wax bullet hitting the plate, or the balloon popping.  Different types of matches use one or more targets, and the shooter can fire from a standing position, or while walking towards or backing away from the target(s).\\nThe exhibition shooter Bob Munden, proclaimed by the Guinness Book of World Records as “the fastest man with a gun who ever lived\", could draw, fire, break a balloon target with a blank using a standard weight single-action revolver and return his gun to his holster faster than the blink of an eye. Munden was recorded shooting .16 of a second, in an event called Walk and Draw Level.\\nFast draw and quick draw can also be seen in real-life combat situations. It is an important skill that is still being taught and crafted in the military and the police. Draw speed is essential in a deadly force situation and soldiers are trained to be able to draw their sidearm and fire with speed and accuracy.[11]\\nIn June 2011, a soldier named Sgt. Brent McBride played a game of quick draw with his fellow soldier and roommate, Sgt. Matthew Gallagher. The incident happened in their small trailer-like room in Al Kut, Iraq. During the game, McBride drew his pistol and shot Gallagher in the head at close range. McBride pleaded guilty at Fort Hood, Texas, court martial in March 2012 to involuntary manslaughter.[12]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nA Western saloon is a kind of bar particular to the Old West. Saloons served customers such as fur trappers, cowboys, soldiers, lumberjacks, businessmen, lawmen, outlaws, miners, and gamblers. A saloon might also be known as a \"watering trough, bughouse, shebang, cantina, grogshop, and gin mill\". The first saloon was established at Brown\\'s Hole, Wyoming, in 1822, to serve fur trappers.[citation needed]\\nBy 1880, the growth of saloons was in full swing. In Leavenworth, Kansas, there were \"about 150 saloons and four wholesale liquor houses\".[1] Some saloons in the Old West were little more than casinos, brothels, and opium dens.\\nThe word saloon originated as an alternative form of the French word salon; it first appeared in 17th century France and was derived from the Italian salone (for a large reception hall of Italian mansions). A European salon became associated with a \\'large hall in a public place for entertainment, etc.\\'\" In the United States, the word had evolved into \"saloon\" with its present meaning by 1841.[2]\\nSaloons in the U.S. began to have a close association with breweries in the early 1880s. With a growing overcapacity, breweries began to adopt the British \"tied-house\" system of control where they owned saloons outright. Schlitz Brewing Company and a few others built elaborate saloons to attract customers and advertise their beers.[3]\\nPoliticians also frequented local saloons because of the adaptable social nature of their business.\\nBeginning in 1893, the Anti-Saloon League began protesting against American saloons. In 1895 it became a national organization and quickly rose to become the most powerful prohibition lobby in America, pushing aside its older competitors the Woman\\'s Christian Temperance Union and the Prohibition Party. The League lobbied at all levels of government for legislation to prohibit the manufacture or import of spirits, beer and wine. Ministers had launched several efforts to close Arizona saloons after the 1906 creation of League chapters in Yuma, Tucson, and Phoenix. League members pressured local police to take licenses from establishments that violated closing hours or served women and minors, and they provided witnesses to testify about these violations. Its triumph was nationwide prohibition locked into the Constitution with passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920. It was decisively defeated when prohibition was repealed in 1933.\\nThe free lunch was a sales enticement which offered a meal at no cost in order to attract customers and increase revenues from other offerings. It was a tradition once common in saloons in many places in the United States, with the phrase appearing in U.S. literature from about 1870 to the 1920s. These establishments included a \"free\" lunch, varying from rudimentary to quite elaborate, with the purchase of at least one drink. These free lunches were typically worth far more than the price of a single drink.[4] The saloon-keeper relied on the expectation that most customers would buy more than one drink, and that the practice would build patronage for other times of day.\\nA saloon\\'s appearance varied from when and where it grew. As towns grew, the saloons became more refined. The bartender prided himself on his appearance and his drink pouring abilities. Early saloons and those in remote locations were often crude affairs with minimal furniture and few decorations. Often a single wood-burning stove might warm such establishments during the winter months.\\nA pair of \"batwing\" doors at the entrance was one of the more distinctive features of the typical saloon. The doors operated on double action hinges and extended from chest to knee level.[5] Further in the American West, some sold liquor from wagons, and saloons were often formed of materials at hand, including \"sod houses. ...a hull of an old sailing ship\" or interiors \"dug into the side of a hill\". As the size of towns grew, many hotels included saloons, and some stand-alone saloons, such as the Barlow Trail Saloon in Damascus, Oregon, featured a railed porch.[citation needed]\\nSaloons\\' appearance varied by ethnic group. The Irish preferred stand-up bars where whiskey was the drink of choice and women could obtain service only through the back door. German saloons were more brightly illuminated, more likely to serve restaurant food and beer at tables, and more oriented toward family patronage. Germans were often at odds with Temperance forces over Sunday operation and over the operation of beer gardens in outlying neighborhoods. Other ethnic groups added their own features and their unique cuisines on the sideboard, while a few groups, including Scandinavians, Jews, Greeks, and Italians, either preferred intimate social clubs or did little drinking in public.[3]\\nBy way of entertainment saloons offered dancing girls, some (or most) of whom occasionally or routinely doubled as prostitutes. Many saloons offered games of chance like Faro, poker, brag, three-card monte, and dice games. Other games were added as saloons continued to prosper and face increasing competition. These additional games included billiards, darts, and bowling. Some saloons even included piano players, can-can girls, and theatrical skits.  A current example of this type of entertainment is the Long Branch Variety Show that is presented in the recreated Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas.\\nWhen a town was first founded, the initial saloons were often nothing more than tents or shacks that served homemade whiskey that included such ingredients as \"raw alcohol, burnt sugar and chewing tobacco\".\\nAs towns grew, saloons were often elaborately decorated, featured Bohemian stemware, and oil paintings were hung from the wall. The hard liquor was improved, often featuring whiskey imported from the Eastern United States and Europe. To avoid rotgut, patrons would request \"fancy\" mixed drinks. Some of the top ten drinks in 1881 included claret sangarees and champagne flips.\\nBeer was often served at room temperature since refrigeration was mostly unavailable. Adolphus Busch introduced refrigeration and pasteurization of beer in 1880 with his Budweiser brand. Some saloons kept the beer in kegs stored on racks inside the saloon. Some saloons made their own beer. Sometimes the beer was also kept in chairs, as seen in the motion picture Fort Apache (1948).[citation needed]\\nAmong the more familiar saloons were First Chance Saloon in Miles City, Montana; the Bull\\'s Head in Abilene, Kansas; the Arcade Saloon in Eldora, Colorado; the Holy Moses in Creede, Colorado; the Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas; the Birdcage Theater in Tombstone, Arizona; the Bucket of Blood Saloon in Virginia City, Nevada; and the Jersey Lilly in Langtry, Texas. Many of these establishments remained open twenty-four hours a day, six days a week except Sundays and Christmas.[citation needed]\\nIn the American West, occasional incidents were connected to saloons. Phil Coe, the owner of the Bull\\'s Head tavern in Abilene, Kansas, outraged the townspeople by painting a bull, complete with an erect penis (pizzle), on the outside wall of his tavern. The marshal at the time, Wild Bill Hickok,  threatened to burn the saloon to the ground if the offending animal was not painted over. Instead, he hired some men to do the job, which angered Coe. The two became enemies and in a later altercation, Wild Bill Hickok killed Coe.[6]\\nWild Bill, also a professional lawman, gunfighter, and gambler, was later killed on August 2, 1876, by Jack McCall, who shot him in the back of the head, in Saloon No. 10, in Deadwood, South Dakota, as Wild Bill was playing cards. His hand—aces and eights, according to tradition—has become known as the \"dead man\\'s hand\".\\nFormer lawman, faro dealer, and gambler Wyatt Earp worked in or owned several saloons during his lifetime, outright or in partnership with others. He and two of his brothers arrived in Tombstone, Arizona, on December 1, 1879, and during January 1881, Oriental Saloon owner Lou Rickabaugh gave Wyatt Earp a one-quarter interest in the faro concession at the Oriental Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer.[7]:\\u200a41\\u200a Wyatt invited his friend, lawman and gambler Bat Masterson, to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in the Oriental Saloon. In 1884, after leaving Tombstone, Wyatt and his wife Josie, Warren, James and Bessie Earp went to Eagle City, Idaho, another boom town.[8] Wyatt was looking for gold in the Murray-Eagle mining district. They opened a saloon called The White Elephant in a circus tent.  An advertisement in a local newspaper suggested gentlemen \"come and see the elephant\".[9]\\nIn 1885, Earp and Josie moved to San Diego where the railroad was about to arrive and a real estate boom was underway. They stayed for about four years. Earp speculated in San Diego\\'s booming real estate market.[10] Between 1887 and around 1896 he bought three saloons and gambling halls, one on Fourth Street and the other two near Sixth and E, all in the \"respectable\" part of town.[10][11][12] They offered twenty-one games including faro, blackjack, poker, keno, and other Victorian games of chance like pedro and monte.[10]  At the height of the boom, he made up to $1,000 a night in profit.[13] Wyatt particularly favored and may have run the Oyster Bar located in the Louis Bank of Commerce on Fifth Avenue.[7]:\\u200a71\\u200a\\nIn the fall of 1897, Earp and Josie joined in the Alaska Gold Rush and headed for Nome, Alaska. He operated a canteen during the summer of 1899 and in September, Earp and partner Charles Ellsworth Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon in Nome, Alaska, the city\\'s first two-story wooden building and its  largest and most luxurious saloon. The building was used for a variety of purposes because it was so large: 70 by 30 feet (21.3\\xa0m ×\\xa09.1\\xa0m) with 12 feet (3.7\\xa0m) ceilings.[14]\\nWyatt and Josie returned to California in 1901 with an estimated $80,000. In February 1902, they arrived in Tonopah, Nevada, where gold had been discovered and a boom was under way.  He opened the Northern Saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, and served as a deputy U.S. Marshal under Marshal J.F. Emmitt.[15]  His saloon, gambling and mining interests were profitable for a period.[16]\\n',\n",
       "  'This is an accepted version of this page\\n\"Manifest destiny\" was a phrase that represented the belief in the 19th-century United States that American settlers were destined to expand westward across North America, and that this belief was both obvious (\"manifest\") and certain (\"destiny\"). The belief was rooted in American exceptionalism and Romantic nationalism, implying the inevitable spread of the Republican form of governance.[2] It was one of the earliest expressions of American imperialism in the United States of America.[3][4][5]\\nAccording to historian William Earl Weeks, there were three basic tenets behind the concept:[2]\\nManifest destiny remained heavily divisive in politics, causing constant conflict with regards to slavery in these new states and territories.[6] It is also associated with the settler-colonial displacement of Indigenous Americans[7] and the annexation of lands to the west of the United States borders at the time on the continent. The concept became one of several major campaign issues during the 1844 presidential election, where the Democratic Party won and the phrase \"Manifest Destiny\" was coined within a year.[3][8] The concept was used by Democrats to justify the 1846 Oregon boundary dispute and the 1845 annexation of Texas as a slave state, culminating in the 1846 Mexican–American War. In contrast, the large majority of Whigs and prominent Republicans (such as Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant) rejected the concept and campaigned against these actions.[9][10][11] By 1843, former U.S. President John Quincy Adams, originally a major supporter of the concept underlying manifest destiny, had changed his mind and repudiated expansionism because it meant the expansion of slavery in Texas.[3] Ulysses S. Grant served in and condemned the Mexican–American War, declaring it \"one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation\".[10]  Historian Daniel Walker Howe summarizes that \"American imperialism did not represent an American consensus; it provoked bitter dissent within the national polity\".[3][12]\\nThere was never a set of principles defining manifest destiny; it was always a general idea rather than a specific policy made with a motto. Ill-defined but keenly felt, manifest destiny was an expression of conviction in the morality and value of expansionism that complemented other popular ideas of the era, including American exceptionalism and Romantic nationalism. Andrew Jackson, who spoke of \"extending the area of freedom\", typified the conflation of America\\'s potential greatness, the nation\\'s budding sense of Romantic self-identity, and its expansion.[13][14]\\nYet Jackson was not the only president to elaborate on the principles underlying manifest destiny. Owing in part to the lack of a definitive narrative outlining its rationale, proponents offered divergent or seemingly conflicting viewpoints. While many writers focused primarily upon American expansionism, be it into Mexico or across the Pacific, others saw the term as a call to example. Without an agreed-upon interpretation, much less an elaborated political philosophy, these conflicting views of America\\'s destiny were never resolved. This variety of possible meanings was summed up by Ernest Lee Tuveson: \"A vast complex of ideas, policies, and actions is comprehended under the phrase \\'Manifest Destiny\\'. They are not, as we should expect, all compatible, nor do they come from any one source.\"[15]\\nMost historians credit the conservative newspaper editor and future propagandist for the Confederacy, John O\\'Sullivan with coining the term manifest destiny in 1845.[8] However, other historians suggest the unsigned editorial titled \"Annexation\" in which it first appeared was written by journalist and annexation advocate Jane Cazneau.[16][17]\\nO\\'Sullivan was an influential advocate for Jacksonian democracy, described by Julian Hawthorne as \"always full of grand and world-embracing schemes\".[18] O\\'Sullivan wrote an article in 1839 that, while not using the term \"manifest destiny\", did predict a \"divine destiny\" for the United States based upon values such as equality, rights of conscience, and personal enfranchisement \"to establish on earth the moral dignity and salvation of man\".[19] This destiny was not explicitly territorial, but O\\'Sullivan predicted that the United States would be one of a \"Union of many Republics\" sharing those values.[20]\\nSix years later, in 1845, O\\'Sullivan wrote another essay titled \"Annexation\" in the Democratic Review,[21] in which he first used the phrase manifest destiny.[22] In this article he urged the U.S. to annex the Republic of Texas,[23] not only because Texas desired this, but because it was \"our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions\".[24] Overcoming Whig opposition, Democrats annexed Texas in 1845. O\\'Sullivan\\'s first usage of the phrase \"manifest destiny\" attracted little attention.[25]\\nO\\'Sullivan\\'s second use of the phrase became extremely influential. On December 27, 1845, in his newspaper the New York Morning News, O\\'Sullivan addressed the ongoing boundary dispute with Britain. O\\'Sullivan argued that the United States had the right to claim \"the whole of Oregon\":\\nAnd that claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us.[26]That is, O\\'Sullivan believed that Providence had given the United States a mission to spread republican democracy (\"the great experiment of liberty\"). Because the British government would not spread democracy, thought O\\'Sullivan, British claims to the territory should be overruled. O\\'Sullivan believed that manifest destiny was a moral ideal (a \"higher law\") that superseded other considerations.[27]\\nO\\'Sullivan\\'s original conception of manifest destiny was not a call for territorial expansion by force. He believed that the expansion of the United States would happen without the direction of the U.S. government or the involvement of the military. After Americans immigrated to new regions, they would set up new democratic governments, and then seek admission to the United States, as Texas had done. In 1845, O\\'Sullivan predicted that California would follow this pattern next, and that even Canada would eventually request annexation as well. He was critical of the Mexican–American War in 1846, although he came to believe that the outcome would be beneficial to both countries.[28]\\nIronically, O\\'Sullivan\\'s term became popular only after it was criticized by Whig opponents of the Polk administration. Whigs denounced manifest destiny, arguing, \"that the designers and supporters of schemes of conquest, to be carried on by this government, are engaged in treason to our Constitution and Declaration of Rights, giving aid and comfort to the enemies of republicanism, in that they are advocating and preaching the doctrine of the right of conquest\".[29] On January 3, 1846, Representative Robert Winthrop ridiculed the concept in Congress, saying \"I suppose the right of a manifest destiny to spread will not be admitted to exist in any nation except the universal Yankee nation.\"[30] Winthrop was the first in a long line of critics who suggested that advocates of manifest destiny were citing \"Divine Providence\" for justification of actions that were motivated by chauvinism and self-interest. Despite this criticism, expansionists embraced the phrase, which caught on so quickly that its origin was soon forgotten.[31]\\nThe concept and the term are also used by scholars in discussing the push to into the Amazon—the west—in Brazil.  According to J. P. Dickenson, \"There is an implicit identification in this Brazilian geopolitical writing of a manifest destiny....Brazil\\'s \\'Marcha para oeste\\' is as legitimate as America\\'s Manifest Destiny.\"[32][33]\\nHistorian Frederick Merk wrote in 1963 that the concept of manifest destiny was born out of \"a sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven\". Merk also states that manifest destiny was a heavily contested concept within the nation:\\nFrom the outset Manifest Destiny—vast in program, in its sense of continentalism—was slight in support. It lacked national, sectional, or party following commensurate with its magnitude. The reason was it did not reflect the national spirit. The thesis that it embodied nationalism, found in much historical writing, is backed by little real supporting evidence.[3]\\nA possible influence is racial predominance, namely the idea that the American Anglo-Saxon race was \"separate, innately superior\" and \"destined to bring good government, commercial prosperity and Christianity to the American continents and the world\". Author Reginald Horsman wrote in 1981, this view also held that \"inferior races were doomed to subordinate status or extinction.\" and that this was used to justify \"the enslavement of the blacks and the expulsion and possible extermination of the Indians\".[34]\\nThe origin of the first theme, later known as American exceptionalism, was often traced to America\\'s Puritan heritage, particularly John Winthrop\\'s famous \"City upon a Hill\" sermon of 1630, in which he called for the establishment of a virtuous community that would be a shining example to the Old World.[35] In his influential 1776 pamphlet Common Sense, Thomas Paine echoed this notion, arguing that the American Revolution provided an opportunity to create a new, better society:\\nWe have it in our power to begin the world over again. A situation, similar to the present, hath not happened since the days of Noah until now. The birthday of a new world is at hand...Many Americans agreed with Paine, and came to believe that the United States\\' virtue was a result of its special experiment in freedom and democracy. Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to James Monroe, wrote, \"it is impossible not to look forward to distant times when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern, if not the southern continent.\"[36] To Americans in the decades that followed their proclaimed freedom for mankind, embodied in the Declaration of Independence, could only be described as the inauguration of \"a new time scale\" because the world would look back and define history as events that took place before, and after, the Declaration of Independence. It followed that Americans owed to the world an obligation to expand and preserve these beliefs.[37]\\nThe second theme\\'s origination is less precise. A popular expression of America\\'s mission was elaborated by President Abraham Lincoln\\'s description in his December 1, 1862, message to Congress. He described the United States as \"the last, best hope of Earth\". The \"mission\" of the United States was further elaborated during Lincoln\\'s Gettysburg Address, in which he interpreted the American Civil War as a struggle to determine if any nation with democratic ideals could survive; this has been called by historian Robert Johannsen \"the most enduring statement of America\\'s Manifest Destiny and mission\".[38]\\nThe third theme can be viewed as a natural outgrowth of the belief that God had a direct influence in the foundation and further actions of the United States. Political scientist and historian Clinton Rossiter described this view as summing \"that God, at the proper stage in the march of history, called forth certain hardy souls from the old and privilege-ridden nations ... and that in bestowing his grace He also bestowed a peculiar responsibility\". Americans presupposed that they were not only divinely elected to maintain the North American continent, but also to \"spread abroad the fundamental principles stated in the Bill of Rights\".[39] In many cases this meant neighboring colonial holdings and countries were seen as obstacles rather than the destiny God had provided the United States.\\nFaragher\\'s 1997 analysis of the political polarization between the Democratic Party and the Whig Party is that:\\nMost Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the North) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by industrialization but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country\\'s existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue, the extension of slavery to the territories. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed... For many Democrats, the answer to the nation\\'s social ills was to continue to follow Thomas Jefferson\\'s vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories to counterbalance industrialization.[6]Two Native American writers have recently tried to link some of the themes of manifest destiny to the original ideology of the 15th-century decree of the Doctrine of Christian Discovery.[40] Nick Estes (a Lakota) links the 15th-century Catholic doctrine of distinguishing Christians from non-Christians in the expansion of European nations.[40] Estes and international jurist Tonya Gonnella Frichner (of the Onondaga Nation) further link the doctrine of discovery to Johnson v. McIntosh and frame their arguments on the correlation between manifest destiny and Doctrine of Christian Discovery by using the statement made by Chief Justice John Marshall during the case, as he \"spelled out the rights of the United states to Indigenous lands\" and drew upon the Doctrine of Christian Discovery for his statement.[40][41] Marshall ruled that \"indigenous peoples possess \\'occupancy\\' rights, meaning their lands could be taken by the powers of \\'discovery\\'\".[41] Frichner explains that \"The newly formed United States needed to manufacture an American Indian political identity and concept of Indian land that would open the way for united states and westward colonial expansion.\"[41] In this way, manifest destiny was inspired by the original European colonization of the Americas, and it excuses U.S. violence against Indigenous Nations.[40]\\nAccording to historian Dorceta Taylor: \"Minorities are not usually chronicled as explorers or environmental activists, yet the historical records show that they were a part of expeditions, resided and worked on the frontier, founded towns, and were educators and entrepreneurs. In short, people of color were very important actors in westward expansion.\"[42]\\nThe desire for trade with China and other Asian countries was another ground for expansionism, with Americans seeing prospects of westward contact with Asia as fulfilling long-held Western hopes of finding new routes to Asia, and perceiving the Pacific as less unruly and dominated by Old World conflicts than the Atlantic and therefore a more inviting area for the new nation to expand its influence in.[43]\\nWith the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, which doubled the size of the United States, Thomas Jefferson set the stage for the continental expansion of the United States. Many began to see this as the beginning of a new providential mission: If the United States was successful as a \"shining city upon a hill\", people in other countries would seek to establish their own democratic republics.[44]\\nNot all Americans or their political leaders believed that the United States was a divinely favored nation, or thought that it ought to expand. For example, many Whigs opposed territorial expansion based on the Democratic claim that the United States was destined to serve as a virtuous example to the rest of the world, and also had a divine obligation to spread its superordinate political system and a way of life throughout North American continent. Many in the Whig party \"were fearful of spreading out too widely\", and they \"adhered to the concentration of national authority in a limited area\".[45] In July 1848, Alexander Stephens denounced President Polk\\'s expansionist interpretation of America\\'s future as \"mendacious\".[46]\\nUlysses S. Grant served in the war with Mexico and later wrote:\\nI was bitterly opposed to the measure [to annex Texas], and to this day regard the war [with Mexico] which resulted as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.[47]In the mid‑19th century, expansionism, especially southward toward Cuba, also faced opposition from those Americans who were trying to abolish slavery. As more territory was added to the United States in the following decades, \"extending the area of freedom\" in the minds of southerners also meant extending the institution of slavery. That is why slavery became one of the central issues in the continental expansion of the United States before the Civil War.[48]\\nBefore and during the Civil War both sides claimed that America\\'s destiny was rightfully their own. Lincoln opposed anti-immigrant nativism, and the imperialism of manifest destiny as both unjust and unreasonable.[49] He objected to the Mexican war and believed each of these disordered forms of patriotism threatened the inseparable moral and fraternal bonds of liberty and union that he sought to perpetuate through a patriotic love of country guided by wisdom and critical self-awareness. Lincoln\\'s \"Eulogy to Henry Clay\", June 6, 1852, provides the most cogent expression of his reflective patriotism.[50]\\nThe phrase \"manifest destiny\" is most often associated with the territorial expansion of the United States from 1812 to 1867. This era, from the War of 1812 to the acquisition of Alaska in 1867, has been called the \"age of manifest destiny\".[51] During this time, the United States expanded to the Pacific Ocean—\"from sea to shining sea\"—largely defining the borders of the continental United States as they are today.[52]\\nOne of the goals of the War of 1812 was to threaten to annex the British colony of Lower Canada as a bargaining chip to force the British to abandon their fortifications in the Northwestern United States and support for the various Native American tribes residing there.[53][54] The result of this overoptimism was a series of defeats in 1812 in part due to the wide use of poorly-trained state militias rather than regular troops. The American victories at the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames in 1813 ended the Indian raids and removed the main reason for threatening annexation. To end the War of 1812 John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay and Albert Gallatin (former treasury secretary and a leading expert on Indians) and the other American diplomats negotiated the Treaty of Ghent in 1814 with Britain. They rejected the British plan to set up an Indian state in U.S. territory south of the Great Lakes. They explained the American policy toward acquisition of Indian lands:\\nThe United States, while intending never to acquire lands from the Indians otherwise than peaceably, and with their free consent, are fully determined, in that manner, progressively, and in proportion as their growing population may require, to reclaim from the state of nature, and to bring into cultivation every portion of the territory contained within their acknowledged boundaries. In thus providing for the support of millions of civilized beings, they will not violate any dictate of justice or of humanity; for they will not only give to the few thousand savages scattered over that territory an ample equivalent for any right they may surrender, but will always leave them the possession of lands more than they can cultivate, and more than adequate to their subsistence, comfort, and enjoyment, by cultivation. If this be a spirit of aggrandizement, the undersigned are prepared to admit, in that sense, its existence; but they must deny that it affords the slightest proof of an intention not to respect the boundaries between them and European nations, or of a desire to encroach upon the territories of Great Britain... They will not suppose that that Government will avow, as the basis of their policy towards the United States a system of arresting their natural growth within their own territories, for the sake of preserving a perpetual desert for savages.[55]A shocked Henry Goulburn, one of the British negotiators at Ghent, remarked, after coming to understand the American position on taking the Indians\\' land:\\nTill I came here, I had no idea of the fixed determination which there is in the heart of every American to extirpate the Indians and appropriate their territory.[56]The 19th-century belief that the United States would eventually encompass all of North America is known as \"continentalism\".[57][58] An early proponent of this idea, John Quincy Adams became a leading figure in U.S. expansion between the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Polk administration in the 1840s. In 1811, Adams wrote to his father:\\nThe whole continent of North America appears to be destined by Divine Providence to be peopled by one nation, speaking one language, professing one general system of religious and political principles, and accustomed to one general tenor of social usages and customs. For the common happiness of them all, for their peace and prosperity, I believe it is indispensable that they should be associated in one federal Union.[59]Adams did much to further this idea. He orchestrated the Treaty of 1818, which established the border between British North America and the United States as far west as the Rocky Mountains, and provided for the joint occupation of the region known in American history as the Oregon Country and in British and Canadian history as the New Caledonia and Columbia Districts. He negotiated the Transcontinental Treaty in 1819, transferring Florida from Spain to the United States and extending the U.S. border with Spanish Mexico all the way to the Pacific Ocean. And he formulated the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which warned Europe that the Western Hemisphere was no longer open for European colonization.\\nThe Monroe Doctrine and \"manifest destiny\" formed a closely related nexus of principles: historian Walter McDougall calls manifest destiny a corollary of the Monroe Doctrine, because while the Monroe Doctrine did not specify expansion, expansion was necessary in order to enforce the doctrine. Concerns in the United States that European powers were seeking to acquire colonies or greater influence in North America led to calls for expansion in order to prevent this. In his influential 1935 study of manifest destiny, done in conjunction with the Walter Hines Page School of International Relations,[60] Albert Weinberg wrote: \"the expansionism of the [1830s] arose as a defensive effort to forestall the encroachment of Europe in North America\".[61]\\nManifest destiny played an important role in the development of the transcontinental railroad.[when?] The transcontinental railroad system is often used in manifest destiny imagery like John Gast\\'s painting, American Progress where multiple locomotives are seen traveling west.[1] According to academic Dina Gilio-Whitaker, \"the transcontinental railroads not only enabled [U.S. control over the continent] but also accelerated it exponentially.\"[62] Historian Boyd Cothran says that \"modern transportation development and abundant resource exploitation gave rise to an appropriation of indigenous land, [and] resources.\"[63]\\nManifest destiny played its most important role in the Oregon boundary dispute between the United States and Britain, when the phrase \"manifest destiny\" originated. The Anglo-American Convention of 1818 had provided for the joint occupation of the Oregon Country, and thousands of Americans migrated there in the 1840s over the Oregon Trail. The British rejected a proposal by U.S. President John Tyler (in office 1841–1845) to divide the region along the 49th parallel, and instead proposed a boundary line farther south, along the Columbia River, which would have made most of what later became the state of Washington part of their colonies in North America. Advocates of manifest destiny protested and called for the annexation of the entire Oregon Country up to the Alaska line (54°40ʹ N). Presidential candidate Polk used this popular outcry to his advantage, and the Democrats called for the annexation of \"All Oregon\" in the 1844 U.S. presidential election.\\nAs president, Polk sought compromise and renewed the earlier offer to divide the territory in half along the 49th parallel, to the dismay of the most ardent advocates of manifest destiny. When the British refused the offer, American expansionists responded with slogans such as \"The whole of Oregon or none\" and \"Fifty-four forty or fight\", referring to the northern border of the region. (The latter slogan is often mistakenly described as having been a part of the 1844 presidential campaign.)[64] When Polk moved to terminate the joint occupation agreement, the British finally agreed in early 1846 to divide the region along the 49th parallel, leaving the lower Columbia basin as part of the United States. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 formally settled the dispute; Polk\\'s administration succeeded in selling the treaty to Congress because the United States was about to begin the Mexican–American War, and the president and others argued it would be foolish to also fight the British Empire.[citation needed]\\nDespite the earlier clamor for \"All Oregon\", the Oregon Treaty was popular in the United States and was easily ratified by the Senate. The most fervent advocates of manifest destiny had not prevailed along the northern border because, according to Reginald Stuart, \"the compass of manifest destiny pointed west and southwest, not north, despite the use of the term \\'continentalism\\'\".[65]\\nIn 1869, American historian Frances Fuller Victor published Manifest Destiny in the West in the Overland Monthly, arguing that the efforts of early American fur traders and missionaries presaged American control of Oregon. She concluded the article as follows:\\nIt was an oversight on the part of the United States, the giving up the island of Quadra and Vancouver, on the settlement of the boundary question. Yet, \"what is to be, will be\", as some realist has it; and we look for the restoration of that picturesque and rocky atom of our former territory as inevitable.[66]Manifest destiny played an important role in the expansion of Texas and American relationship with Mexico.[67] In 1836, the Republic of Texas declared independence from Mexico and, after the Texas Revolution, sought to join the United States as a new state. This was an idealized process of expansion that had been advocated from Jefferson to O\\'Sullivan: newly democratic and independent states would request entry into the United States, rather than the United States extending its government over people who did not want it. The annexation of Texas was attacked by anti-slavery spokesmen because it would add another slave state to the Union. Presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren declined Texas\\'s offer to join the United States in part because the slavery issue threatened to divide the Democratic Party.[68]\\nBefore the election of 1844, Whig candidate Henry Clay and the presumed Democratic candidate, former president, Van Buren, both declared themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas, each hoping to keep the troublesome topic from becoming a campaign issue. This unexpectedly led to Van Buren being dropped by the Democrats in favor of Polk, who favored annexation. Polk tied the Texas annexation question with the Oregon dispute, thus providing a sort of regional compromise on expansion. (Expansionists in the North were more inclined to promote the occupation of Oregon, while Southern expansionists focused primarily on the annexation of Texas.) Although elected by a very slim margin, Polk proceeded as if his victory had been a mandate for expansion.[69]\\nAfter the election of Polk, but before he took office, Congress approved the annexation of Texas. Polk moved to occupy a portion of Texas that had declared independence from Mexico in 1836, but was still claimed by Mexico. This paved the way for the outbreak of the Mexican–American War on April 24, 1846. With American successes on the battlefield, by the summer of 1847 there were calls for the annexation of \"All Mexico\", particularly among Eastern Democrats, who argued that bringing Mexico into the Union was the best way to ensure future peace in the region.[70]\\nThis was a controversial proposition for two reasons. First, idealistic advocates of manifest destiny like O\\'Sullivan had always maintained that the laws of the United States should not be imposed on people against their will. The annexation of \"All Mexico\" would be a violation of this principle. And secondly, the annexation of Mexico was controversial because it would mean extending U.S. citizenship to millions of Mexicans, who were of dark skin and majority Catholic. Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who had approved of the annexation of Texas, was opposed to the annexation of Mexico, as well as the \"mission\" aspect of manifest destiny, for racial reasons.[71] He made these views clear in a speech to Congress on January 4, 1848:\\nWe have never dreamt of incorporating into our Union any but the Caucasian race—the free white race. To incorporate Mexico, would be the very first instance of the kind, of incorporating an Indian race; for more than half of the Mexicans are Indians, and the other is composed chiefly of mixed tribes. I protest against such a union as that! Ours, sir, is the Government of a white race.... We are anxious to force free government on all; and I see that it has been urged ... that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over all the world, and especially over this continent. It is a great mistake.[72][73]This debate brought to the forefront one of the contradictions of manifest destiny: on the one hand, while identitarian ideas inherent in manifest destiny suggested that Mexicans, as non-whites, would present a threat to white racial integrity and thus were not qualified to become Americans, the \"mission\" component of manifest destiny suggested that Mexicans would be improved (or \"regenerated\", as it was then described) by bringing them into American democracy. Identitarianism was used to promote manifest destiny, but, as in the case of Calhoun and the resistance to the \"All Mexico\" movement, identitarianism was also used to oppose manifest destiny.[74] Conversely, proponents of annexation of \"All Mexico\" regarded it as an anti-slavery measure.[75]\\nThe controversy was eventually ended by the Mexican Cession, which added the territories of Alta California and Nuevo México to the United States, both more sparsely populated than the rest of Mexico. Like the \"All Oregon\" movement, the \"All Mexico\" movement quickly abated.\\nHistorian Frederick Merk, in Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation (1963), argued that the failure of the \"All Oregon\" and \"All Mexico\" movements indicates that manifest destiny had not been as popular as historians have traditionally portrayed it to have been. Merk wrote that, while belief in the beneficent mission of democracy was central to American history, aggressive \"continentalism\" were aberrations supported by only a minority of Americans, all of them Democrats. Some Democrats were also opposed; the Democrats of Louisiana opposed annexation of Mexico,[76] while those in Mississippi supported it.[77]\\nThese events related to the Mexican–American War and had an effect on the American people living in the Southern Plains at the time. A case study by David Beyreis depicts these effects through the operations of a fur trading and Indian trading business named Bent, St. Vrain and Company during the period. The telling of this company shows that the idea of Manifest Destiny was not unanimously loved by all Americans and did not always benefit Americans. The case study goes on to show that this company could have ceased to exist in the name of territorial expansion.[78]\\nAfter the Mexican–American War ended in 1848, disagreements over the expansion of slavery made further annexation by conquest too divisive to be official government policy. Some, such as John Quitman, Governor of Mississippi, offered what public support they could. In one memorable case, Quitman simply explained that the state of Mississippi had \"lost\" its state arsenal, which began showing up in the hands of filibusters. Yet these isolated cases only solidified opposition in the North as many Northerners were increasingly opposed to what they believed to be efforts by Southern slave owners—and their friends in the North—to expand slavery through filibustering. Sarah P. Remond on January 24, 1859, delivered an impassioned speech at Warrington, England, that the connection between filibustering and slave power was clear proof of \"the mass of corruption that underlay the whole system of American government\".[79] The Wilmot Proviso and the continued \"Slave Power\" narratives thereafter, indicated the degree to which manifest destiny had become part of the sectional controversy.[80]\\nWithout official government support the most radical advocates of manifest destiny increasingly turned to military filibustering. Originally filibuster had come from the Dutch vrijbuiter and referred to buccaneers in the West Indies that preyed on Spanish commerce. While there had been some filibustering expeditions into Canada in the late 1830s, it was only by mid-century did filibuster become a definitive term. By then, declared the New-York Daily Times \"the fever of Fillibusterism is on our country. Her pulse beats like a hammer at the wrist, and there\\'s a very high color on her face.\"[81] Millard Fillmore\\'s second annual message to Congress, submitted in December 1851, gave double the amount of space to filibustering activities than the brewing sectional conflict. The eagerness of the filibusters, and the public to support them, had an international hue. Clay\\'s son, a diplomat in Portugal, reported that the invasion created a sensation in Lisbon.[82]\\nAlthough they were illegal, filibustering operations in the late 1840s and early 1850s were romanticized in the United States. The Democratic Party\\'s national platform included a plank that specifically endorsed William Walker\\'s filibustering in Nicaragua. Wealthy American expansionists financed dozens of expeditions, usually based out of New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco. The primary target of manifest destiny\\'s filibusters was Latin America but there were isolated incidents elsewhere. Mexico was a favorite target of organizations devoted to filibustering, like the Knights of the Golden Circle.[83] William Walker got his start as a filibuster in an ill-advised attempt to separate the Mexican states Sonora and Baja California.[84] Narciso López, a near second in fame and success, spent his efforts trying to secure Cuba from the Spanish Empire.\\nThe United States had long been interested in acquiring Cuba from the declining Spanish Empire. As with Texas, Oregon, and California, American policy makers were concerned that Cuba would fall into British hands, which, according to the thinking of the Monroe Doctrine, would constitute a threat to the interests of the United States. Prompted by O\\'Sullivan, in 1848 President Polk offered to buy Cuba from Spain for $100 million. Polk feared that filibustering would hurt his effort to buy the island, and so he informed the Spanish of an attempt by the Cuban filibuster López to seize Cuba by force and annex it to the United States, foiling the plot. Spain declined to sell the island, which ended Polk\\'s efforts to acquire Cuba. O\\'Sullivan eventually landed in legal trouble.[85]\\nFilibustering continued to be a major concern for presidents after Polk. Whigs presidents Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore tried to suppress the expeditions. When the Democrats recaptured the White House in 1852 with the election of Franklin Pierce, a filibustering effort by John A. Quitman to acquire Cuba received the tentative support of the president. Pierce backed off and instead renewed the offer to buy the island, this time for $130 million. When the public learned of the Ostend Manifesto in 1854, which argued that the United States could seize Cuba by force if Spain refused to sell, this effectively killed the effort to acquire the island. The public now linked expansion with slavery; if manifest destiny had once enjoyed widespread popular approval, this was no longer true.[86]\\nFilibusters like William Walker continued to garner headlines in the late 1850s, but to little effect. Expansionism was among the various issues that played a role in the coming of the war. With the divisive question of the expansion of slavery, Northerners and Southerners, in effect, were coming to define manifest destiny in different ways, undermining nationalism as a unifying force. According to Frederick Merk, \"The doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which in the 1840s had seemed Heaven-sent, proved to have been a bomb wrapped up in idealism.\"[87]\\nThe filibusterism of the era even opened itself up to some mockery among the headlines. In 1854, a San Francisco Newspaper published a satirical poem called \"Filibustering Ethics\". This poem features two characters, Captain Robb and Farmer Cobb. Captain Robb makes claim to Farmer Cobb\\'s land arguing that Robb deserves the land because he is Anglo-Saxon, has weapons to \"blow out\" Cobb\\'s brains, and nobody has heard of Cobb so what right does Cobb have to claim the land. Cobb argues that Robb doesn\\'t need his land because Robb already has more land than he knows what to do with. Due to threats of violence, Cobb surrenders his land and leaves grumbling that \"might should be the rule of right among enlightened nations.\"[88]\\nThe Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged 600,000 families to settle the West by giving them land (usually 160 acres) almost free. Over the course of 123 years, 200 million claims were made and over 270 million acres were settled, accounting for 10% of the land in the U.S.[89] They had to live on and improve the land for five years.[90] Before the American Civil War, Southern leaders opposed the Homestead Acts because they feared it would lead to more free states and free territories.[91] After the mass resignation of Southern senators and representatives at the beginning of the war, Congress was subsequently able to pass the Homestead Act.\\nIn some areas, the Homestead Act resulted in the direct removal of Indigenous communities.[92] According to American historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, all five nations of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" signed treaties with the Confederacy and initially supported them in hopes of dividing and weakening the U.S. so that they could remain on their land.[93] The United States Army, led by prominent Civil War generals such as William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip Sheridan, and George Armstrong Custer, waged wars on \"non-treaty Indians\" who continued to live on land that had already been ceded to the U.S. through treaty.[92][93] Homesteaders and other settlers soon followed and took possession of the land for farms and mining. Occasionally, white settlers would move ahead of the U.S. Army, into land that had not yet been settled by the United States, causing conflict with the Native people who still resided there. According to Anglo-American historian Julius Wilm, while the U.S. government did not approve of settlers moving ahead of the army, Indian Affairs officials did believe \"the move of frontier whites into the proximity of contested territory—be they homesteaders or parties interested in other pursuits—necessitated the removal of Indigenous nations.\"[92]\\nAccording to historian Hannah Anderson, the Homestead Act also led to environmental degradation. While it succeeded in settling and farming the land, the Act failed to preserve the land. Continuous plowing of the top soil made the soil vulnerable to erosion and wind, as well as stripping the nutrients from the ground. This deforestation and erosion would play a key role in the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. Intense logging caused a decrease in much of the forests and hunting harmed many of the native animal populations, including the bison, whose population was reduced to a few hundreds.[89]\\nThe final U.S. territorial expansion of the North American mainland came in 1867 when the U.S. purchased Alaska. In the aftermath of the Crimean War in the 1850s, Emperor Alexander II of Russia decided to relinquish control of the ailing Russian America (present-day Alaska) on fears that the territory would be easily be lost in any future war between Russia and the United Kingdom. In 1865, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward entered into negotiations with Russian minister Eduard de Stoeckl for the purchase of Alaska. Seward initially offered $5 million to Stoeckl; the two men settled on $7 million and on March 15, 1867, Seward presented a draft treaty to the U.S. Cabinet. Stoeckl\\'s superiors raised several concerns; to induce him to waive them, the final purchase price was increased to $7.2 million and on March 30, the treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate. The transfer ceremony took place in Sitka, Alaska on October 18. Russian and American soldiers paraded in front of the governor\\'s house; the Russian flag was lowered and the American flag raised amid peals of artillery.\\nThe purchase added 586,412 square miles (1,518,800\\xa0km2) of new territory to the United States, an area about twice the size of Texas. Reactions to the purchase in the United States were mostly positive, as many believed the possession of Alaska would serve as a base to expand American trade in Asia. Some opponents labeled the purchase as \"Seward\\'s Folly\", or \"Seward\\'s Icebox\",[94] as they contended that the United States had acquired useless land. Nearly all Russian settlers left Alaska in the aftermath of the purchase; Alaska attracted few new settlers until the Klondike Gold Rush began in 1896. Originally organized as the Department of Alaska, the area was renamed the District of Alaska and the Territory of Alaska before becoming the modern State of Alaska in 1959.\\nThe start of the Klondike Gold Rush brought 200,000 prospectors to Alaska. The gold rush greatly increased the U.S. government\\'s commitment to developing the industrial infrastructure, and in turn attracting new residents to maintain it. The increase in gold seekers brought epidemics and land conflicts between settlers and Indigenous Alaskans. According to Yupik historian Shari Huhndorf, \"These changing demographics transformed social relationships between Native and the newcomers and soon led to Jim Crow-like segregation supported by a rapidly expanding territorial government.\"[95]\\nIn 1905, the Nelson Act was passed, which allowed the Territory of Alaska to open schools outside of incorporated towns and run them outside of the federal Bureau of Education\\'s control. According to historian Carol Barnhardt, the Territory of Alaska opened schools for \"white children and children of mixed blood leading a civilized life,\" while schools for Native children were still run by the Bureau of Education, which operated with the belief that it was important to transform Native Alaskans, along with all Indigenous people in America, into civilized Christians. The U.S. government saw education as the most effective way to achieve this goal. Overall, there was little recognition of the important differences between different groups of Indigenous people. The federal Bureau of Education also extended services such as medical services, cooperative stores, and a ship to supply remote coastal villages, slowly reducing the self-sufficiency of Native communities and allowing the U.S. government to assume more control of the lives of Native Alaskans.[96] The effects of the Alaska Purchase are still felt by Native Alaskans. According to Inuit author Sheila Watt-Cloutier, \"The land that is such an important part of our spirit, our culture, and our physical and economic well-being is becoming an often unpredictable and precarious place for us.\"[97]\\nManifest destiny had serious consequences for Native Americans, since continental expansion implicitly meant the occupation and annexation of Native American land, sometimes to expand slavery. This ultimately led to confrontations and wars with several groups of native peoples via Indian removal.[98][99][100][101] The United States continued the European practice of recognizing only limited land rights of Indigenous peoples. In a policy formulated largely by Henry Knox, Secretary of War in the Washington Administration, the U.S. government sought to expand into the west through the purchase of Native American land in treaties. Only the Federal Government could purchase Indian lands, and this was done through treaties with tribal leaders. Whether a tribe actually had a decision-making structure capable of making a treaty was a controversial issue. The national policy was for the Indians to join American society and become \"civilized\", which meant no more wars with neighboring tribes or raids on white settlers or travelers, and a shift from hunting to farming and ranching. Advocates of civilization programs believed that the process of settling native tribes would greatly reduce the amount of land needed by the Native Americans, making more land available for homesteading by white Americans. Thomas Jefferson believed that, while the Indigenous people of America were intellectual equals to whites,[102] they had to assimilate to and live like the whites or inevitably be pushed aside by them.[103]\\nAccording to historian Jeffrey Ostler, Jefferson believed that once assimilation was no longer possible, he advocated for the extermination of Indigenous people.[104][page\\xa0needed]\\n\\nOn 27 February 1803, Jefferson wrote in a letter to William Henry Harrison:\"but this letter being unofficial, & private, I may with safety give you a more extensive view of our policy respecting the Indians... Our system is to live in perpetual peace with the Indians, to cultivate an affectionate attachment from them, by everything just & liberal which we can do for them within the bounds of reason, and by giving them effectual protection against wrongs from our own people. The decrease of game rendering their subsistence by hunting insufficient, we wish to draw them to agriculture, to spinning & weaving... when they withdraw themselves to the culture of a small piece of land, they will perceive how useless to them are their extensive forests, and will be willing to pare them off from time to time in exchange for necessaries for their farms & families. At our trading houses too we mean to sell so low as merely to repay us cost and charges so as neither to lessen or enlarge our capital. this is what private traders cannot do, for they must gain; they will consequently retire from the competition, & we shall thus get clear of this pest without giving offence or umbrage to the Indians. in this way our settlements will gradually circumbscribe & approach the Indians, & they will in time either incorporate with us as citizens of the U.S. or remove beyond the Mississippi.\"[105]Noted by Law Scholar and professor Robert J. Miller, Thomas Jefferson \"Understood and utilized the Doctrine of Discovery [aka Manifest destiny] through his political careers and was heavily involved in using the Doctrine against Indian tribes.\"[106] Jefferson was \"often immersed in Indian affairs through his legal and political careers\" and \"was also well acquainted with the process Virginia governments had historically used to extinguish Indian [land] titles\".[106] Jefferson used this knowledge to make the Louisiana purchase in 1803, aided in the construction of the Indian Removal Policy, and laid the ground work for removing Native American tribes further and further into eventual small reservation territories.[106][40][104]\\nThe idea of \"Indian removal\" gained traction in the context of manifest destiny and, with Jefferson as one of the main political voices on the subject, accumulated advocates who believed that American Indians would be better off moving away from white settlers.[105] The removal effort was further solidified through policy by Andrew Jackson when he signed the Indian Removal Act in 1830.[107] In his First Annual Message to Congress in 1829, Jackson stated with regards to removal: I suggest for your consideration the propriety of setting apart an ample district west of the Mississippi, and without the limits of any state or territory now formed, to be guaranteed to the Indian tribes as long as they shall occupy it, each tribe having a distinct control over the portion designated for its use. There they may be secured in the enjoyment of governments of their own choice, subject to no other control from the United States than such as may be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribes. There the benevolent may endeavor to teach them the arts of civilization, and, by promoting union and harmony among them, to raise up an interesting commonwealth, destined to perpetuate the race and to attest the humanity and justice of this government.\"After major exploration and colonization to the western parts of the United States, resources and industry were needed to support such colonies.[62] Colville scholar Dina Gilo-Whitaker outlines how during this process, promises of innovative technologies and abundant resources were made to indigenous people as the settlers effectively began damming rivers, imposing railways, and seeking natural resources and minerals through mining and excavation of Native American lands.[62] According to historians Boyd Cothran and Ned Blackhawk, this influx of trade, industrialization, and development of transportation corridors killed surrounding livestock, caused waterway damage, and created sickness and disease for the Native American peoples living in those regions.[63]\\nHistorian Jeffery Ostler comments on some of the general theories about native American population decline due to these environmental factors. He shows that, over the course of this period, there were many forces \"of destruction, including enslavement, disease, material deprivation, malnutrition, and social stress.\"[104]\\nFollowing the forced removal of many Indigenous Peoples, Americans increasingly believed that Native American ways of life would eventually disappear as the United States expanded.[108] Humanitarian advocates of removal believed that American Indians would be better off moving away from whites. As historian Reginald Horsman argued in his influential study Race and Manifest Destiny, racial rhetoric increased during the era of manifest destiny. Americans increasingly believed that Native American ways of life would \"fade away\" as the United States expanded. As an example, this idea was reflected in the work of one of America\\'s first great historians, Francis Parkman, whose landmark book The Conspiracy of Pontiac was published in 1851. Parkman wrote that after the French defeat in the French and Indian War, Indians were \"destined to melt and vanish before the advancing waves of Anglo-American power, which now rolled westward unchecked and unopposed\". Parkman emphasized that the collapse of Indian power in the late 18th century had been swift and was a past event.[109]\\nIndian removal policies led to the current day reservation system which allocated territories to individual tribes. According to scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker, \"the treaties also created reservations that would confine Native people into smaller territories far smaller than they had for millenia been accustomed to, diminishing their ability to feed themselves.\"[62] According to author and scholar David Rich Lewis, these reservations had much higher population densities than indigenous homelands. As a result, \"the consolidation of native peoples in the 19th century allowed epidemic diseases to rage through their communities.\"[110] In addition to this \"a result of changing subsistence patterns and environments-contributed to an explosion of dietary-related illness like diabetes, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, cirrhosis, obesity, gallbladder disease, hypertension, and heart disease.\"[110]\\nIn 1859, Reuben Davis, a member of the House of Representatives from Mississippi, articulated one of the most expansive visions of manifest destiny on record:\\nWe may expand so as to include the whole world. Mexico, Central America, South America, Cuba, the West India Islands, and even England and France [we] might annex without inconvenience... allowing them with their local Legislatures to regulate their local affairs in their own way. And this, Sir, is the mission of this Republic and its ultimate destiny.[111]As the Civil War faded into history, the term manifest destiny experienced a brief revival. Protestant missionary Josiah Strong, in his best-seller of 1885, Our Country, argued that the future was devolved upon America since it had perfected the ideals of civil liberty, \"a pure spiritual Christianity\", and concluded, \"My plea is not, Save America for America\\'s sake, but, Save America for the world\\'s sake.\"[112]\\nIn the 1892 U.S. presidential election, the Republican Party platform proclaimed: \"We reaffirm our approval of the Monroe doctrine and believe in the achievement of the manifest destiny of the Republic in its broadest sense.\"[113] What was meant by \"manifest destiny\" in this context was not clearly defined, particularly since the Republicans lost the election.\\nIn the 1896 election, the Republicans recaptured the White House and held on to it for the next 16 years. During that time, manifest destiny was cited to promote overseas expansion. Whether or not this version of manifest destiny was consistent with the continental expansionism of the 1840s was debated at the time, and long afterwards.[114]\\nFor example, when President William McKinley advocated annexation of the Republic of Hawaii in 1898, he said that \"We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is manifest destiny.\" On the other hand, former President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat who had blocked the annexation of Hawaii during his administration, wrote that McKinley\\'s annexation of the territory was a \"perversion of our national destiny\". Historians continued that debate; some have interpreted American acquisition of other Pacific island groups in the 1890s as an extension of manifest destiny across the Pacific Ocean. Others have regarded it as the antithesis of manifest destiny and merely imperialism.[115]\\nIn 1898, the United States intervened in the Cuban insurrection and launched the Spanish–American War to force Spain out. According to the terms of the Treaty of Paris, Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba and ceded the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United States. The terms of cession for the Philippines involved a payment of the sum of $20 million by the United States to Spain. The treaty was highly contentious and denounced by William Jennings Bryan, who tried to make it a central issue in the 1900 election. He was defeated in landslide by McKinley.[116]\\nThe Teller Amendment, passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate before the war, which proclaimed Cuba \"free and independent\", forestalled annexation of the island. The Platt Amendment (1902) then established Cuba as a virtual protectorate of the United States.[117]\\nThe acquisition of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines after the war with Spain marked a new chapter in U.S. history. Traditionally, territories were acquired by the United States for the purpose of becoming new states on equal footing with already existing states. These islands were acquired as colonies rather than prospective states. The process was validated by the Insular Cases. The Supreme Court ruled that full constitutional rights did not automatically extend to all areas under American control.[118]\\nAccording to Frederick Merk, these colonial acquisitions marked a break from the original intention of manifest destiny. Previously, \"Manifest Destiny had contained a principle so fundamental that a Calhoun and an O\\'Sullivan could agree on it—that a people not capable of rising to statehood should never be annexed. That was the principle thrown overboard by the imperialism of 1899.\"[119] Albert J. Beveridge maintained the contrary at his September 25, 1900, speech in the Auditorium, at Chicago. He declared that the current desire for Cuba and the other acquired territories was identical to the views expressed by Washington, Jefferson and Marshall. Moreover, \"the sovereignty of the Stars and Stripes can be nothing but a blessing to any people and to any land.\"[120] The nascent revolutionary government, desirous of independence, resisted the United States in the Philippine–American War in 1899; it won no support from any government anywhere and collapsed when its leader was captured. William Jennings Bryan denounced the war and any form of future overseas expansion, writing, \"\\'Destiny\\' is not as manifest as it was a few weeks ago.\"[121]\\nIn 1917, all Puerto Ricans were made full American citizens via the Jones Act, which also provided for a popularly elected legislature and a bill of rights, and authorized the election of a Resident Commissioner who has a voice (but no vote) in Congress.[122] In 1934, the Tydings–McDuffie Act put the Philippines on a path to independence, which was realized in 1946 with the Treaty of Manila. The Guam Organic Act of 1950 established Guam alongside Puerto Rico as an unincorporated unorganized territory of the United States, provided for the structure of the island\\'s civilian government, and granted the people U.S. citizenship.\\nThe belief in an American mission to promote and defend democracy throughout the world, as expounded by Jefferson and his \"Empire of Liberty\", and continued by Lincoln, Wilson and George W. Bush,[123] continues to have an influence on American political ideology.[124][125] Under Douglas MacArthur, the Americans \"were imbued with a sense of manifest destiny,\" says historian John Dower.[126]\\nAfter the turn of the 19th century to the 20th century, the phrase manifest destiny declined in usage, as territorial expansion ceased to be promoted as being a part of America\\'s \"destiny\". Under President Theodore Roosevelt the role of the United States in the New World was defined, in the 1904 Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, as being an \"international police power\" to secure American interests in the Western Hemisphere. Roosevelt\\'s corollary contained an explicit rejection of territorial expansion. In the past, manifest destiny had been seen as necessary to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Western Hemisphere, but now expansionism had been replaced by interventionism as a core value associated with the doctrine.[127]\\nPresident Wilson continued the policy of interventionism in the Americas, and attempted to redefine both manifest destiny and America\\'s \"mission\" on a broader, worldwide scale. Wilson led the United States into World War I with the argument that \"The world must be made safe for democracy.\" In his 1920 message to Congress after the war, Wilson stated:\\n... I think we all realize that the day has come when Democracy is being put upon its final test. The Old World is just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as asserted in the name, but without the authority and sanction, of the multitude. This is the time of all others when Democracy should prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail.This was the only time a president had used the phrase \"manifest destiny\" in his annual address. Wilson\\'s version of manifest destiny was a rejection of expansionism and an endorsement (in principle) of self-determination, emphasizing that the United States had a mission to be a world leader for the cause of democracy. This U.S. vision of itself as the leader of the \"Free World\" would grow stronger in the 20th century after the end  of World War II, although rarely would it be described as \"manifest destiny\", as Wilson had done.[128]\\n\"Manifest destiny\" is sometimes used by critics of U.S. foreign policy to characterize interventions in the Middle East and elsewhere. In this usage, \"manifest destiny\" is interpreted as the underlying cause of what is denounced by some as \"American imperialism\". A more positive-sounding phrase devised by scholars at the end of the 20th century is \"nation building\", and State Department official Karin Von Hippel notes that the U.S. has \"been involved in nation-building and promoting democracy since the middle of the 19th century and \\'Manifest Destiny\\'\".[129]\\nMany studies suggest environmental changes that directly impact Indigenous communities due to the result of European colonization and settlement, according to scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker, when manifest destiny reached California and Oregon, \"Waters were diverted, interrupting farming practices: ancient food sources are eliminated: tribal self-determination was compromised with dams built on treaty adds: entire ecosystems were altered, interrupting cultural practices and dividing families: trauma inflicted by disruptions contributed to failing health conditions in tribal communities.\"[62]\\nFurther, \"sudden loss of salmon-based economies and spiritual traditions was a seismic shock to cultures and psyches of the people who collectively call themselves Salmon People.\" \"Specifically, \\'The Karuk are a fishing people who have sustainably managed their Klamath River fishery through the use of ceremony and harvest techniques for tens of thousands of years. Since the arrival of non-Indians in the 1850s, however, the salmon populations have been damaged by overfishing and the degradation of their habitat.\" \"Scholars such as environmental sociologist Kari Norgaard have shown that these issues continue into the present moment: \"Ron Reed served as the Karuk tribal representative for the relicensing process. Reed became convinced that the lack of healthy food, specifically the loss of salmon, was directly affecting the health of his people, leading to high rates of diabetes, heart disease, and a decreased life expectancy.\"[130]\\nOther environmental changes as a result of European settlement were discovered as a result of the pre-industrial era, according to historian Boyd Cothran, \"It coincided with a national timber boom and the concurrent near exhaustion of the Great Lakes forests, leading American businesses to clamor for access to the vast timber stands located on many western Indian Reservations.\"[131]\\nBiomolecular archaeologist Eric J. Guiry has shown that this deforestation had increasingly negative effects on Great Lakes ecosystems: \\'in comparison with the industrial era...\"Aquatic disruptions in great lakes have been linked to timber extraction through the loss of ecological resources. \"Results show that, in comparison with the industrial era, the nitrogen cycle and trophic structure of the Great Lakes ecosystems remained remarkably stable until the 1830s, despite millennia of Indigenous agricultural and other land management, decades of European settlement, and climatic fluctuations. After this time, increased logging from forestry and agriculture induced soil erosion caused an unprecedented and abrupt bottom-up shift throughout the entire aquatic ecosystem of Lake Ontario.\"[132]\\nCritics have condemned manifest destiny as an ideology used to justify dispossession and genocide against indigenous peoples.[133] Critics  argue it resulted in the forceful settler-colonial displacement of Indigenous Americans in order to carry out colonial expansion.[7]\\nCritics at the time of the country\\'s growing desire for expansion  doubted the country\\'s ability to rule such an extensive empire.[134]\\n',\n",
       "  'Edward Paul Abbey (January 29, 1927 – March 14, 1989) was an American author and essayist noted for his advocacy of environmental issues, criticism of public land policies, and anarchist political views. His best-known works include the novel The Monkey Wrench Gang, which has been cited as an inspiration by radical environmental groups, and the non-fiction work Desert Solitaire.\\nAbbey was born in Indiana, Pennsylvania on January 29, 1927 to Mildred Postlewait and Paul Revere Abbey. Mildred was a schoolteacher and a church organist, and gave Abbey an appreciation for classical music and literature. Paul was a socialist, anarchist, and atheist whose views strongly influenced Abbey.[1]\\nAbbey graduated from high school in Indiana, Pennsylvania, in 1945. Eight months before his 18th birthday, when he faced with being conscripted into the U.S. military, Abbey decided to explore the American southwest. He traveled by foot, bus, hitchhiking, and freight train hopping.[2] During this trip he fell in love with the desert country of the Four Corners region. Abbey wrote:\\n\"[...] crags and pinnacles of naked rock, the dark cores of ancient volcanoes, a vast and silent emptiness smoldering with heat, color, and indecipherable significance, above which floated a small number of pure, clear, hard-edged clouds. For the first time, I felt I was getting close to the West of my deepest imaginings, the place where the tangible and the mythical became the same.\"[3][4][5]\\nIn the U.S. Army,[6] Abbey applied for a clerk typist position but instead he served two years as a military police officer in Italy. Abbey was promoted in the army twice but due to his tendency to oppose authority, was twice demoted and was honorably discharged[2] as a private. His experience in the military left him with a distrust for large institutions and regulations which influenced his writing throughout his career and strengthened his anarchist beliefs.[7]\\nWhen he returned to the United States, Abbey took advantage of the G.I. Bill to attend the University of New Mexico, where he received a B.A. in philosophy and English in 1951, and a master\\'s degree in philosophy in 1956.[2][8][9] During his time in college, Abbey supported himself by working a variety of odd jobs, including being a newspaper reporter and bartending in Taos, New Mexico. During this time he had few male friends but had close relationships with a number of women. Shortly before getting his bachelor\\'s degree, Abbey married his first wife, Jean Schmechal (another UNM student).[10] While an undergraduate, Abbey was the editor of a student newspaper in which he published an article titled \"Some Implications of Anarchy\". A cover quotation of the article, \"ironically attributed to Louisa May Alcott\" stated \"Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest.\" University officials seized all of the copies of the issue, and removed Abbey from the editorship of the paper.[11]\\nUpon receiving his honorable discharge papers, he sent it back to the department with the words \"Return to Sender\". The FBI took note and added a note to his file which was opened in 1947 when Edward Abbey committed an act of civil disobedience; he posted a letter while in college urging people to rid themselves of their draft cards.[12] Abbey was on the FBI’s watch-list since then and he was watched throughout his life. In 1952 Abbey wrote a letter against the draft in times of peace and again the FBI took notice writing, \"Edward Abbey is against war and military.\" Throughout his life the FBI took notes building a profile on Abbey, observing his movements and interviewing many people who knew him. Towards the later part of his life, Abbey learned of the FBI’s interest in him and said \"I’d be insulted if they weren’t watching me\".[7]\\nAfter graduating, Schmechal and Abbey traveled together to Edinburgh, Scotland,[10] where Abbey spent a year at Edinburgh University as a Fulbright scholar.[8][10] During this time, Abbey and Schmechal separated and ended their marriage.[10] In 1951 Abbey began having an affair with Rita Deanin,[13] who in 1952 would become his second wife after he and Schmechal divorced. Deanin and Abbey had two children, Joshua N. Abbey and Aaron Paul Abbey.[14]\\nAbbey\\'s master\\'s thesis explored anarchism and the morality of violence, asking the two questions: \"To what extent is the current association between anarchism and violence warranted?\" and \"In so far as the association is a valid one, what arguments have the anarchists presented, explicitly or implicitly, to justify the use of violence?\".[15] After receiving his master\\'s degree, Abbey spent 1957 at Stanford University on a Wallace Stegner Creative Writing Fellowship.[8]\\nIn 1956 and 1957, Abbey worked as a seasonal ranger for the United States National Park Service at Arches National Monument (now a national park), near the town of Moab, Utah. Abbey held the position from April to September each year, during which time he maintained trails, greeted visitors, and collected campground fees. He lived in a house trailer that had been provided to him by the Park Service, as well as in a ramada that he built himself. During his stay at Arches, Abbey accumulated a large volume of notes and sketches which later formed the basis of his first non-fiction work, Desert Solitaire.[16] Abbey\\'s second son Aaron was born in 1959, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[17]\\nIn the 1960s Abbey worked as a seasonal park ranger at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, on the border of Arizona and Mexico. [citation needed] In 1961, the movie version of his second novel, The Brave Cowboy, with screenplay by Dalton Trumbo, was being shot on location in New Mexico by Kirk Douglas who had purchased the novel\\'s screen rights and was producing and starring in the film, released in 1962 as Lonely Are the Brave. Douglas once said that when Abbey visited the film set, he looked and talked so much like friend Gary Cooper that Douglas was disconcerted. However, over 25 years later when Abbey died, Douglas wrote that he had \\'never met\\' him.[18]  In 1981, his third novel,  Fire on the Mountain, was also adapted into a TV movie by the same title.[18]\\nOn October 16, 1965 Abbey married Judy Pepper, who accompanied Abbey as a seasonal park ranger in the Florida Everglades, and then as a fire lookout in Lassen Volcanic National Park.[19] Judy was separated from Abbey for extended periods of time while she attended the University of Arizona to get her master\\'s degree. During this time, Abbey slept with other women—something that Judy gradually became aware of, causing their marriage to suffer.[20] On August 8, 1968 Pepper gave birth to a daughter, Susannah \"Susie\" Mildred Abbey. Ed purchased the family a home in Sabino Canyon, outside of Tucson.[21] Judy died of leukemia on July 11, 1970, an event that crushed Abbey, causing him to go into \"bouts of depression and loneliness\" for years. It was to Judy that he dedicated his book Black Sun. However, the book was not an autobiographical novel about his relationship with Judy. Rather it was a story about a woman with whom Abbey had an affair in 1963. Abbey finished the first draft of Black Sun in 1968, two years before Judy died, and it was \"a bone of contention in their marriage\".[22][23]\\nDesert Solitaire, Abbey\\'s fourth book and first non-fiction work, was published in 1968. In it, he describes his stay in the canyon country of southeastern Utah from 1956 to 1957.[24] Desert Solitaire is regarded as one of the finest nature narratives in American literature, and has been compared to Aldo Leopold\\'s A Sand County Almanac[citation needed] and Thoreau\\'s Walden.[25] In it, Abbey vividly describes the physical landscapes of southern Utah and delights in his isolation as a backcountry park ranger, recounting adventures in the nearby canyon country and mountains. He also attacks what he terms the \"industrial tourism\" and resulting development in the national parks (\"national parking lots\"), rails against the Glen Canyon Dam, and comments on various other subjects.[citation needed]  In 1973, Abbey married his fourth wife Renee Downing. However, Abbey was always gone so they divorced after four years of marriage.[26]\\nAbbey met his fifth and final wife, Clarke Cartwright in 1978,[27] and married her in 1982.[28] Together they had two children, Rebecca Claire Abbey and Benjamin C. Abbey.[29] In 1995, Abbey\\'s granddaughter, Sophia Abbey-Kuipers, was born.\\nIn 1984, Abbey went back to the University of Arizona to teach courses in creative writing and hospitality management. During this time, he continued working on his book Fool\\'s Progress.[30]\\nIn July 1987, Abbey went to the Earth First! Rendezvous at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. While there, he was involved in a heated debate over his views on immigration with an anarchist communist group known as Alien Nation.[31] Abbey devoted an entire chapter in his book Hayduke Lives to the events that took place at the Rendezvous.[32] In autumn of 1987, the Utne Reader published a letter by Murray Bookchin which claimed that Abbey, Garrett Hardin, and the members of Earth First! were racists and eco-terrorists. Abbey was extremely offended, and demanded a public apology, stating that he was neither racist nor a supporter of terrorism. All three of those Bookchin labelled \"racist\" opposed illegal immigration into the United States, contending that population growth would cause further harm to the environment. Regarding the accusation of \"eco-terrorism\", Abbey responded that the tactics he supported were trying to defend against the terrorism he felt was committed by government and industry against living beings and the environment.[33]\\nOne final paragraph of advice: [...] It is not enough to fight for the land; it is even more important to enjoy it. While you can. While it’s still here.\\nSo get out there and hunt and fish and mess around with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the forests, climb the mountains, bag the peaks, run the rivers, breathe deep of that yet sweet and lucid air, sit quietly for a while and contemplate the precious stillness, the lovely, mysterious, and awesome space.\\nEnjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive, and I promise you this much; I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies, over those desk-bound men and women with their hearts in a safe deposit box, and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this; You will outlive the bastards.\\nEdward Abbey died on March 14, 1989,[35] at the age of 62, in his home in Tucson, Arizona. His death was due to complications from surgery; he suffered four days of esophageal hemorrhaging due to esophageal varices, these often a consequence of portal hypertension, commonly due to cirrhosis.[36] Showing his sense of humor, he left a message for anyone who asked about his final words: \"No comment.\" Abbey also left instructions on what to do with his remains: Abbey wanted his body transported in the bed of a pickup truck, and wished to be buried as soon as possible. He did not want to be embalmed or placed in a coffin. Instead, he preferred to be placed inside of an old sleeping bag, and requested that his friends disregard all state laws concerning burial. \"I want my body to help fertilize the growth of a cactus or cliff rose or sagebrush or tree.\" said the message. For his funeral, Abbey stated \"No formal speeches desired, though the deceased will not interfere if someone feels the urge. But keep it all simple and brief.\" He requested gunfire and bagpipe music, a cheerful and raucous wake, \"[a]nd a flood of beer and booze! Lots of singing, dancing, talking, hollering, laughing, and lovemaking.\"[36][37]\\nA 2003 Outside article described how his friends honored his request:\\n\"The last time Ed smiled was when I told him where he was going to be buried,\" says Doug Peacock, an environmental crusader in Edward Abbey\\'s inner circle. On March 14, 1989, the day Abbey died from esophageal bleeding at 62, Peacock, along with his friend Jack Loeffler, his father-in-law Tom Cartwright, and his brother-in-law Steve Prescott, wrapped Abbey\\'s body in his blue sleeping bag, packed it with dry ice, and loaded Cactus Ed into Loeffler\\'s Chevy pickup. After stopping at a liquor store in Tucson for five cases of beer, and some whiskey to pour on the grave, they drove off into the desert. The men searched for the right spot the entire next day and finally turned down a long rutted road, drove to the end, and began digging. That night they buried Ed and toasted the life of America\\'s prickliest and most outspoken environmentalist.[38]Abbey\\'s body was buried in the Cabeza Prieta Desert in Pima County, Arizona, where \"you\\'ll never find it.\" The friends carved a marker on a nearby stone, reading:[39][40]\\nEDWARD\\nPAUL\\nABBEY\\n1927–1989\\nNo Comment\\nIn late March, about 200 friends of Abbey\\'s gathered near the Saguaro National Monument near Tucson and held the wake he requested. A second, much larger wake was held in May, just outside his beloved Arches National Park, with such notables as Terry Tempest Williams and Wendell Berry speaking.[citation needed]\\nAbbey\\'s literary influences included Aldo Leopold, Henry David Thoreau, Gary Snyder, Peter Kropotkin, and A. B. Guthrie, Jr.[45][46] Although often compared to authors like Thoreau or Aldo Leopold, Abbey did not wish to be known as a nature writer, saying that he didn\\'t understand \"why so many want to read about the world out-of-doors, when it\\'s more interesting simply to go for a walk into the heart of it.\"[47] The theme that most interested Abbey was that of the struggle for personal liberty against the totalitarian techno-industrial state, with wilderness being the backdrop in which this struggle took place.[48] Most of Abbey\\'s writing criticizes the park services and American society for its reliance on motor vehicles and technology. He wanted to preserve the wilderness as a refuge for humans and believed that modernization was making us forget what was truly important in life.[26]\\nRegarding his writing style, Abbey states: \"I write in a deliberately provocative and outrageous manner because I like to startle people. I hope to wake up people. I have no desire to simply soothe or please. I would rather risk making people angry than putting them to sleep. And I try to write in a style that\\'s entertaining as well as provocative. It\\'s hard for me to stay serious for more than half a page at a time.\"[49] Abbey felt that it was the duty of all authors to \"speak the truth--especially unpopular truth. Especially truth that offends the powerful, the rich, the well-established, the traditional, the mythic\".[50]\\nAbbey\\'s abrasiveness, opposition to anthropocentrism, and outspoken writings made him the object of much controversy. Agrarian author Wendell Berry claimed that Abbey was regularly criticized by mainstream environmental groups because Abbey often advocated controversial positions that were very different from those which environmentalists were commonly expected to hold.[51]\\nAbbey has also drawn criticism for what some regard as his racist and sexist views.[52] In an essay called \"Immigration and Liberal Taboos\", collected in his 1988 book One Life at a Time, Please, Abbey expressed his opposition to immigration (\"legal or illegal, from any source\") into the United States: \"(I)t occurs to some of us that perhaps ever-continuing industrial and population growth is not the true road to human happiness, that simple gross quantitative increase of this kind creates only more pain, dislocation, confusion and misery. In which case it might be wise for us as American citizens to consider calling a halt to the mass influx of even more millions of hungry, ignorant, unskilled, and culturally-morally-genetically impoverished people. At least until we have brought our own affairs into order. Especially when these uninvited millions bring with them an alien mode of life which—let us be honest about this—is not appealing to the majority of Americans. Why not? Because we prefer democratic government, for one thing; because we still hope for an open, spacious, uncrowded, and beautiful—yes, beautiful!—society, for another. The alternative, in the squalor, cruelty, and corruption of Latin America, is plain for all to see.\"[53]\\nIt is often stated that Abbey\\'s works played a significant role in precipitating the creation of Earth First!.[54] The Monkey Wrench Gang inspired environmentalists frustrated with mainstream environmentalist groups and what they saw as unacceptable compromises.

During the early 1880s, he went to Texas, where he stayed for 10 years, spending much of that time driving cattle on the western trails. In 1890, he tried working as a businessman, but the venture failed, so he tried gold-mining in Colorado and Nevada. In 1894, he settled in Colorado Springs, where he lived until his death.\\nHe began writing at the age of 43, publishing his most successful book, The Log of a Cowboy, in 1903. His other works include A Texas Matchmaker (1904), The Outlet (1905), Cattle Brands (1906), Reed Anthony, Cowman: An Autobiography (1907), Wells Brothers (1911), and The Ranch on the Beaver (1927).\\nThe Log of a Cowboy is an account of a five-month drive of 3,000 cattle from Brownsville, Texas, to Montana during 1882 along the Great Western Cattle Trail. Although the book is fiction, it is based on Adams\\'s own experiences, and it is considered by many to be literature\\'s best account of cowboy life.[4] Adams was disgusted by the unrealistic cowboy fiction being published in his time; The Log of a Cowboy was his response. It is still in print, and even modern reviewers consider it compelling. The Chicago Herald said: \"As a narrative of cowboy life, Andy Adams\\' book is clearly the real thing. It carries its own certificate of authentic first-hand experience on every page.\"\\n',\n",

Noted for his 1972 novel Bless Me, Ultima, Anaya was considered one of the founders of the canon of contemporary Chicano and New Mexican literature.[1][2]  The themes and cultural references of the novel, which were uncommon at the time of its publication, had a lasting impression on fellow Latino writers.   It was subsequently adapted into a film and an opera.\\nRudolfo Anaya was raised in Santa Rosa, New Mexico. His father, Martín Anaya, was a vaquero from a family of cattle workers and sheepherders. His mother, Rafaelita (Mares), was from a family composed of farmers from Puerto De Luna in the Pecos Valley of New Mexico.[3] Anaya grew up with two half-brothers, from his mother\\'s previous marriage, and four sisters. The beauty of the desert flatlands of New Mexico, referenced as the llano in Anaya\\'s writings, had a profound influence on his early childhood.[4]\\nAnaya\\'s family relocated from rural New Mexico to Albuquerque in 1952, when he was in the eighth grade.[5] He attended Albuquerque High School, graduating in 1956.[4] This experience later appeared as an autobiographical allusion in his novel Tortuga.[3] When he was 16 he sustained a spinal cord injury which left him temporarily paralyzed.[6] Following high school, he earned a B.A. in English and American Literature from the University of New Mexico in 1963. He went on to complete two master\\'s degrees at the University of New Mexico, one in 1968 for English and another in 1972 for guidance and counseling.[3] While earning his master\\'s degrees, Anaya worked as a high school English teacher in the Albuquerque public schools from 1963 until 1968.[4][7] In 1966, he married Patricia Lawless, who continued to support his writing.[3]\\nHe began writing his best-known work Bless Me, Ultima in 1963, with the manuscript completed and published by Quinto Sol in 1972.[3] Initially, Anaya faced tremendous difficulty getting his work published by mainstream publishing houses because of its unique combination of English and Spanish language, as well as its Chicano-centric content.[8] Independent publishing house Quinto Sol quickly published the book after awarding it the Premio Quinto Sol in 1971 for best novel written by a Chicano.[3] The book went on to sell over 300,000 copies in 21 printings.[9]  The themes and cultural references touched on in the novel were uncommon at the time of its publication.  Consequently, it ended up having a lasting impact on a generation of Latino writers.[10]\\nFollowing the book\\'s success, Anaya was invited to join the English faculty at the University of New Mexico in 1975, where he taught until his retirement in 1993.[8]\\nAnaya traveled extensively through both China in 1984, and South America following his retirement. His experiences in China are chronicled in his travel journal, A Chicano in China, published in 1986.[3][4]\\nDuring the 1990s, Anaya found an even wider audience as mainstream publishing house Warner books signed him on for a six-book deal beginning with the novel Alburquerque. He subsequently created the Sonny Baca mystery series which included Zia Summer, Rio Grande Fall, Jalamanta: A Message from the Desert, and Shaman Winter. The Anaya Reader, a collection of his works, followed.[4][9][11]\\nBless Me, Ultima was released as a feature film on February 22, 2013.[12] It was subsequently adapted into an opera three years later.[13] Anaya also published a number of books for children and young adults.

He was the youngest in a family of eleven children. He grew up on the family homestead and attended high school in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Barker graduated from New Mexico Highlands University.[2]\\nBarker worked as a Spanish teacher, high school principal, forest ranger, sergeant of the 502nd Engineers in France in World War I, trombone player in Doc Patterson\\'s Cowboy Band, and newspaper correspondent. From 1924 to 1926, Barker was a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives. He began writing and selling stories, articles, and poems as early as 1914 and became a full-time writer at the end of his legislative term.[3][4]\\nHe once estimated his career output at about 1,500 short stories and novelettes, about 1,200 factual articles, about 2,000 poems. They appeared in a broad range of publications from pulp magazines to such prestigious slicks as Saturday Evening Post and a varied array of general newspapers and magazines. He produced five volumes of poetry, one book of short stories and one novel, Little World Apart, as well as one western cookbook with Carol Truax. He was a co-writer for one episode of Sugarfoot in 1957.[5]\\nThe work probably best known to the general public was his poem, \"A Cowboy\\'s Christmas Prayer,\" which has been printed more than one hundred times, recorded by Tennessee Ernie Ford and Jimmy Dean, and plagiarized more than once. He won the Western Writers of America Spur Award twice and was the 1967 recipient of the Levi Strauss Saddleman Award for bringing honor and dignity to the Western legend. In 1975 he was named an honorary president of WWA, of which he was one of the founding fathers and an early president. Elsa also served a term as president. In 1978 he was the first living author to be inducted into the Hall of Fame of Great Westerners in the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City.\\nHe was well known as the \"Sage of Sapello\" and the \"Poet Lariat of New Mexico\".\\nBarker used to submit stories and poems to a bi-weekly Western pulp magazine called Ranch Romances. Sometime in the 1930s, he was asked by the editor to rewrite a story submitted by an old Texas cowhand named Jack Potter about his life of driving cattle. This started a collaboration between the two that lasted for years. Potter had two books of his published, including \"Lead Steer and Other Tales\" (1939). It that book he wrote how he met and courted his wife, Cordie, and how he proposed. With Jack\\'s permission, Barker turned that narrative into a poem entitled \"Jack Potter\\'s Courtin\\'\" That poem was published in Ranch Romances in September 1941. It has become one of S. Omar Barker\\'s most recited poems.\\nPrior to publication, however, Potter sent out a copy of \"Jack Potter\\'s Courtin\\'\" as a Christmas greeting in 1940. It was professionally printed on the letterhead of the Trail Drivers and Pioneers Association of New Mexico. The stationery also lists officers of the organization, including Jack M. Potter, President, and S. Omar Barker, Historian and Poet.\\nHe married Elsa McCormick of Hagerman, New Mexico, in 1927, and she also became a noted writer of Western stories.

Beach studied at Rollins College, Florida (1891–1896), the Chicago College of Law (1896–97), and Kent College of Law, Chicago (1899–1900).[2] In 1900 he was drawn to Alaska at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush.[3]\\nIn 1904, Beach was a member of the American water polo team which won the silver medal in the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis.\\nAfter five years of unsuccessful prospecting, he turned to writing. His second novel The Spoilers (1906) was based on a true story of corrupt government officials stealing gold mines from prospectors, which he witnessed while he was prospecting in Nome, Alaska.[4] The Spoilers became one of the best selling novels of 1906.\\nHis adventure novels, influenced by Jack London,[5] were immensely popular throughout the early 1900s. Beach was lionized as the \"Victor Hugo of the North,\" but others found his novels formulaic and predictable. Critics described them as cut from the \"he-man school\" of literature. Historian Stephen Haycox has said that many of Beach\\'s works are \"mercifully forgotten today.\"[6]\\nOne novel, The Silver Horde (1909), is set in Kalvik, a fictionalized community in Bristol Bay, Alaska, and tells the story of a down on his luck gold miner who discovers a greater wealth in Alaska\\'s run of salmon (silver horde) and decides to open a cannery. To accomplish this he must overcome the relentless opposition of the \"salmon trust,\" a fictionalized Alaska Packers\\' Association, which undercuts his financing, sabotages his equipment, incites a longshoremen\\'s riot and bribes his fishermen to quit. The story line includes a love interest as the protagonist is forced to choose between his fiancée, a spoiled banker\\'s daughter, and an earnest roadhouse operator, a woman of \"questionable virtue.\" Real-life cannery superintendent Crescent Porter Hale has been credited with being the inspiration for The Silver Horde, but it is unlikely Beach and Hale ever met.\\nAfter success in literature, many of his works were adapted into successful films; The Spoilers became a stage play, then was remade into movies five times from 1914 to 1955, with Gary Cooper and John Wayne each playing \"Roy Glennister\" in 1930 and 1942, respectively.\\nThe Silver Horde was twice made into a movie, as a silent film in 1920 starring Myrtle Stedman, Curtis Cooksey and Betty Blythe and directed by Frank Lloyd; and a talkie version The Silver Horde (1930) that starred Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea, and Evelyn Brent and was directed by George Archainbaud.\\nBeach occasionally produced his films and also wrote a number of plays to varying success. In 1926 Beach was paid $25,000 (~$344,617 in 2023) to write a brochure entitled The Miracle of Coral Gables to promote the real estate development of Coral Gables, Florida, a planned city.[7]\\nRex Beach moved to Sebring in the 1920s, where he lived at the Harder Hall Hotel before buying a home in town in 1929.[8] In 1949, two years after the death of his wife Edith, Beach committed suicide in Sebring, Florida at the age of 72.[9] In 2005, when the home Beach lived in was remodeled, a bullet was found in the wall, believed to be the bullet that ended his life.[10]\\nBeach served as the first president of the Rollins College Alumni Association. He and his wife are buried in front of the Alumni house.[11]\\nBeach, and his most famous novel, were commemorated in 2009 by the naming of a public pedestrian/bicycle trail in Dobbs Ferry, NY, a former place of residence.

Among his most successful efforts are \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\" and \"Farewell\" for that series and \"Johnny Tremain\" and \"The Liberty Tree\" for Johnny Tremain (Buena Vista, 1957).[1]Born the eldest of six children on the T.O. Ranch near Raton, New Mexico, to Howard and Edith \"Didi\" (née Herrington) Blackburn. His father worked for the O\\'Shaunnessy Engineering Company as an engineer and was sent to the ranch to install an irrigation system. The T.O. Ranch had its own internal railroad and was used in Blackburn\\'s novel Raton Pass.[2]\\nAfter the irrigation system was installed the family moved to La Salle, Colorado (where Edith\\'s father had a farm), and Howard Blackburn tried farming, then dry farming, several other jobs-including town marshal, and (with the help of financing from his father) opening a Ford Motor Company automotive dealership. After this failed, he got more help from his father and Howard took insurance classes in Denver and then became successful working for the Federal Surety Company in Denver. The family moved to Denver when Tom was in the fourth grade. Howard Blackburn was then put in charge of monitoring construction jobs for Federal Surety where the insurance company had bonded the contractor.[3] If the contractor failed to complete the project, Federal Surety would finish the contract with Howard in charge. Tom was put to work in menial jobs during the summer time at the various construction sites that his father was supervising.[4]\\nWhen Tom was older he helped his Uncle Cecil, who was in the produce business, pickup fresh vegetables from area farms.

       "  \"James Carlos Blake (born May 26, 1947) is an American writer of novels, novellas, short stories, and essays. His work has received extensive critical favor and several notable awards. He has been called “one of the greatest chroniclers of the mythical American outlaw life”[1] as well as “one of the most original writers in America today and … certainly one of the bravest.”[2] He is a recipient of the University of South Florida's Distinguished Humanities Alumnus Award and a member of the Texas Institute of Letters.\\nBlake has written about his boyhood in a memoir essay entitled “The Outsider” and has discussed his life and work in a profile in Texas Monthly and in a wide-ranging interview in Firsts. He was born in Tampico, Mexico, a third-generation Mexican descended from American, English, Irish, and Spanish ancestors—including a British pirate who was executed in Veracruz, Mexico—and is a naturalized American citizen. His father, Carlos Sebastian Blake Hernandez, was a civil engineer born and schooled in Mexico City. His mother, Estrella Maria Lozano Cano, was the daughter of a horse rancher and grew up on the family's ranch near Matamoros. Blake received his elementary education at St. Joseph's Academy in Brownsville, Texas and graduated from high school in Miami, Florida. After service in the U. S. Army Airborne (paratroopers), he earned BA and MA degrees at the University of South Florida Tampa Bay and an MFA degree from Bowling Green State University (Ohio), where he attended on a fellowship. He has worked as a snake-catcher, Volkswagen mechanic, swimming pool maintenance man, and county jail properties officer, but his primary occupation has been as a college instructor. He has taught at the University of South Florida, Bowling Green State University, Florida SouthWestern State College, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (Saudi Arabia), and Miami Dade College. In 1997, he left teaching to write full-time.\\nAlthough Blake wrote sporadically from his teens until his thirties, it was not until the early 1980s, while again living in Miami, that he began to write with purpose,[3] and over the next few years he published a number of short stories in a variety of literary journals. In 1995 he published his first novel, The Pistoleer, an account of the life and times of the infamous Texas outlaw, John Wesley Hardin. Structured as a sequence of first-person narratives—each of the dozens of chapters told by a different character—the novel was hailed as “an achievement by any standards, but as a first novel is simply astounding.”[4] It was a finalist for the 1995 Best Novel of the West award from the Western Writers of America. Despite its “western” setting, it was recognized as a significant literary work presenting not only the story of the title character, but also, through its vast array of narrators, a cultural mosaic of the South in the era of Reconstruction. The Pistoleer introduced several motifs that would recur in much of Blake's subsequent work—violence as art; honor and morality as existential codes; character as fate (a Heraclitean notion that Blake himself has cited as a pervasive theme in his fiction.[5]); and the outlaw as media celebrity.[6]\\nIn the ten years following the publication of The Pistoleer, Blake published eight more novels and a collection of short works, plus more short stories and two memoir essays. In 1997 his third novel, In the Rogue Blood, gained him considerable attention and won the prestigious Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction. Dealing with the misadventures of a pair of American brothers during the time of the U.S. war with Mexico in the late 1840s, In the Rogue Blood is generally regarded as one of the most compelling works in recent American literature to treat violence as a primary engine of U.S. history. It has been widely compared to Cormac McCarthy’s savage masterpiece, Blood Meridian.[7]\\nWhile most of Blake’s short stories—and a novella, “Texas Woman Blues” — are set in recent times, his four latest books, The Rules of Wolfe (2013), The House of Wolfe (2015), The Ways of Wolfe (2017), and The Bones of Wolfe (2020) are his first contemporary novels. All of his previous novels are set between the mid-19th-century and the late 1930s, and several of them feature historical figures as protagonists. In addition to Wes Hardin, his novels have centered on Pancho Villa, the Mexican bandit and revolutionary (The Friends of Pancho Villa); John Ashley of the notorious Ashley criminal gang in early twentieth-century Florida (Red Grass River); “Bloody Bill” Anderson, the Missouri guerrilla captain of the American Civil War (Wildwood Boys); Harry Pierpont, the 1930s gangster and leader of a band of bank robbers that included John Dillinger (Handsome Harry); and Stanley Ketchel, the ragtime-era boxing champion who was murdered at age twenty-four (The Killings of Stanley Ketchel). Even in those of his novels whose protagonists are created of whole cloth (In the Rogue Blood, A World of Thieves, Under the Skin, Country of the Bad Wolfes), real-life people play significant or cameo roles.[6]\\nSeveral of Blake's works have been published in foreign editions, and some are under film option, including The Killings of Stanley Ketchel, which has been optioned by Terence Winter, writer and executive producer of The Sopranos and creator of Boardwalk Empire.[8]\\nThe Friends of Pancho Villa was going to be turned into a movie by director Emir Kusturica, starring Johnny Depp in the leading role, but Depp pulled out. According to Blake, Kusturica spoke to Benicio del Toro about taking over the role, but the movie ultimately did not happen.\\nIn interviews writer/director Martin Koolhoven said Blake's novel In the Rogue Blood had an influence on his controversial Brimstone, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2016.

       "  'Bertha Muzzy Sinclair or Sinclair-Cowan, née Muzzy (November 15, 1871 – July 23, 1940), best known by her pseudonym B. M. Bower, was an American author who wrote novels, fictional short stories, and screenplays about the American Old West. Her works, featuring cowboys and cows of the Flying U Ranch in Montana, reflected  \"an interest in ranch life, the use of working cowboys as main characters (even in romantic plots), the occasional appearance of eastern types for the sake of contrast, a sense of western geography as simultaneously harsh and grand, and a good deal of factual attention to such matters as cattle branding and bronc busting.\"[1] She was married three times: to Clayton Bower in 1890, to Bertrand William Sinclair (also a Western author) in 1905, and to Robert Elsworth Cowan in 1921. However, she chose to publish under the name Bower.[2]\\nBorn Bertha Muzzy in Otter Tail County, Minnesota, to Washington Muzzy and Eunice Miner Muzzy, Bower moved with her family to a dryland homestead near Great Falls, Montana, in 1889.[3] That fall, just before her eighteenth birthday, she began teaching school in nearby Milligan Valley. The school was a small, hastily converted log outbuilding, and she taught twelve pupils. Her experiences as a teacher informed the characters of schoolma\\'ams who appear frequently in her in the writings, notably in The North Wind Do Blow (1937), in which a young, eastern-born schoolma\\'am teaches her first term in central Montana. After one term as a schoolteacher, Bower returned to her family\\'s homestead.[4]\\nOn December 21, 1890, Bower shocked her family by eloping with her first husband, Clayton J. Bower. Their marriage was unhappy. The newlyweds lived first with the Muzzy family, moving later to Great Falls and then to Big Sandy, Montana, in 1898. Her experiences in Big Sandy gave her intimate knowledge of cowboy life on the open range. Bower gave birth to three children during her marriage to Clayton:  Bertha Grace in 1891, Harold Clayton in 1893, and Roy Noel in 1896. Eventually, Clayton moved the family to a lonely hayfield cabin, which Bower nicknamed \"Bleak Cabin,\" about a mile out of Big Sandy. To help with rent, the Bowers accepted a boarder named Bill Sinclair. Sinclair, aged twenty-two, was nine years younger than Bower, but nevertheless a partnership began between them. Bower lent books to Sinclair and tutored him in writing while he helped her understand the finer points of cowpunching and critiqued the Western stories she had begun to write.[4]\\nIn the meantime, Bower\\'s first marriage had deteriorated. After Bower had published Chip of the Flying U, her husband had begun to call her \"my little red-headed gold mine.\" The final break came after he arrived home in a drunken rage. With Sinclair\\'s help and with money from the sale of Chip of the Flying U, Bower moved to Tacoma, Washington, to stay with her brother Chip and his wife Elvina. The divorce was finalized in 1905. Clayton took custody of Bertha Grace and Harry, while Bower moved back to Great Falls and took custody of Roy. Throughout this difficult time, Bower continued to advance her career, signing her first short-story writing contract for Popular Magazine in January 1905.[4]\\nBower and Sinclair married on August 13, 1905, at the Great Falls Methodist-Episcopal Church. They rented a two-story home at 111 Sixth Street North where they both focused on their writing careers. A daughter, Della Frances Sinclair, was born during a blizzard on January 24, 1907. That same hard winter destroyed the Sinclairs\\' breeding horse herd on land in eastern Valley County where they had hoped to move in the spring. After losing their herd, Bower and Sinclair left Montana for good and moved south and settled in a house on the coast in Santa Cruz, California. Both Bower and Sinclair continued to pursue successful careers as writers over the course of several moves to various houses in California. However, by late summer, 1911, Bower had separated from Sinclair and rented a house in San Jose, California. She also changed publishers, signing with the prestigious Boston publishing house Little, Brown & Company in August 1911.[4]\\nIn 1920, Bower moved to Hollywood and married her third husband, Robert \"Bud\" Cowan, a cowboy who she had met in Big Sandy. In 1921, Bower and Cowan reopened a silver mine in Nevada and operated it for several years until the Great Depression forced them to move again, this time to Depoe Bay, Oregon.[4] Their marriage lasted until Cowan\\'s death in 1939. Bower did not remarry again.[5]\\nBower began writing to \"save my sanity\" after moving to Big Sandy with her first husband. Seeking financial independence from Clayton, she began sending stories to publishers in 1900. She regularly wrote new material while continuing to send out her old stories once a month. Bower published her first short story, \"Strike of the Dishpan Brigade,\" locally in 1901.[6] Her first short story to be published nationally, \"Ghost in the Red Shirt,\" appeared in Lippincott’s Magazine in 1904.\\nLater that year, Bower published her first Western novel, Chip of the Flying U, as a serial in Popular Magazine by Street & Smith. The book introduced readers to the fictional Flying U Ranch and the \"Happy Family\" of cowboys who lived there. The story line centers on a cowboy named Chip and his relationship with Dr. Della Whitmore, a self-reliant doctor from the East who \"can shoot a coyote, laugh off a hazing, doctor a horse, and turn cowboys into pediatric orderlies.\"[7] Their relationship begins coldly when Della takes credit for a painting done by Chip. But they fall in love after Della restores credit to Chip and after Chip rescues Della from a runaway horse.[8] The book was so popular that it was re-released in hardcover in 1906 with three watercolor illustrations by famed painter Charlie Russell. Chip of the Flying U rocketed Bower to fame, and she wrote an entire series of novels set at the Flying U Ranch.[9]\\nBower went on to write 57 Western novels. She died in July 1940 in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 68.[10] By the time of her death, her books had sold more than two million copies, not counting her many short stories and articles.[11]\\nAccording to Elmer Kelton, Bower\\'s sales dropped when it was revealed that she was female.[12]\\nSeveral of Bower\\'s novels were turned into films.[13] Chip of the Flying U was adapted for film four times; however, each of these films significantly altered Bower\\'s narrative. Bower also collaborated with director Colin Campbell, writing stories and screenplays for seven Westerns under the name Bertha Muzzy Sinclair, including the 1921 film The Wolverine. She developed friendships with Gary Cooper and Tom Mix. Mix starred in the first adaptation of Chip of the Flying U (1914) as well as in three other films written by Bower: When the Cook Fell Ill (1914), The Lonesome Trail (1914), and Weary Goes A’Wooing (1915).[8] Bower used her experiences working within the studio system as the source material for several novels, including Jean of the Lazy A (1915), The Heritage of the Sioux (1915), The Phantom Herd (1916), and The Quirt (1920).[8]\\nBower\\'s novels have been praised for their accurate portrayal of cowboy life. She wrote factually about such things as cattle branding and bronc busting, having witnessed these events firsthand. Bower\\'s West is a place of change in which characters embrace new technologies from barbed wire to Kodak cameras. She infused her novels with humor. Her cowboys lightheartedly josh each other, and readers are invited to laugh at the ironic situations in which her characters are entangled. There is little violence in Bower\\'s writing. In Chip of the Flying U, the eponymous character does not even carry a six-shooter.[1] Instead, Bower\\'s writing is characterized by a lighthearted, pleasant mood. For example, in describing a ranch kitchen, she imagines a tea kettle \"singing placidly to itself and puffing steam with an air of lazy comfort, as if it were smoking a cigarette.\"[14]\\nReviewers praised Bower for her use of \"chaste English,\" her \"true-to-life fiction,\" her \"real background of life among the bow-legged brethren,\" and her \"playful, humorous vein.\" A 1922 New York Times review stated: \"there has always been an authenticity about them, a genuine smell of sagebrush and saddle leather, which many of her pretentious rivals lack. Her humor, too, is native and unforced, and lingers in the mind.\"[9]\\nBoth readers and reviewers frequently assumed that Bower was a man. In 1926, a reviewer for The New York Times called Bower \"a strong but not altogether silent man who, during the intermissions in his professional duties, has found time to write thirty-four books.\" Other reviewers dodged the question entirely by replacing the pronouns he or she with such vague epithets as \"this veteran novelist.\"[9]\\n Media related to B.

       "  '\\nLeigh Douglass Brackett (December 7, 1915 – March 24, 1978) was an American author and screenwriter. Nicknamed \"the Queen of Space Opera,\"[1] she was one of the most prominent female writers during the Golden Age of Science Fiction. As a screenwriter, she was best known for her collaborations with director Howard Hawks, mainly writing Westerns and crime films. She also worked on an early draft of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), elements of which remained in the film; she died before it went into production. \\nIn 1956, her book The Long Tomorrow made her the first woman ever shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Novel, and, along with C. L. Moore, one of the first two women ever nominated for a Hugo Award. In 2020, she posthumously won a Retro Hugo for her novel The Nemesis From Terra, originally published as \"Shadow Over Mars\" (Startling Stories, Fall 1944).\\nLeigh Brackett was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Her father died when she was very young; her mother did not remarry. She was a tomboy, \"tall\" and \"athletic\".[1] She attended a private girls\\' school in Santa Monica, California, where she was involved in theater and began writing.[1]\\nBrackett first published in her mid-20s; the science fiction story \"Martian Quest\" appeared in the February 1940 issue of Astounding Science Fiction.[2] Her earliest years as a writer (1940–1942) were her most productive. Some of her stories have social themes, such as \"The Citadel of Lost Ships\" (1943), which considers the effects on alien cultures of Earth\\'s expanding trade empire. At the time, she was an active member of the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society (LASFS), and participated in local science fiction fandom by contributing to the second issue of Pogo\\'s STF-ETTE, an all-female science fiction fanzine (probably the first such).[3]\\nBrackett\\'s first novel, No Good from a Corpse (1944),[2] was a hard-boiled mystery novel in the tradition of Raymond Chandler. The book led to her first big screenwriting assignment. After this, Brackett\\'s science fiction stories became more ambitious. Shadow Over Mars (1944) was her first novel-length story; though rough-edged, it marked the beginning of a new style influenced by the characterization of the 1940s detective story and film noir.[4] It won a Retro Hugo for best novel in 2020.\\nPlanet Stories published the novella \"Lorelei of the Red Mist\", in which the protagonist is a thief named Hugh Starke. Brackett finished the first half before turning it over to her close friend[5] Ray Bradbury, so that she could leave to work on the screenplay of The Big Sleep.\\nBrackett returned to science fiction writing in 1948 after her movie work. Between 1948 and 1951, she produced a series of science fiction adventure stories that were longer than her previous work, including classic representations of her planetary settings as \"The Moon that Vanished\" and the novel Sea-Kings of Mars (1949). The latter was later published as The Sword of Rhiannon.\\nIn \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\" (1949), Brackett created the character of Eric John Stark.[2] Stark, an orphan from Earth, is raised by the semi-sentient aboriginals of Mercury, who are later killed by Earthmen.[2] He is saved by a Terran official, who adopts and mentors Stark. When threatened, Stark reverts to the primitive N\\'Chaka, the \"man without a tribe\", who he was on Mercury. From 1949 to 1951, Brackett featured Stark (whose name echoes that of the hero in \"Lorelei of the Red Mist\") in three stories published in Planet Stories: \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\", \"Enchantress of Venus\", and \"Black Amazon of Mars\". With this last story, Brackett\\'s high adventure period ended.\\nBrackett adopted an elegiac tone in her stories, no longer celebrating the conflicts of frontier worlds but lamenting the passing of civilizations, and concentrating more on mood than plot.[citation needed] The stories\\' reflective, introspective nature is indicated in the titles: \"The Last Days of Shandakor\", \"Shannach—the Last\", and \"Last Call from Sector 9G\".\\n\"Last Call\" was published in the final issue (Summer 1955) of Planet Stories, which had been her most reliable publisher. After Planet Stories folded, and then Startling Stories and Thrilling Wonder Stories, Brackett lost her magazine market. The first phase of her career as a science fiction author ended. She produced other stories over the next decade, and revised and published some as novels. A new production of this period was The Long Tomorrow (1955), one of Brackett\\'s more critically acclaimed novels. It describes an agrarian, technophobic society that develops after a nuclear war.\\nAfter 1955, Brackett concentrated on writing for the more lucrative film and television markets. In 1963 and 1964, she briefly returned to her old Martian milieu with a pair of stories. \"The Road to Sinharat\" was an affectionate farewell to the world of \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\", and the other, with the intentionally ridiculous title of \"Purple Priestess of the Mad Moon\", borders on parody.[citation needed]\\nBrackett and her husband shared Guest of Honor duties at the 22nd World Science Fiction Convention in 1965 in Oakland, California.[6]\\nAfter another decade-long hiatus, Brackett returned to science fiction in the 1970s with the publication of The Ginger Star (1974), The Hounds of Skaith (1974), and The Reavers of Skaith (1976), collected as The Book of Skaith in 1976. This trilogy brought Eric John Stark back for adventures on the extra-solar planet of Skaith (rather than his old haunts, Mars and Venus).\\nOften called the \"Queen of Space Opera\", Brackett also wrote planetary romance. Almost all her planetary romances take place in the solar system, which contains richly detailed fictional versions of the consensus Mars and Venus of science fiction from the 1930s to the 1950s. Mars appears as a marginally habitable desert world, populated by ancient, decadent and mostly humanoid races, and Venus as a primitive, wet jungle planet, occupied by vigorous, primitive tribes and reptilian monsters. Brackett\\'s Skaith combines elements of her other worlds with fantasy elements.[citation needed]\\nThough Edgar Rice Burroughs\\' influence is apparent in Brackett\\'s Mars stories,[7] her Mars is set firmly in a world of interplanetary commerce and competition. A prominent theme of her stories is the clash of planetary civilizations; they illustrate and criticize the effects of colonialism on civilizations that are either older or younger than those of the colonizers. Burroughs\\' heroes set out to remake entire worlds according to their own codes; Brackett\\'s heroes (often antiheroes) are at the mercy of trends and movements far bigger than they are.[8]\\nAfter the Mariner missions indicated there was no life on Mars, Brackett never returned to her solar system. When she started to write planetary romance again in the 1970s, she invented a new solar system outside our own.[2]\\nShortly after Brackett broke into science fiction writing, she wrote her first screenplays. Hollywood director Howard Hawks was so impressed by her novel No Good from a Corpse that he had his secretary call in \"this guy Brackett\" to help William Faulkner write the script for The Big Sleep (1946).[9] The film was written by Brackett, Faulkner, and Jules Furthman, and starred Humphrey Bogart.\\nAfter getting married, Brackett took a break from screenwriting. When she returned to screenwriting in the mid-1950s, she wrote for TV and movies. Howard Hawks hired her to write or co-write several John Wayne pictures, including Rio Bravo (1959), Hatari! (1962), El Dorado (1966), and Rio Lobo (1970). Because of her background with The Big Sleep, she later adapted Raymond Chandler\\'s novel The Long Goodbye for the screen.[1]\\nBrackett worked on the screenplay for The Empire Strikes Back, the first Star Wars sequel. The film won the Hugo Award in 1981. This script was a departure for Brackett; until then, all her science fiction had been in the form of novels and short stories. George Lucas said that he asked Brackett to write the screenplay based on his story outline. Brackett wrote a finished first draft, titled \"Star Wars sequel\", that was delivered to Lucas shortly before her death from cancer on March 18, 1978, but her version was rejected and Lucas wrote two drafts of a new screenplay and, following the delivery of the screenplay for Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned them over to Lawrence Kasdan to rework some dialogue.[10][11] Brackett and Kasdan (but not Lucas) were credited for the final screenplay. Brackett was credited in tribute despite not being involved in the final film.\\nLaurent Bouzereau, in Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays, said that Lucas disliked the direction of Brackett\\'s screenplay, discarded it, and produced two more screenplays before turning the results over to Kasdan.[12] io9\\'s co-founder Charlie Jane Anders has written that while \"It\\'s fashionable to disparage Brackett\\'s contributions to Empire\", \"it\\'s not true that none of Brackett\\'s storyline winds up in the final movie—the basic story beats are the same.\"[13]\\nFor over 30 years, Brackett\\'s screenplay could be read only at the Jack Williamson Special Collections library at Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, New Mexico, and at Lucasfilm\\'s archives in California. It was officially published in February 2016.[14] In this draft, there is a love triangle between Luke, Leia and Han Solo. Yoda is named Minch, Luke has a hidden sister named Nellith, Lando Calrissian is Lando Kaddar, Luke\\'s father is still a distinct character from Darth Vader and appears as a Force ghost on Dagobah, and Han Solo, at the end of the script, leaves to search for his uncle Ovan Marek, the most powerful man in the universe after the Emperor Palpatine.\\nJohn Saavedra of Den of Geek website wrote:\\nMost importantly, you see that Brackett\\'s draft, while definitely in need of a rewrite and several tweaks, holds all of the big moments we\\'d eventually see on screen. We still get a version of the Battle of Hoth (a much more ridiculous one), the wise words of an old Jedi Master, the excitement of zooming through a deadly asteroid field, a love triangle (a MUCH more overt one), a majestic city in the clouds, unexpected betrayals, and the climactic duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader that we would reenact on playgrounds for years to come.[15]On December 31, 1946, at age 31, Brackett married another science fiction writer, Edmond Hamilton,[2] in San Gabriel, California. Fellow LASFS member Ray Bradbury served as best man.[1][2] Bradbury and Robert Heinlein were longtime close friends of Brackett\\'s.[1] She moved with Hamilton to Kinsman, Ohio.\\nEdmond Hamilton died in February 1977 in Lancaster, California, of complications following kidney surgery. Brackett died there in March 1978, of cancer, at age 62.[15][16]\\n',\n",

He spent much time in the public library reading the three-volume History of the Expedition under the Command of Captains Lewis and Clark which saw him develop an interest in the American West. He also discovered the works of Sherwood Anderson and John Dos Passos, and later William Faulkner and Joseph Conrad. He cited these authors as those most influential on his own work.[1]\\nWhile attending home games by the baseball team the Arkansas Travelers, he became acquainted with Chief Yellow Horse, a pitcher. His kindness, and a childhood friendship with a Creek boy, caused Brown to reject the descriptions of Native American peoples as violent and primitive, which dominated American popular culture at the time.\\nHe worked as a printer and reporter in Harrison, Arkansas, and decided to continue his education at Arkansas State Teachers College in Conway, Arkansas. His mentor, the history professor Dean D. McBrien, helped give him the idea to become a writer. They traveled west along with other students on two occasions in a Model T Ford. On campus, Brown worked as an editor to the student newspaper and was a student assistant in the library. The latter convinced him that he should become a librarian.\\nIn the midst of the Great Depression he went to George Washington University in Washington, D.C. for graduate study. Brown worked part-time for J. Willard Marriott, attended classes, and married Sally Stroud (another graduate of Arkansas State Teachers College drawn to Washington by the New Deal). Eventually he found a full-time job and became a librarian for the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1934 to 1942. He lived at 1717 R Street NW, in the Dupont Circle neighborhood.[2]\\nBrown\\'s first novel was a satire of New Deal bureaucracy, but it was not published, owing to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The publisher suggested \"something patriotic\" instead. He responded with Wave High The Banner, a fictionalized account of the life of Davy Crockett (who was an acquaintance of his great-grandfather). A few months after its publication, he was drafted into the U.S. Army where he met Martin Schmitt, with whom he collaborated on several works after the war. During the war, Brown worked for the United States Department of War as a librarian and never went overseas.\\nFrom 1948 to 1972, he was an agriculture librarian at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he had gained a master\\'s degree in library science, became a professor, and raised a son, Mitchell, and daughter, Linda, with his wife Sally.\\nAs a part-time writer, he published nine books, three fiction and six nonfiction, by the end of the 1950s. During the 1960s, he completed eight more including The Galvanized Yankees, which Brown described as requiring more research than any of his other books, and The Year of the Century: 1876, which he described as his personal favorite.\\nDuring 1971, his book Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee became a best-seller. Many readers assumed that Brown was of Native American heritage.[3]\\nDuring 1973, Brown and his wife retired in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he devoted his time to writing. His later works include Creek Mary\\'s Blood, a novel telling of several generations of a family descended from one Creek woman, and Hear That Lonesome Whistle Blow, which described the chicanery and romance concerning the construction of the western railroads. His last book-length work, The Way To Bright Star, is a picaresque novel set during the Civil War. He never completed its sequel, which was to feature P. T. Barnum and Abraham Lincoln.\\nBrown died at the age of 94 in Little Rock, Arkansas.[4][5] His remains are interred in Urbana, Illinois, along with those of his wife.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nJohn Anthony Burgess Wilson, FRSL (/ˈbɜːrdʒəs/;[2] 25 February 1917\\xa0– 22 November 1993) who published under the name Anthony Burgess, was an English writer and composer.\\nAlthough Burgess was primarily a comic writer, his dystopian satire A Clockwork Orange remains his best-known novel.[3] In 1971, it was adapted into a controversial film by Stanley Kubrick, which Burgess said was chiefly responsible for the popularity of the book. Burgess produced numerous other novels, including the Enderby quartet, and Earthly Powers. He wrote librettos and screenplays, including the 1977 television mini-series Jesus of Nazareth. He worked as a literary critic for several publications, including The Observer and The Guardian, and wrote studies of classic writers, notably James Joyce. A versatile linguist, Burgess lectured in phonetics, and translated Cyrano de Bergerac, Oedipus Rex, and the opera Carmen, among others. Burgess was nominated and shortlisted for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973.[4][5]\\nBurgess also composed over 250 musical works; he considered himself as much a composer as an author, although he achieved considerably more success in writing.[6]\\nIn 1917, Burgess was born at 91 Carisbrook Street in Harpurhey, a suburb of Manchester, England, to Catholic parents, Joseph and Elizabeth Wilson.[7] He described his background as lower middle class; growing up during the Great Depression, his parents, who were shopkeepers, were fairly well off, as the demand for their tobacco and alcohol wares remained constant. He was known in childhood as Jack, Little Jack, and Johnny Eagle.[8] At his confirmation, the name Anthony was added and he became John Anthony Burgess Wilson. He began using the pen name Anthony Burgess upon the publication of his 1956 novel Time for a Tiger.[7]\\nHis mother Elizabeth (née Burgess) died at the age of 30 at home on 19 November 1918, during the 1918 flu pandemic. The causes listed on her death certificate were influenza, acute pneumonia, and cardiac failure. His sister Muriel had died four days earlier on 15 November from influenza, broncho-pneumonia, and cardiac failure, aged eight.[9] Burgess believed he was resented by his father, Joseph Wilson, for having survived, when his mother and sister did not.[10]\\nAfter the death of his mother, Burgess was raised by his maternal aunt, Ann Bromley, in Crumpsall with her two daughters. During this time, Burgess\\'s father worked as a bookkeeper for a beef market by day, and in the evening played piano at a public house in Miles Platting.[8] After his father married the landlady of this pub, Margaret Dwyer, in 1922, Burgess was raised by his father and stepmother.[11] By 1924 the couple had established a tobacconist and off-licence business with four properties.[12] Burgess was briefly employed at the tobacconist shop as a child.[13] On 18 April 1938, Joseph Wilson died from cardiac failure, pleurisy, and influenza at the age of 55, leaving no inheritance despite his apparent business success.[14] Burgess\\'s stepmother died of a heart attack in 1940.[15]\\nBurgess has said of his largely solitary childhood \"I was either distractedly persecuted or ignored. I was one despised.\\xa0... Ragged boys in gangs would pounce on the well-dressed like myself.\"[16] Burgess attended St. Edmund\\'s Elementary School, before moving on to Bishop Bilsborrow Memorial Elementary School, both Catholic schools, in Moss Side.[17] He later reflected \"When I went to school I was able to read. At the Manchester elementary school I attended, most of the children could not read, so I was\\xa0... a little apart, rather different from the rest.\"[18] Good grades resulted in a place at Xaverian College (1928–37).[7]\\nBurgess was indifferent to music until he heard on his home-built radio \"a quite incredible flute solo\", which he characterised as \"sinuous, exotic, erotic\", and became spellbound.[19] Eight minutes later the announcer told him he had been listening to Prélude à l\\'après-midi d\\'un faune by Claude Debussy. He referred to this as a \"psychedelic moment\\xa0... a recognition of verbally inexpressible spiritual realities\".[19] When Burgess announced to his family that he wanted to be a composer, they objected as \"there was no money in it\".[19] Music was not taught at his school, but at the age of about 14 he taught himself to play the piano.[20]\\nBurgess had originally hoped to study music at university, but the music department at the Victoria University of Manchester turned down his application because of poor grades in physics.[21] Instead, he studied English language and literature there between 1937 and 1940, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts. His thesis concerned Marlowe\\'s Doctor Faustus, and he graduated with an upper second-class honours, which he found disappointing.[22] When grading one of Burgess\\'s term papers, the historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: \"Bright ideas insufficient to conceal lack of knowledge.\"[23]\\nBurgess met Llewela \"Lynne\" Isherwood Jones at the university where she was studying economics, politics and modern history, graduating in 1942 with an upper second-class.[24] Burgess and Jones were married on 22 January 1942.[7] She was the daughter of secondary school headmaster Edward Jones (1886–1963) and Florence (née Jones; 1867–1956), and reportedly claimed to be a distant relative of Christopher Isherwood, although the Lewis and Biswell biographies dispute this.[25] According to Burgess\\'s own account, it was not from his wife that the alleged connection to Christopher Isherwood originated: \"Her father was an English Jones, her mother a Welsh one. [...] Of Christopher Isherwood [...] neither the Jones father or daughter had heard. She was unliterary\\xa0...\"[26] Biswell identifies Burgess as the origin of the alleged relationship with Christopher Isherwood—\"if the rumour of an Isherwood affiliation signifies anything, it is that Burgess wanted people to believe that he was connected by marriage to another famous writer\"—and notes that \"Llewela was not, as Burgess claims in his autobiography, a \\'cousin\\' of the writer Christopher Isherwood\"; referring to a pedigree owned by the family, Biswell observes that \"Llewela\\'s father was descended from a female Isherwood\"\\xa0... \"which means going back four generations\\xa0... before encountering any Isherwoods\", making any connection \"at best\" \"tenuous and distant\". He also establishes that per official records, \"Llewela\\'s family name was Jones, not (as Burgess liked to suggest) \\'Isherwood Jones\\' or \\'Isherwood-Jones\\'.\"[27]\\nBurgess spent six weeks in 1940 as a British Army recruit in Eskbank before becoming a Nursing Orderly Class 3 in the Royal Army Medical Corps. During his service, he was unpopular and was involved in incidents such as knocking off a corporal\\'s cap and polishing the floor of a corridor to make people slip.[28] In 1941, Burgess was pursued by the Royal Military Police for desertion after overstaying his leave from Morpeth military base with his future bride Lynne. The following year he asked to be transferred to the Army Educational Corps and, despite his loathing of authority, he was promoted to sergeant.[29] During the blackout, his pregnant wife Lynne was raped and assaulted by four American deserters; perhaps as a result, she lost the child.[7][30] Burgess, stationed at the time in Gibraltar, was denied leave to see her.[31]\\nAt his stationing in Gibraltar, which he later wrote about in A Vision of Battlements, he worked as a training college lecturer in speech and drama, teaching alongside Ann McGlinn in German, French and Spanish.[citation needed] McGlinn\\'s communist ideology would have a major influence on his later novel A Clockwork Orange. Burgess played a key role in \"The British Way and Purpose\" programme, designed to introduce members of the forces to the peacetime socialism of the post-war years in Britain.[32] He was an instructor for the Central Advisory Council for Forces Education of the Ministry of Education.[7] Burgess\\'s flair for languages was noticed by army intelligence, and he took part in debriefings of Dutch expatriates and Free French who found refuge in Gibraltar during the war. In the neighbouring Spanish town of La Línea de la Concepción, he was arrested for insulting General Franco but released from custody shortly after the incident.[33]\\nBurgess left the army in 1946 with the rank of sergeant-major. For the next four years he was a lecturer in speech and drama at the Mid-West School of Education near Wolverhampton and at the Bamber Bridge Emergency Teacher Training College near Preston.[7] Burgess taught in the extramural department of Birmingham University (1946–50).[34]\\nIn late 1950, he began working as a secondary school teacher at Banbury Grammar School (now Banbury School) teaching English literature. In addition to his teaching duties, he supervised sports and ran the school\\'s drama society. He organised a number of amateur theatrical events in his spare time. These involved local people and students and included productions of T. S. Eliot\\'s Sweeney Agonistes.[35] Reports from his former students and colleagues indicate that he cared deeply about teaching.[36]\\nWith financial assistance provided by Lynne\\'s father, the couple was able to put a down payment on a cottage in the village of Adderbury, close to Banbury. He named the cottage \"Little Gidding\" after one of Eliot\\'s Four Quartets. Burgess cut his journalistic teeth in Adderbury, writing several articles for the local newspaper, the Banbury Guardian.[37][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\nIn 1954, Burgess joined the British Colonial Service as a teacher and education officer in Malaya, initially stationed at Kuala Kangsar in Perak. Here he taught at the Malay College (now Malay College Kuala Kangsar – MCKK), modelled on English public school lines. In addition to his teaching duties, he was a housemaster in charge of students of the preparatory school, who were housed at a Victorian mansion known as \"King\\'s Pavilion\".[38][39] A variety of the music he wrote there was influenced by the country, notably Sinfoni Melayu for orchestra and brass band, which included cries of Merdeka (independence) from the audience. No score, however, is extant.[40]\\nBurgess and his wife had occupied a noisy apartment where privacy was minimal, and this caused resentment. Following a dispute with the Malay College\\'s principal about this, Burgess was reposted to the Malay Teachers\\' Training College at Kota Bharu, Kelantan.[41] Burgess attained fluency in Malay, spoken and written, achieving distinction in the examinations in the language set by the Colonial Office. He was rewarded with a salary increase for his proficiency in the language.\\nHe devoted some of his free time in Malaya to creative writing \"as a sort of gentlemanly hobby, because I knew there wasn\\'t any money in it,\" and published his first novels: Time for a Tiger, The Enemy in the Blanket and Beds in the East.[42] These became known as The Malayan Trilogy and were later published in one volume as The Long Day Wanes.\\nAfter a brief period of leave in Britain during 1958, Burgess took up a further Eastern post, this time at the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien College in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. Brunei had been a British protectorate since 1888, and was not to achieve independence until 1984. In the sultanate, Burgess sketched the novel that, when it was published in 1961, was to be entitled Devil of a State and, although it dealt with Brunei, for libel reasons the action had to be transposed to an imaginary East African territory similar to Zanzibar, named Dunia. In his autobiography Little Wilson and Big God (1987), Burgess wrote:[43]\\nThis novel was, is, about Brunei, which was renamed Naraka, Malay-Sanskrit for \"hell\". Little invention was needed to contrive a large cast of unbelievable characters and a number of interwoven plots. Though completed in 1958, the work was not published until 1961, for what it was worth it was made a choice of the book society. Heinemann, my publisher, was doubtful about publishing it: it might be libellous. I had to change the setting from Brunei to an East African one. Heinemann was right to be timorous. In early 1958, The Enemy in the Blanket appeared and at once provoked a libel suit.\\nAbout this time, Burgess collapsed in a Brunei classroom while teaching history and was diagnosed as having an inoperable brain tumour.[21] Burgess was given just a year to live, prompting him to write several novels to get money to provide for his widow.[21] He gave a different account, however, to Jeremy Isaacs in a Face to Face interview on the BBC The Late Show (21 March 1989). He said \"Looking back now I see that I was driven out of the Colonial Service. I think possibly for political reasons that were disguised as clinical reasons\".[44] He alluded to this in an interview with Don Swaim, explaining that his wife Lynne had said something \"obscene\" to the Duke of Edinburgh during an official visit, and the colonial authorities turned against him.[45][46] He had already earned their displeasure, he told Swaim, by writing articles in the newspaper in support of the revolutionary opposition party the Parti Rakyat Brunei, and for his friendship with its leader Dr. Azahari.[45][46] Burgess\\'s biographers attribute the incident to the author\\'s notorious mythomania. Geoffrey Grigson writes:[37]\\nHe was, however, suffering from the effects of prolonged heavy drinking (and associated poor nutrition), of the often oppressive south-east Asian climate, of chronic constipation, and of overwork and professional disappointment. As he put it, the scions of the sultans and of the élite in Brunei \"did not wish to be taught\", because the free-flowing abundance of oil guaranteed their income and privileged status. He may also have wished for a pretext to abandon teaching and get going full-time as a writer, having made a late start.\\nBurgess was invalided home in 1959[47] and relieved of his position in Brunei. He spent some time in the neurological ward of a London hospital (see The Doctor is Sick) where he underwent cerebral tests that found no illness. On discharge, benefiting from a sum of money which Lynne Burgess had inherited from her father, together with their savings built up over six years in the East, he decided to become a full-time writer. The couple lived first in an apartment in Hove, near Brighton. They later moved to a semi-detached house called \"Applegarth\" in Etchingham, about four miles from Bateman\\'s where Rudyard Kipling had lived in Burwash, and one mile from the Robertsbridge home of Malcolm Muggeridge.[48] Upon the death of Burgess\\'s father-in-law, the couple used their inheritance to decamp to a terraced town house in Chiswick. This provided convenient access to the BBC Television Centre where he later became a frequent guest. During these years Burgess became a regular drinking partner of the novelist William S. Burroughs. Their meetings took place in London and Tangiers.[49]\\nA sea voyage the couple took with the Baltic Line from Tilbury to Leningrad in June 1961[50] resulted in the novel Honey for the Bears. He wrote in his autobiographical You\\'ve Had Your Time (1990), that in re-learning Russian at this time, he found inspiration for the Russian-based slang Nadsat that he created for A Clockwork Orange, going on to note, \"I would resist to the limit any publisher\\'s demand that a glossary be provided.\"[51][Notes 1]\\nLiana Macellari, an Italian translator twelve years younger than Burgess, came across his novels Inside Mr. Enderby and A Clockwork Orange, while writing about English fiction.[52] The two first met in 1963 over lunch in Chiswick and began an affair. In 1964, Liana gave birth to Burgess\\'s son, Paolo Andrea. The affair was hidden from Burgess\\'s alcoholic wife, whom he refused to leave for fear of offending his cousin (by Burgess\\'s stepmother, Margaret Dwyer Wilson), George Dwyer, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds.[52]\\nLynne Burgess died from cirrhosis of the liver, on 20 March 1968.[7] Six months later, in September 1968, Burgess married Liana, acknowledging her four-year-old boy as his own, although the birth certificate listed Roy Halliday, Liana\\'s former partner, as the father.[52] Paolo Andrea (also known as Andrew Burgess Wilson) died in London in 2002, aged 37.[53] Liana died in 2007.[52]\\nBurgess was a Conservative (though, as he clarified in an interview with The Paris Review, his political views could be considered \"a kind of anarchism\" since his ideal of a \"Catholic Jacobite imperial monarch\" was not practicable) a (lapsed) Catholic and monarchist, harbouring a distaste for all republics.[54] He believed socialism for the most part was \"ridiculous\" but did \"concede that socialised medicine is a priority in any civilised country today\".[54] To avoid the 90% tax the family would have incurred because of their high income, they left Britain and toured Europe in a Bedford Dormobile motor-home. During their travels through France and across the Alps, Burgess wrote in the back of the van as Liana drove.\\nIn this period, he wrote novels and produced film scripts for Lew Grade and Franco Zeffirelli.[52] His first place of residence after leaving England was Lija, Malta (1968–70). The negative reaction from a lecture that Burgess delivered to an audience of Catholic priests in Malta precipitated a move by the couple to Italy[52] after the Maltese government confiscated the property.[13] (He would go on to fictionalise these events in Earthly Powers a decade later.[13]) The Burgesses maintained a flat in Rome, a country house in Bracciano, and a property in Montalbuccio. On hearing rumours of a mafia plot to kidnap Paolo Andrea while the family was staying in Rome, Burgess decided to move to Monaco in 1975.[55] Burgess was also motivated to move to the tax haven of Monaco, as the country did not levy income tax, and widows were exempt from death duties, a form of taxation on their husband\\'s estates.[56] The couple also had a villa in France, at Callian, Var, Provence.[57]\\nBurgess lived for a number of years in the United States, working as writer-in-residence at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1969, as a visiting professor at Princeton University with the creative writing program in 1970, and as a distinguished professor at the City College of New York in 1972. At City College he was a close colleague and friend of Joseph Heller. He went on to teach creative writing at Columbia University, lectured on the novel at the University of Iowa in 1975, and was and at the University at Buffalo in 1976.  Eventually he settled in Monaco in 1976, where he was active in the local community, becoming a co-founder of the Princess Grace Irish Library, a centre for Irish cultural studies, in 1984.\\nIn May 1988, Burgess made an extended appearance with, among others, Andrea Dworkin on the episode What Is Sex For? of the discussion programme After Dark. He spoke at one point about divorce:\\nLiking involves no discipline; love does\\xa0... A marriage, say that lasts twenty years or more, is a kind of civilisation, a kind of microcosm – it develops its own language, its own semiotics, its own slang, its own shorthand\\xa0... sex is part of it, part of the semiotics. To destroy, wantonly, such a relationship, is like destroying a whole civilisation.[58]Although Burgess lived not far from Graham Greene, whose house was in Antibes, Greene became aggrieved shortly before his death by comments in newspaper articles by Burgess and broke off all contact.[37] Gore Vidal revealed in his 2006 memoir Point to Point Navigation that Greene disapproved of Burgess\\'s appearance on various European television stations to discuss his (Burgess\\'s) books.[37] Vidal recounts that Greene apparently regarded a willingness to appear on television as something that ought to be beneath a writer\\'s dignity.[37] \"He talks about his books,\" Vidal quotes an exasperated Greene as saying.[37] During this time, Burgess spent much time at his chalet 2\\xa0km (1.2\\xa0mi) outside Lugano, Switzerland.\\nAlthough Burgess wrote that he expected to \"die somewhere in the Mediterranean lands, with an inaccurate obituary in the Nice-Matin, unmourned, soon forgotten\",[59] he returned to die in Twickenham, an outer suburb of London, where he owned a house. Burgess died on 22\\xa0November 1993 from lung cancer, at the Hospital of St\\xa0John & St\\xa0Elizabeth in London. His ashes were inurned at the Monaco Cemetery.\\nThe epitaph on Burgess\\'s marble memorial stone, reads: \"Abba Abba\", which means \"Father, father\" in Aramaic, Arabic, Hebrew, and other Semitic languages and is pronounced by Christ during his agony in Gethsemane (Mark 14:36) as he prays God to spare him. It is also the title of Burgess\\'s 22nd novel, concerning the death of John Keats. Eulogies at his memorial service at St\\xa0Paul\\'s, Covent Garden, London, in 1994 were delivered by the journalist Auberon Waugh and the novelist William Boyd.[citation needed] The Times obituary heralded the author as \"a great moralist\".[60] His estate was worth US$3\\xa0million and included a large European property portfolio of houses and apartments.[52]\\nHis Malayan trilogy The Long Day Wanes was Burgess\\'s first published fiction. Its three books are Time for a Tiger, The Enemy in the Blanket and Beds in the East. Devil of a State is a follow-on to the trilogy, set in a fictionalised version of Brunei. It was Burgess\\'s ambition to become \"the true fictional expert on Malaya\".[citation needed] In these works, Burgess was working in the tradition established by Kipling for British India, and Conrad and Maugham for Southeast Asia. Burgess operated more in the mode of Orwell, who had a good command of Urdu and Burmese (necessary for Orwell\\'s work as a police officer) and Kipling, who spoke Hindi (having learnt it as a child). Like many of his fellow English expatriates in Asia, Burgess had excellent spoken and written command of his operative language(s), both as a novelist and as a speaker, including Malay.\\nBurgess\\'s repatriate years (c.\\u20091960–1969) produced Enderby and The Right to an Answer, which touches on the theme of death and dying, and One Hand Clapping, a satire on the vacuity of popular culture. The Worm and the Ring (1961) had to be withdrawn from circulation under the threat of libel action from one of Burgess\\'s former colleagues, a school secretary.[61]\\nHis dystopian novel, A Clockwork Orange, was published in 1962. It was inspired initially by an incident during the London Blitz of World War II in which his wife Lynne was robbed, assaulted, and violated by deserters from the US Army in London during the blackout. The event may have contributed to her subsequent miscarriage. The book was an examination of free will and morality. The young anti-hero, Alex, captured after a short career of violence and mayhem, undergoes a course of aversion therapy treatment to curb his violent tendencies. This results in making him defenceless against other people and unable to enjoy some of his favourite music that, besides violence, had been an intense pleasure for him. In the non-fiction book Flame into Being (1985), Burgess described A Clockwork Orange as \"a jeu d\\'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks. It became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence\". He added, \"the film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me till I die\". In a 1980 BBC interview, Burgess distanced himself from the novel and cinematic adaptations. Near the time of publication, the final chapter was cut from the American edition of the book.[citation needed]\\nBurgess had written A Clockwork Orange with 21 chapters, meaning to match the age of majority. \"21 is the symbol of human maturity, or used to be, since at 21 you got to vote and assumed adult responsibility\", Burgess wrote in a foreword for a 1986 edition. Needing money and thinking that the publisher was \"being charitable in accepting the work at all,\" Burgess accepted the deal and allowed A Clockwork Orange to be published in the US with the twenty-first chapter omitted. Stanley Kubrick\\'s film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange was based on the American edition, and thus helped to perpetuate the loss of the last chapter. In 2021, The International Anthony Burgess Foundation premiered a webpage cataloguing various stage productions of \"A Clockwork Orange\" from around the world.[62]\\nIn Martin Seymour-Smith\\'s Novels and Novelists: A Guide to the World of Fiction, Burgess related that he would often prepare a synopsis with a name-list before beginning a project. Seymour-Smith wrote:[63]\\nBurgess believes overplanning is fatal to creativity and regards his unconscious mind and the act of writing itself as indispensable guides. He does not produce a draft of a whole novel but prefers to get one page finished before he goes on to the next, which involves a good deal of revision and correction.\\nNothing Like the Sun is a fictional recreation of Shakespeare\\'s love-life and an examination of the supposedly partly syphilitic sources of the bard\\'s imaginative vision. The novel, which drew on Edgar I.\\xa0Fripp\\'s 1938 biography Shakespeare, Man and Artist, won critical acclaim and placed Burgess among the first rank novelists of his generation. M/F (1971) was listed by the writer himself as one of the works of which he was most proud. Beard\\'s Roman Women was revealing on a personal level, dealing with the death of his first wife, his bereavement, and the affair that led to his second marriage. In Napoleon Symphony, Burgess brought Bonaparte to life by shaping the novel\\'s structure to Beethoven\\'s Eroica symphony. The novel contains a portrait of an Arab and Muslim society under occupation by a Christian western power (Egypt by Catholic France). In the 1980s, religious themes began to feature heavily (The Kingdom of the Wicked, Man of Nazareth, Earthly Powers). Though Burgess lapsed from Catholicism early in his youth, the influence of the Catholic \"training\" and worldview remained strong in his work all his life. This is notable in the discussion of free will in A Clockwork Orange, and in the apocalyptic vision of devastating changes in the Catholic Church\\xa0– due to what can be understood as Satanic influence\\xa0– in Earthly Powers (1980).\\nBurgess kept working through his final illness and was writing on his deathbed. The late novel Any Old Iron is a generational saga of two families, one Russian-Welsh, the other Jewish, encompassing the sinking of the Titanic, World War\\xa0I, the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, World War\\xa0II, the early years of the State of Israel, and the rediscovery of Excalibur. A Dead Man in Deptford, about Christopher Marlowe, is a companion novel to Nothing Like the Sun. The verse novel Byrne was published posthumously.\\nBurgess announced in a 1972 interview that he was writing a novel about the Black Prince which incorporated John Dos Passos\\'s narrative techniques, although he never finished writing it.[54] After Burgess\\'s death, English writer Adam Roberts completed the novel, and it was published in 2018 under the title The Black Prince.[64] In 2019, a previously unpublished analysis of A Clockwork Orange was discovered titled, \"The Clockwork Condition\".[65] It is structured as Burgess\\'s philosophical musings on the novel that won him so much acclaim.\\nBurgess started his career as a critic. His English Literature, A Survey for Students was aimed at newcomers to the subject. He followed this with The Novel To-day (Longmans, 1963) and The Novel Now: A Student\\'s Guide to Contemporary Fiction (New York: W.\\xa0W. Norton and Company, 1967). He wrote the Joyce studies Here Comes Everybody: An Introduction to James Joyce for the Ordinary Reader (also published as Re Joyce) and Joysprick: An Introduction to the Language of James Joyce. Also published was A Shorter \"Finnegans Wake\", Burgess\\'s abridgement. His 1970 Encyclopædia Britannica entry on the novel (under \"Novel, the\"[66]) is regarded[by whom?] as a classic of the genre. Burgess wrote full-length critical studies of William Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway and D.\\xa0H. Lawrence, as well as Ninety-nine Novels: The Best in English since 1939.[67]\\nBurgess wrote the screenplays for Moses the Lawgiver (Gianfranco De Bosio 1974), Jesus of Nazareth (Franco Zeffirelli 1977), and A.D. (Stuart Cooper, 1985). Burgess was co-writer of the script for the TV series Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson (1980). The film treatments he produced include Amundsen, Attila, The Black Prince, Cyrus the Great, Dawn Chorus, The Dirty Tricks of Bertoldo, Eternal Life, Onassis, Puma, Samson and Delilah, Schreber, The Sexual Habits of the English Middle Class, Shah, That Man Freud and Uncle Ludwig. Burgess devised a Stone Age language for La Guerre du Feu (Quest for Fire; Jean-Jacques Annaud, 1981).\\nBurgess wrote many unpublished scripts, including Will! or The Bawdy Bard about Shakespeare, based on the novel Nothing Like The Sun. Encouraged by the success of Tremor of Intent (a parody of James Bond adventures), Burgess wrote a screenplay for The Spy Who Loved Me featuring characters from and a similar tone to the novel.[68] It had Bond fighting the criminal organisation CHAOS in Singapore to try to stop an assassination of Queen Elizabeth\\xa0II using surgically implanted bombs at Sydney Opera House. It was described as \"an outrageous medley of sadism, hypnosis, acupuncture, and international terrorism\".[69] His screenplay was rejected, although the huge submarine silo seen in the finished film was reportedly Burgess\\'s inspiration.[70]\\nAnthony Burgess\\'s involvement with theatre started while attending university in Manchester, where directed plays and wrote theatre reviews. In Oxfordshire he was an active member of the Adderbury Drama Group, where he directed multiple plays, including Juno and the Paycock by Sean O\\'Casey, A Phoenix Too Frequent by Christopher Fry, The Giaconda Smile by Aldous Huxley and The Adding Machine by Elmer Rice.[71]\\nHe wrote his first play in 1951, called The Eve of Saint Venus. There are no records of the play being performed, and in 1964 he turned the text into a novella. Throughout his life he wrote multiple adaptations and translations for theatre. His most famous work A Clockwork Orange, he adapted for the stage under the title A Clockwork Orange: A Play With Music. According to The International Anthony Burgess Foundation it had the following performances; an expanded edition of this play, with a facsimile of the handwritten score, appeared in 1999; A Clockwork Orange 2004, adapted from Burgess\\'s novel by the director Ron Daniels and published by Arrow Books, was produced at the Barbican Theatre in London in 1990, with music by The Edge from U2.[71] \\xa0\\nHis other famous translations include the English version of Cyrano de Bergerac by Edmond Rostand. Recently two of his until now unpublished translations were published by Salamander Street, and imprint of Wordville, which the Foundation called a \\'significant literary discovery\\'.[72] One is Miser! Miser! A translation of Molière\\'s The Miser. Although the original French play is written in prose, Burgess remakes it in a mixture of verse and prose, in the style of his famous adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac.[73] The other Chatsky subtitled \\'The Importance of Being Stupid\\' based on Woe from Wit by Alexander Griboyedov. In Chatsky, Burgess remakes a classic Russian play in the spirit of Oscar Wilde.[73]\\nAn accomplished musician, Burgess composed regularly throughout his life, and once said: \"I wish people would think of me as a musician who writes novels, instead of a novelist who writes music on the side.\"[74] He wrote more than 250 compositions in a variety of forms, including symphonies, concertos, chamber music, piano music, and works for the theatre.[6]  His early introduction to music is lightly disguised as fiction in his novel The Pianoplayers (1986). Many of his unpublished compositions are listed in This Man and Music (1982).[6]\\nHe began composing seriously while in the army during the war, and then while working as a teacher in Malaya, but could not earn a living from it. His early symphony, Sinfoni Melayu (now lost), was an attempt \"to combine the musical elements of the country [Malaya] into a synthetic language which called on native drums and xylophones\".[75] A second symphony has also been lost. But his Symphony No 3 in C was commissioned by the University of Iowa Symphony Orchestra in 1974, resulting in the first public performance of an orchestral work by Burgess – a momentous occasion for the composer which spurred him on to renew his composing activities with other large scale works, including a violin concerto for Yehudi Menuhin which remained unperformed due to the violinist\\'s death.[76] More recently, the Symphony was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 as part of the Manchester International Festival in July 2017.[77]\\nBurgess also wrote a good deal of chamber music. He wrote for the recorder as his son played the instrument. Several works for recorder and piano, including the Sonata No.\\xa01, Sonatina and Tre Pezzetti, have been recorded by John Turner with pianist Harvey Davies.[78] His collected guitar quartets have also been recorded by the Mēla Guitar Quartet.[79]  A recently recovered work is a string quartet from 1980, influenced by Dmitri Shostakovich, which unexpectedly turned up in the archive of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation.[80] For piano, Burgess composed a set of 24 Preludes and Fugues, The Bad-Tempered Electronic Keyboard (1985), which has been recorded by Stephane Ginsburgh.[81]\\nBurgess composed the operetta Blooms of Dublin in 1982, adapting the libretto from James Joyce\\'s Ulysses. It is a very free interpretation of Joyce\\'s text, with changes and interpolations by Burgess himself, all set to original music that blends opera with Gilbert and Sullivan and music hall styles. The musical was televised by the BBC, to mixed reviews.[82] He wrote the libretto for the 1973 Broadway musical Cyrano (music by Michael J. Lewis), using his own adaptation of the original Rostand play as his basis.[83] Burgess also produced a translation of Meilhac and Halévy\\'s libretto to Bizet\\'s Carmen, which was performed by the English National Opera in 1986, and wrote a new libretto for Weber\\'s last opera Oberon (1826), reprinted alongside the original in Oberon Old and New. It was performed by the Glasgow-based Scottish Opera in 1985, but hasn\\'t been revived since.[84]\\nNearly all the writings, fiction and non-fiction, reflect his musical experiences. Biographical elements concerning musicians, particularly failed composers, occur everywhere. His early novel A Vision of Battlements (1965) concerns Richard Ennis, a composer of symphonies and concertos who is serving in the British army in Gibraltar. His last, Byrne (1995), a novel set in verse form, is about a minor modern composer who enjoys greater success in bed than he does in the concert hall. Fictional works mentioned in the novels often parallel Burgess\\'s own real compositions, and provide a commentary on them, such as the cantata St Celia\\'s Day, described in the 1976 novel Beard\\'s Roman Women, which surfaced two years after the novel was published as a real Burgess work.\\nBut the musical influences go far beyond the biographical. There are experiments combining musical forms and literature.[85] Tremor of Intent (1966), the James Bond spoof thriller, is set in sonata form. Mozart and the Wolf Gang (1991) mirrors the sound and rhythm of Mozartian composition, among other things attempting a fictional representation of Symphony No.\\xa040.[86] Napoleon Symphony: A Novel in Four Movements (1974) is a literary interpretation of Beethoven\\'s Eroica, while Beethoven\\'s Symphony No. 9 features prominently in A Clockwork Orange (and in Stanley Kubrick\\'s film version of the novel).\\nHis use of language often highlights sound over meaning – in the made-up, Russian-influenced language \"Nadsat\" used by the narrator of A Clockwork Orange, in the wordless film script Quest for Fire (1981), where he invents a tribal language that prehistoric man might have spoken, and in the non-fiction work on the sound of language, A Mouthful of Air (1992).[87]\\nOn the BBC\\'s Desert Island Discs radio programme in 1966,[88] Burgess chose as his favourite music Purcell\\'s \"Rejoice in the Lord alway\"; Bach\\'s Goldberg Variations No.\\xa013; Elgar\\'s Symphony No.\\xa01 in A-flat major; Wagner\\'s \"Walter\\'s Trial Song\" from Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg; Debussy\\'s \"Fêtes\" from Nocturnes; Lambert\\'s The Rio Grande; Walton\\'s Symphony No.\\xa01 in B-flat minor; and Vaughan Williams\\' On Wenlock Edge. A collection of essays on music by Burgess was published in 2024.[89]\\n\"Burgess\\'s linguistic training\", wrote Raymond Chapman and Tom McArthur in The Oxford Companion to the English Language: \"...\\xa0is shown in dialogue enriched by distinctive pronunciations and the niceties of register\".[90] During his years in Malaya, and after he had mastered Jawi, the Arabic script adapted for Malay, Burgess taught himself the Persian language, after which he produced a translation of Eliot\\'s The Waste Land into Persian (unpublished). He worked on an anthology of the best of English literature translated into Malay, which failed to achieve publication. Burgess\\'s published translations include two versions of Cyrano de Bergerac,[91] Oedipus the King[92] and Carmen.\\nBurgess\\'s interest in language was reflected in the invented, Anglo-Russian teen slang of A Clockwork Orange (Nadsat), and in the movie Quest for Fire (1981), for which he invented a prehistoric language (Ulam) for the characters. His interest is reflected in his characters. In The Doctor is Sick, Dr Edwin Spindrift is a lecturer in linguistics who escapes from a hospital ward which is peopled, as the critic Saul Maloff put it in a review, with \"brain cases who happily exemplify varieties of English speech\". Burgess, who had lectured on phonetics at the University of Birmingham in the late 1940s, investigates the field of linguistics in Language Made Plain and A Mouthful of Air.\\nThe depth of Burgess\\'s multilingual proficiency came under discussion in Roger Lewis\\'s 2002 biography. Lewis claimed that during production in Malaysia of the BBC documentary A Kind of Failure (1982), Burgess\\'s supposedly fluent Malay was not understood by waitresses at a restaurant where they were filming. It was claimed that the documentary\\'s director deliberately kept these moments intact in the film to expose Burgess\\'s linguistic pretensions. A letter from David Wallace that appeared in the magazine of the London Independent on Sunday newspaper on 25\\xa0November 2002 shed light on the affair. Wallace\\'s letter read, in part:\\n...\\xa0the tale was inaccurate. It tells of Burgess, the great linguist, \"bellowing Malay at a succession of Malayan waitresses\" but \"unable to make himself understood\". The source of this tale was a 20-year-old BBC documentary\\xa0... [The suggestion was] that the director left the scene in, in order to poke fun at the great author. Not so, and I can be sure, as I was that director\\xa0... The story as seen on television made it clear that Burgess knew that these waitresses were not Malay. It was a Chinese restaurant and Burgess\\'s point was that the ethnic Chinese had little time for the government-enforced national language, Bahasa Malaysia [Malay]. Burgess may well have had an accent, but he did speak the language; it was the girls in question who did not.\\nLewis may not have been fully aware of the fact that a quarter of Malaysia\\'s population is made up of Hokkien- and Cantonese-speaking Chinese. However, Malay had been installed as the National Language with the passing of the Language Act of 1967. By 1982 all national primary and secondary schools in Malaysia would have been teaching with Bahasa Melayu as a base language (see Harold Crouch, Government and Society in Malaysia, Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1996).\\nThe largest archive of Anthony Burgess\\'s belongings is housed at the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in Manchester, UK. The holdings include: handwritten journals and diaries; over 8000 books from Burgess\\'s personal library; manuscripts of novels, journalism and musical compositions; professional and private photographs dating from between 1918 and 1993; an extensive archive of sound recordings; Burgess\\'s music collection; furniture; musical instruments including two of Burgess\\'s pianos; and correspondence that includes letters from Angela Carter, Graham Greene, Thomas Pynchon and other notable writers and publishers.[93] The International Anthony Burgess Foundation was established by Burgess\\'s widow, Liana, in 2003.\\nBeginning in 1995, Burgess\\'s widow sold a large archive of his papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin with several additions made in subsequent years.[94] Comprising over 136 boxes, the archive includes typed and handwritten manuscripts, sheet music, correspondence, clippings, contracts and legal documents, appointment books, magazines, photographs, and personal effects. \\nA substantial amount of unpublished and unproduced music compositions is included in the collection, along with a small number of audio recordings of Burgess\\'s interviews and performances of his work.[95] Over 90 books from Burgess\\'s library can also be found in the Ransom Center\\'s holdings.[96] In 2014, the Ransom Center added the archive of Burgess\\'s long-time agent Gabriele Pantucci, which also includes substantial manuscripts, sheet music, correspondence, and contracts.[97] Burgess\\'s archive at the Ransom Center is supplemented by significant archives of artists Burgess admired including James Joyce, Graham Greene and D. H. Lawrence.\\nA small collection of papers, musical manuscripts and other items was deposited with the University of Angers in 1998. Its present whereabouts are unclear.[98][99]\\n\\n',\n",

He was notable for his book, The Saga of Billy the Kid (1926).[1]\\nBurns was born on October 24, 1866,[2] in Lebanon, Kentucky. He was the son of Thomas E. Burns (1837–1908), a colonel in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Walter's mother, Mary Crisella Noble (1847–1871), died when he was four years old.[1] He and his father, Thomas E. Burns, were recorded as resident with his mother's parents, Lorenzo H. Noble (1819–1899) and Alice Ann Noble (1823–1899), during the 1870 and 1880 Federal Censuses in Marion Co., Kentucky.  Noble was an attorney from Maine, who had migrated to Kentucky, and became a prominent attorney & judge.[3]  Walter married Rose Marie Hoke on 10 November 1902.[1]\\nWalter Noble Burns served with the 1st Kentucky Infantry during the Spanish–American War in 1898. In 1900, he moved to Chicago, Illinois, and began a career as a journalist, literary critic and crime reporter. After World War I, Burns retired as a reporter, then concentrated his writing about Western American legends.[4]\\nMark J.

He played college football at Auburn, where he became the SEC's all-time leading scorer and was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the fifth round of the 2018 NFL draft. Released by Minnesota during his rookie season, Carlson joined the Raiders and has twice led the league in scoring. He is currently the fourth most accurate kicker in the NFL.[1]\\nCarlson was born on January 23, 1995, to Hans and Jodie Carlson. He has an older brother named Nils and a younger brother named Anders, who played kicker for the Green Bay Packers[2] and currently plays for the New York Jets.[3]\\nCarlson attended The Classical Academy before college.[4]\\nUnder head coach Gus Malzahn, Carlson never missed an extra point in his collegiate career with the Auburn Tigers.[5] He was the all-time leading scorer in Southeastern Conference (SEC) football history with 480 career points until passed by Will Reichard of Alabama in 2023. Carlson was a three time member of the All SEC Team First Team.[6][7]\\nCarlson was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the fifth round (167th overall) of the 2018 NFL draft.[9] He was one of two kickers to be drafted that year, the other being Jason Sanders by the Miami Dolphins.[10]\\nIn the offseason, Carlson competed with veteran kicker Kai Forbath. Carlson won the job, and Forbath was released by the team on August 20, 2018.[11] Carlson made his NFL debut in the season-opening 24–16 victory over the San Francisco 49ers and converted all three extra point attempts and a field goal attempt.[12] In the next game against the Green Bay Packers, he missed a field goal in regulation and two in overtime, resulting in a 29–29 tie.[13] The following day, Carlson was waived and replaced by veteran Dan Bailey.[14]\\nCarlson was signed by the Oakland Raiders on October 23, 2018, after the team released fellow rookie kicker Matt McCrane.[15] In his Raiders' debut in Week 8, Carlson converted all four extra point attempts during a 42–28 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.[16] Three weeks later, Carlson made two extra points and three field goals, including a 35-yard game winner as time expired, in a narrow 23–21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, earning him AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors.[17] Carlson went on to convert 94% of his field goal attempts for the Raiders in 2018, setting a new team record.[18]\\nOn April 16, 2020, Carlson was re-signed to a one-year contract.[19] During the 2020 offseason, Carlson switched his jersey number from 8 to 2 in order to allow quarterback Marcus Mariota to wear number 8.[20] In Week 1 against the Carolina Panthers, Carlson was a perfect 4 for 4 on his extra point and field goal attempts, including a career long 54-yard field goal, during the 34–30 road victory. Carlson was named the AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance in Week 1.[21] Carlson was named the AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for his performance in December.[22]\\nThe Raiders placed a second-round restricted free agent tender on Carlson on March 17, 2021.[23] He signed the tender on April 29.[24] In Week 2, Carlson converted all four field goal attempts and both extra-point attempts in a 26–17 victory over the Steelers, earning AFC Special Teams Player of the Week.[25] On Thanksgiving Day the Dallas Cowboys, he went 3–3 on extra points and 5–5 on field goals in a 36–33 overtime road victory, including a career-long 56-yarder to take a late lead in the 4th quarter and a 29-yarder to win the game in overtime.[26] Carlson's Thanksgiving Day performance earned him another AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honor, a feat only two other kickers had achieved at that point in the season.\\nOn December 9, 2021, Carlson signed a four-year, $18.4 million extension with the Raiders, making him the third highest-paid kicker in the NFL.[27][28]\\nDown the stretch of the 2021 season, Carlson's kicking performance would become crucial for the Raiders.

       "  '\\nDavid Wynford Carnegie (23 March 1871 – 27 November 1900) was an explorer and gold prospector in Western Australia. In 1896 he led an expedition from Coolgardie through the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts to Halls Creek, and then back again.\\nDavid Carnegie was born in London on 23 March 1871, the youngest child of James Carnegie, 9th Earl of Southesk. He was educated at Charterhouse in Godalming, Surrey but dropped out without graduating, and was thereafter educated by a private tutor. He later entered the Royal Indian Engineering College, but again dropped out without completing the course. In 1892, he travelled to Ceylon to work on a tea plantation. Finding it boring, he quit after a few weeks, and set sail for Australia with his friend Lord Percy Douglas.\\nOn arriving in Albany, Western Australia in September 1892, Carnegie and Douglas learned of Arthur Bayley\\'s discovery of gold at Coolgardie, and immediately decided to leave the ship and join the gold rush. Together, they prospected around Coolgardie for a number of months, with little success. Eventually, Douglas left the field to raise finances in order for them to continue prospecting. Carnegie continued prospecting, joining the rush to Kalgoorlie after Paddy Hannan\\'s discovery of gold there. He had little success, and by the middle of 1893 he was destitute. Unable to make a living as a prospector, he took a job at the Bayley\\'s Reward mine in Coolgardie.\\nLate in 1893, Douglas was appointed a director of a new mining exploration company, thus securing finances for Carnegie\\'s prospecting. In March 1894, Carnegie commenced his first prospecting expedition, in the company of a prospector and camel handler named Gus Luck. The pair initially explored the Hampton Plains immediately east of Kalgoorlie, but finding it extremely dry, they travelled instead to Queen Victoria Spring, about 250\\xa0km (160\\xa0mi) east of Kalgoorlie. From there they travelled north through unknown country to Mount Shenton, about 100\\xa0km (62\\xa0mi) north east of the present-day town of Laverton. After prospecting around Mount Margaret and Mount Ida, they returned to Coolgardie, having been away for ninety days and having travelled about 1,350\\xa0km (840\\xa0mi). They had found little evidence of gold, and nothing worth claiming a lease on.\\nIn November 1894, Carnegie set out on his second prospecting expedition, this time in the company of two prospectors: an American named Jim Conley and an Irish-Victorian named Paddy Egan. The party initially travelled north, but hearing rumours of promising country near Lake Roe, they turned to the south east. After meeting no success around Lake Roe, they returned to the north, again exploring around Mount Margaret and Mount Ida. Early in February, after failing to locate a pool at Erlistoun, the party sought water in a granite outcrop near Lake Darlot, about 60\\xa0km (37\\xa0mi) east of the present-day town of Leinster. There, they had the good fortune to stumble upon the scene of a rich new find, before news of the find had reached Coolgardie. Having beaten the rush, Carnegie was able to discover and lay claim to a high quality reef. After working the reef for a period, the company sold the mine, and Carnegie received a substantial sum.\\nCarnegie formed a syndicate with some friends, into which he deposited his camels, then returned to England to visit his family. Finding that his family were disappointed and embarrassed by his lack of an education and career, he returned to Australia determined \"to prove that I am not the useless devil they have prophesied I would become\".[1]\\nWhile he was away, his syndicate had pegged another mine, and shortly after his return it also was sold.\\nCarnegie invested his profits from the two mines in preparations for his major expedition; he proposed to travel almost 1,600\\xa0km (990\\xa0mi) from Coolgardie to Halls Creek. Much of the area through which he intended to travel was unexplored and unmapped, and Carnegie hoped to find good pastoral or gold-bearing land, and to make a name for himself as an explorer.\\nCarnegie\\'s party consisted of five men and nine camels. His travelling companions were the prospectors Charles Stansmore and Godfrey Massie, bushman Joe Breaden, and Breaden\\'s Aboriginal companion Warri. The party left Coolgardie on 9 July 1896. They travelled north to Menzies, then north east. On 23 July they entered largely unexplored country, and were immediately affected by the extreme scarcity of water. By 9 August they were desperately short of water; that day they came upon a native, who they captured and forced to show where water was located. The supply they were led to was an underground spring in a hidden cave, which Carnegie named Empress Spring after Queen Victoria. The party realised they could never have found this on their own. This became the pattern for the remainder of the expedition: whenever short of water, the party tracked down and captured natives, and tried to force them to lead the expedition to water.\\nLeaving the spring, the expedition continued north. Throughout August, September and October, the party passed through the desert country of the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts. At first, the terrain was largely flat, and consisted almost entirely of spinifex and sand (hence the name Spinifex and Sand for Carnegie\\'s published account of the expedition). Later, the flatness of the land was broken up by regular sandridges, running in an east-west direction. Since the party was travelling in a northerly direction, they had to cross these sandridges at right angles, and this made travel even more difficult. Carnegie later wrote of the land:\\n\\nWhat heartbreaking country, monotonous, lifeless, without interest, without excitement save when the stern necessity of finding water forced us to seek out the natives in their primitive camps.[2]Carnegie managed to bring the party almost entirely through the desert without loss. However, on 2 November, with their journey nearing completion, a number of Carnegie\\'s camels ate poisonous plants, and three died. Four weeks later, with the party only eight miles (13\\xa0km) from the Derby–Halls Creek road, Stansmore slipped while crossing a ridge, and dropped his gun. When the gun hit the ground, the cartridge exploded, and Stansmore was shot through the heart. He died instantly, and was buried nearby by his companions. The remaining members of the party reached Halls Creek four days later, after a journey of 149 days and 1,413 miles (2,274\\xa0km).\\nOn arriving at Halls Creek, the party were informed that two members of the Calvert Exploring Expedition were missing in the desert. The Calvert expedition had taken a path roughly parallel to the Carnegie expedition, but about 100 miles (160\\xa0km) further west. Carnegie offered to join the search for the missing men, but despite his familiarity with the search area, he was not sent out immediately, being instead put on standby in Halls Creek. He formulated a search plan, and purchased three horses in anticipation of joining the search, but to the party\\'s great frustration they remained on standby for nearly fifteen weeks. Eventually, it became obvious that the missing men must have perished, and Carnegie retracted his offer of help.\\nCarnegie\\'s expedition was originally intended to terminate at Halls Creek, but since they had found no gold-bearing or pastoral land, the party decided to continue exploring, by returning to Coolgardie by a more easterly overland route. The party left Halls Creek on 22 March 1897, heading east then southeast, before eventually turning south. At first the going was easier than the trip north: water and game were easily found; the natives they encountered were friendly; and the camels\\' loads had been lightened, enabling them to carry a large supply of water. Later, the party experienced similar hardships to their northerly trip, scarcity of water being the main problem. Although they were able to carry plenty of water with them, this advantage was largely cancelled out by the presence of horses in the party, horses needing regular and generous watering. They arrived back in Coolgardie late in August 1897, having again found no land of interest to prospector or pastoralist.\\nShortly after the completion of his expedition, Carnegie sold his assets and sailed for England. In England, he wrote and published a book on his experiences in Western Australia, entitled Spinifex and Sand. He also gave a brief lecture tour, and was awarded a medal by the Royal Geographical Society. However he was keen to resume exploring, and he expressed interest in joining an expedition from Cape Town to Cairo before eventually deciding against it. He also sought funding to lead an expedition to map the country between Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana) in northern Kenya and the Nile, but was unsuccessful.\\nEventually Carnegie accepted a position as Assistant Resident of the Middle Niger in the Protectorate of Nigeria. He sailed for Africa in December 1899, and took up his job in late January 1900. In November 1900, Carnegie was sent to apprehend a fugitive named Gana. While searching the village of Tawari in the early hours of the morning of 27 November 1900, he was shot in the thigh with a poison arrow. He died fifteen minutes later. He was 29 years old.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAsa Earl Carter (September 4, 1925 – June 7, 1979) was a 1950s segregationist political activist, Ku Klux Klan organizer, and later Western novelist. He co-wrote George Wallace\\'s well-known pro-segregation line of 1963, \"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\", and ran in the Democratic primary for governor of Alabama on a white supremacist ticket. Years later, under the pseudonym of supposedly Cherokee writer Forrest Carter, he wrote The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales (1972), a Western novel that was adapted into a 1976 film featuring Clint Eastwood that added to the National Film Registry, and The Education of Little Tree (1976), a best-selling, award-winning book which was marketed as a memoir but which turned out to be fiction.\\nIn 1976, following the success of The Rebel Outlaw and its film adaptation, The New York Times revealed Forrest Carter was actually Asa Carter.[1] His background became national news again in 1991 after his purported memoir, The Education of Little Tree (1976), was re-issued in paperback, topping the Times paperback best-seller lists (both non-fiction and fiction) and winning the American Booksellers Book of the Year (ABBY) award.\\nPrior to his literary career as \"Forrest\", Carter was politically active for years in Alabama as an opponent of the civil rights movement. In the mid-1950s, he had a syndicated segregationist radio show, and worked as a speech writer for segregationist Governor George Wallace of Alabama. He also founded the North Alabama Citizens Council (NACC), an independent offshoot of the White Citizens\\' Council movement formed by Carter when the White Citizens\\' Council tried to moderate Carter\\'s antisemitism. He also formed the militant and violent Ku Klux Klan group known as the Original Ku Klux Klan of the Confederacy, and started a monthly publication titled The Southerner which spread white supremacist and anti-communist rhetoric.\\nAsa Carter was born in Anniston, Alabama in 1925, the second eldest of four children.[2] Despite later claims (as author \"Forrest\" Carter) that he was orphaned, he was raised by his parents Hermione and Ralph Carter in nearby Oxford, Alabama. Both parents lived into Carter\\'s adulthood.\\nCarter served in the United States Navy during World War II and for a year studied journalism at the University of Colorado at Boulder on the G.I. Bill.[3]:\\u200a114\\u200a After the war, he married India Thelma Walker.[2] The couple settled in Birmingham, Alabama and had four children. His children were Ralph Walker Carter, Asa Earl Carter, both of Abilene, and Bedford Forrest Carter of Alabama; one daughter, India Lara Morgan of Jacksonville, Ala.[4]\\nCarter worked for several area radio stations before ending up at station WILD in Birmingham, where he worked from 1953 to 1955. Carter\\'s broadcasts from WILD, sponsored by the American States Rights Association, were syndicated to more than 20 radio stations before the show was cancelled. Carter was fired following community outrage over his attacks on National Brotherhood Week, which promoted friendship with the Jewish community, and a boycott of WILD.[3]:\\u200a114\\u200a Carter broke with the leadership of the Alabama Citizens\\' Council movement over the incident. He refused to reduce his antisemitic rhetoric, and the Citizens\\' Council preferred to focus on preserving racial segregation against African Americans.[3]:\\u200a116\\u200a\\nCarter started a renegade group called the North Alabama Citizens\\' Council. In addition to his careers in broadcasting and politics, Carter during these years ran a filling station.[3]:\\u200a116\\u200a By March 1956, he was making national news as a spokesman for segregation. Carter was quoted by United Press International as saying that the NAACP had \"infiltrated\" Southern white teenagers with \"immoral\" rock and roll records. Carter called for jukebox owners to purge all records by black performers from jukeboxes.[5]\\nCarter made the national news again on September 1[6] and 2[7] of the same year, after he gave an inflammatory anti-integration speech in Clinton, Tennessee. He addressed Clinton\\'s high school enrollment of 12 black students, and after his speech, an aroused mob of 200 white men stopped black drivers passing through, \"ripping out hood ornaments and smashing windows\". They were heading for the house of the mayor before being turned back by the local sheriff. Carter appeared in Clinton alongside segregationist John Kasper, who was charged later that same month with sedition and inciting a riot for his activities that day.[6][7] Later that year, Carter ran for a position on the Birmingham City Commission as the Commissioner For Public Safety against former office holder Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, who won that election in 1957. As with most elections during this time of poll taxes and segregation, the only competitive campaigning was done for the Democratic Party primary. Connor later became nationally famous for his heavy-handed approach to law enforcement during the civil rights struggles in Birmingham.[3]:\\u200a116\\u200a Carter siphoned away some of the \"white lower-status vote\" from Connor, but finished a distant last in the primary,[8] an indication that his style was becoming unacceptable to Alabama\\'s \"\\'respectable\\' segregationists.\"[3]\\nIn 1957, Carter and his brother James were jailed for fighting against Birmingham police officers. The police were trying to apprehend another of the six in their group, who was wanted for a suspected Ku Klux Klan (KKK) shooting.[9] The two men were both later found guilty of disorderly conduct and interfering with an officer and each fined $25.[10] Also during the mid-1950s, Carter founded a paramilitary KKK splinter group, called the \"Original Ku Klux Klan of the Confederacy\".[11] Carter started a monthly publication entitled The Southerner, devoted to purportedly scientific theories of white racial superiority, as well as to anti-communist rhetoric.[3]:\\u200a115\\u200a\\nIn April 1956, members of Carter\\'s new KKK group attacked singer Nat King Cole on stage at a Birmingham concert.[3]:\\u200a115\\u200a In September 1957, six members of Carter\\'s Klan group abducted and attacked a black handyman named Judge Edward Aaron. They castrated Aaron, poured turpentine on his wounds, and left him abandoned in the trunk of a car near Springdale, Alabama. Police found Aaron, near death from blood loss. Carter was not with the men who carried out this attack.[3]:\\u200a115\\u200a Four of the six involved were convicted of mayhem and sentenced to 20 years, but in 1963, a parole board, appointed by Carter\\'s then-employer Alabama governor George Wallace, commuted their sentences.[3]:\\u200a115\\u200a\\nIn 1958, Carter quit the Klan group he had founded after shooting two members in a dispute over finances. Birmingham police filed attempted murder charges against Carter, but the charges were subsequently dropped.[3]:\\u200a114\\u200a Carter also ran a campaign for lieutenant governor the same year that saw him finish fifth in a field of five.[11]\\nDuring the 1960s, Carter was a speechwriter for Wallace. He was one of two men credited with Wallace\\'s famous slogan \"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\", part of Wallace\\'s 1963 inaugural speech. Carter continued to work for Wallace, and after Wallace\\'s wife Lurleen was elected governor of Alabama in 1966, Carter worked for her.[12] Wallace never acknowledged the role Carter played in his political career:\\nTill the day he died, George Wallace denied that he ever knew Asa Carter. He may have been telling the truth. \\'Ace\\', as he was called by the staff, was paid off indirectly by Wallace cronies, and the only record that he ever wrote for Wallace was the word of former Wallace campaign officials such as finance manager Seymore Trammell.[11]When Wallace decided to enter national politics with a 1968 presidential run, he did not invite Carter on board for the campaign, as he sought to tone down his reputation as a segregationist firebrand. During the late 1960s, Carter grew disillusioned by what he saw as Wallace\\'s liberal turn on race.\\nCarter ran against Wallace for governor of Alabama in 1970 on a white supremacist platform. Carter finished last in a field of five candidates, winning only 1.51% of the vote in an election narrowly won by Wallace over the more moderate incumbent governor Albert Brewer. At Wallace\\'s 1971 inauguration, Carter and some of his supporters demonstrated against him, carrying signs reading \"Wallace is a bigot\" and \"Free our white children\". The demonstration was the last notable public appearance by \"Asa Carter\".[12]\\nAfter losing the election, Carter moved to Abilene, Texas,[13] where he started over. He began work on his first novel, spending days researching in a public library in Sweetwater, Texas. He distanced himself from his past, began to call his sons \"nephews\" and renamed himself Forrest Carter, after Nathan Bedford Forrest, a general of the Confederate army who fought in the Civil War,[13] and the first leader of the Ku Klux Klan.[14]\\nCarter moved to St. George\\'s Island, Florida in the 1970s[13] where he completed a sequel to his first novel, as well as two books on American Indian themes.[13] Carter separated from his wife, who remained in Florida. In the late 1970s, he again settled in Abilene, Texas.[11]\\nCarter\\'s best-known fictional works are The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales (1972, republished in 1975 as Gone to Texas) and The Education of Little Tree (1976), the latter book originally published as a memoir. Although Little Tree sold modestly during Carter\\'s life, it became a sleeper hit after his death.\\nClint Eastwood directed and starred in a film adaptation of Josey Wales, retitled The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) after Carter sent the book to his offices as an unsolicited submission, and Eastwood\\'s partner read and put his support behind it. At this time, neither man knew of Carter\\'s past as a Klansman and rabid segregationist. In 1997, after the success of the paperback edition of The Education of Little Tree, a film adaptation was produced. Originally intended as a TV movie, it was given a theatrical release.\\nCarter\\'s sequel to The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales, titled The Vengeance Trail of Josey Wales (1976), was planned by Clint Eastwood as a film project, but the project was cancelled.[15] The author\\'s Watch for Me on the Mountain (1978) is a fictionalized biography of Geronimo. It was reprinted in 1980 in an edition titled Cry Geronimo![16]\\nCarter was working on The Wanderings of Little Tree, a sequel to The Education of Little Tree, as well as a screenplay version of the book, when he died in Abilene on June 7, 1979. The cause of death was reported to have been heart failure. However, the ambulance driver told one of Carter’s friends that he had a drunken fight with his son, fell, and choked on his own vomit.[11][17][18] Carter\\'s body was returned to Alabama for burial near Anniston, Alabama.\\nCarter spent the last part of his life trying to conceal his background as a Klansman and segregationist, claiming categorically in a 1976 New York Times article that he, Forrest, was not Asa Carter.[12] The article describes a 1974 interview of Carter by Barbara Walters on the Today show, where Carter was under the name \"Forrest\" while promoting The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales. The Times reported that Carter, who had run for governor of Alabama (as Asa Carter) just four years earlier, was identified by several Alabama politicians, reporters, and law enforcement officials who watched the Today show segment as being the same person as Asa Carter. The Times also reported that the address Carter used in the copyright application for The Rebel Outlaw was identical to the one that he used in 1970 while running for governor. \"Beyond denying that he is Asa Carter,\" the article noted, \"the author has declined to be interviewed on the subject.\"\\nIn 1985, Carter\\'s autobiography was purchased for a paperback edition and marketed by the University of New Mexico Press as a memoir. It was subtitled \"A True Story by Forrest Carter\". The story described the relationship between the boy and his Scottish-Cherokee grandfather, a man named Wales (an overlap with Carter\\'s other fiction). Written from the perspective of a boy orphaned at age five, the book described how he had become accustomed to life in a remote mountain hollow with his \"Indian thinking\" \"Granpa\" and Cherokee \"Granma\", who called him \"Little Tree\". Granpa runs a small whiskey operation during Prohibition and the later years of the Great Depression. The grandparents and visitors to the hollow expose Little Tree to (supposed) Cherokee ways and \"mountain people\" values. The state removes him to an orphanage, where he stays for a few months until an old Indian friend intimidates the director into allowing Little Tree\\'s release. (In life, Carter was neither orphaned nor raised by Cherokee grandparents.)\\nBefore taking a new name and identity, Carter had claimed to have distant maternal Cherokee ancestry, a claim corroborated by some of his family members.[11] Delacorte Press\\'s original author biography referred to Carter as the Cherokee \"Storyteller in Council\". Members of the Cherokee nation have disputed his claim; they said so-called \"Cherokee\" words and customs in The Education of Little Tree are inaccurate, and the novel\\'s characters are stereotyped. Several scholars and critics[who?] agreed with this assessment, adding that Carter\\'s treatment of Native Americans repeated the romanticized notion of the \"Noble Savage\".\\nIn 1985, the University of New Mexico Press bought rights to The Education of Little Tree from original publisher Delacorte Press and published it in paperback. By its second year, the new paperback edition began to sell briskly through word-of-mouth publicity, with sales eventually surpassing 600,000.[19] Though Carter\\'s background as Asa Carter was discussed in academic circles, it was not widely known by the book-buying public nearly ten years after the 1976 New York Times article about him. In 1991, after the book won the American Booksellers Book of the Year (ABBY) award, it ranked number one on The New York Times non-fiction paperback best-seller list for several weeks.\\nOn October 4, 1991, Dan T. Carter, a history professor who speculated that, based on their shared heritage, he may be a distant cousin of Asa Carter (the supposition has since been stated elsewhere as fact),[20][21][22] published the article \"The Transformation of a Klansman\" in The New York Times. This article shed light on Asa Carter\\'s dual identity, and The Times shifted the book onto its fiction list.[17] Scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr. also wrote an article on Carter and Little Tree for The Times that appeared in November 1991.[23]\\nA film adaptation of Little Tree (1997), revived publicity about Asa Carter. His widow India Carter refused most interview requests during these years,[19] but confirmed to Publishers Weekly in 1991 that Forrest and Asa were the same person.[24] Eleanor Friede, Little Tree\\'s original editor, defended Carter\\'s background in 1997, telling the Times: \"[H]e was not a member of the Ku Klux Klan. I honestly don\\'t see the point of all this nasty gossip dragged out years ago.\"[19]\\nFollowing the 1991 publicity, the University of New Mexico Press changed the cover of Little Tree, removing the \"True Story\" subtitle and adding a fiction classification label. Little Tree has continued to find readers and a place on reading lists for young adults since 1991. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., argued that Little Tree can be appreciated for its message of tolerance and its other qualities despite its creator\\'s former life.\\nRichard Friedenberg wrote and directed the 1997 film adaptation. He also has defended the book, but not the author:\\nMr. Friedenberg said what appealed to him about the book was that \"the characters and milieu they were in represented everything that was good about America and everything that was bad.\" On the one hand, he said, the book dealt with the strength of the family and not necessarily with traditional families. On the other hand, he said, it dealt with ignorance and prejudice. Mr. Friedenberg said he found it perplexing and almost impossible to understand Mr. Carter\\'s motives and literary ambitions. Although Mr. Carter, who wrote four books, failed to address the issue of his bigotry publicly, Mr. Friedenberg said he believed that \"his apology was in his literature.\" For example, he said, the handful of Blacks and Jews in his books are depicted sympathetically. \"The bad guys are almost, without fail, rich whites, politicians and phony preachers,\" Mr. Friedenberg said.[19]Oprah Winfrey, who endorsed Little Tree in 1994, later removed it from her list of recommended book titles:\\n\"I no longer—even though I had been moved by the story—felt the same about this book,\" Winfrey said in 1994. \"There\\'s a part of me that said, \\'Well, OK, if a person has two sides of them and can write this wonderful story and also write the segregation forever speech, maybe that\\'s OK.\\' But I couldn\\'t—I couldn\\'t live with that.The book has also been criticized on literary grounds: \"I am surprised, of course, that Winfrey would recommend it,\" said Loriene Roy, president of the American Library Association. \"Besides the questions about the author\\'s identity, the book is known for a simplistic plot that used a lot of stereotypical imagery.\"[25]\\n(Articles cited about Carter faking his ethnicity)\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nWilla Sibert Cather (/ˈkæðər/;[1] born Wilella Sibert Cather;[2] December 7, 1873[A] – April 24, 1947) was an American writer known for her novels of life on the Great Plains, including O Pioneers!, The Song of the Lark, and My Ántonia. In 1923, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for One of Ours, a novel set during World War\\xa0I.\\nWilla Cather and her family moved from Virginia to Webster County, Nebraska, when she was nine years old. The family later settled in the town of Red Cloud.  Shortly after graduating from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, Cather moved to Pittsburgh for ten years, supporting herself as a magazine editor and high school English teacher. At the age of 33, she moved to New York City, her primary home for the rest of her life, though she also traveled widely and spent considerable time at her summer residence on Grand Manan Island, New Brunswick. She spent the last 39 years of her life with her domestic partner, Edith Lewis, before being diagnosed with breast cancer and dying of a cerebral hemorrhage. Cather and Lewis are buried together in Jaffrey, New Hampshire.\\nCather achieved recognition as a novelist of the frontier and pioneer experience. She wrote of the spirit of those settlers moving into the western states, many of them European immigrants in the nineteenth century. Common themes in her work include nostalgia and exile. A sense of place is an important element in Cather\\'s fiction: physical landscapes and domestic spaces are for Cather dynamic presences against which her characters struggle and find community.\\nCather was born in 1873 on her maternal grandmother\\'s farm in the Back Creek Valley near Winchester, Virginia.[18][19] Her father was Charles Fectigue Cather.[20] The Cather family originated in Wales,[21] the name deriving from Cadair Idris, a Gwynedd mountain.[22]:\\u200a3\\u200a Her mother was Mary Virginia Boak, a former school teacher.[23] By the time Cather turned twelve months old, the family had moved to Willow Shade, a Greek Revival-style home on 130 acres given to them by her paternal grandparents.[24]\\nMary Cather had six more children after Willa: Roscoe, Douglass,[B] Jessica, James, John, and Elsie.[27]:\\u200a5–7\\u200a Cather was closer to her brothers than to her sisters whom, according to biographer Hermione Lee, she \"seems not to have liked very much.\"[28]:\\u200a36\\u200a\\nAt the urging of Charles Cather\\'s parents, the family moved to Nebraska in 1883 when Willa was nine years old. The farmland appealed to Charles\\' father, and the family wished to escape the tuberculosis outbreaks that were rampant in Virginia.[28]:\\u200a30\\u200a Willa\\'s father tried his hand at farming for eighteen months, then moved the family into the town of Red Cloud, where he opened a real estate and insurance business, and the children attended school for the first time.[29]:\\u200a43\\u200a Some of Cather\\'s earliest work was first published in the Red Cloud Chief, the city\\'s local paper,[30] and Cather read widely, having made friends with a Jewish couple, the Wieners, who offered her free access to their extensive library in Red Cloud.[31] At the same time, she made house calls with the local physician and decided to become a surgeon.[32][33] For a short while, she signed her name as William,[34] but this was quickly abandoned for Willa instead.[18]\\nIn 1890, at the age of sixteen, Cather graduated from Red Cloud High School.[35] She moved to Lincoln, Nebraska to enroll at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. In her first year, her essay on Thomas Carlyle was published in the Nebraska State Journal without her knowledge.[36][37] After this, she published columns for $1 apiece, saying that seeing her words printed on the page had \"a kind of hypnotic effect\", pushing her to continue writing.[37][38] After this experience, she became a regular contributor to the Journal. In addition to her work with the local paper, Cather served as the main editor of The Hesperian, the university\\'s student newspaper, and became a writer for the Lincoln Courier.[39] While at the university, she learned mathematics from and was befriended by John J. Pershing, who later became General of the Armies and, like Cather, earned a Pulitzer Prize for his writing.[40][41] She changed her plans from studying science with the goal of becoming a physician, instead graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1895.[29]:\\u200a71\\u200a\\nCather\\'s time in Nebraska, still considered a frontier state, was a formative experience for her: She was moved by the dramatic environment and weather, the vastness of the prairie, and the various cultures of the immigrant[42] and Native American families in the area.[43][44]\\nIn 1896, Cather was hired to write for a women\\'s magazine, Home Monthly, and moved to Pittsburgh.[11][45] There, she wrote journalistic pieces, short stories, and poetry.[38] A year later, after the magazine was sold,[46] she became a telegraph editor and critic for the Pittsburgh Leader and frequently contributed poetry and short fiction to The Library, another local publication.[47] In Pittsburgh, she taught Latin, algebra, and English composition at Central High School for one year;[48] she then taught English and Latin at Allegheny High School, where she came to head the English department.[49][50]\\nShortly after moving to Pittsburgh, Cather wrote short stories, including publishing \"Tommy, the Unsentimental\" in the Home Monthly,[51] about a Nebraskan girl with a masculine name who looks like a boy and saves her father\\'s bank business. Janis P. Stout calls this story one of several Cather works that \"demonstrate the speciousness of rigid gender roles and give favorable treatment to characters who undermine conventions.\"[52] Cather resigned from her job at the Pittsburgh Leader in the late spring of 1900 before relocating to Washington, D.C. that fall.[53] In April 1902, Cather published her final contribution to the Lincoln Courier before going abroad with Isabelle McClung that summer.[53] Her first book, a collection of poetry called April Twilights, was published in 1903.[C] Shortly after this, in 1905, Cather\\'s first collection of short stories, The Troll Garden, was published. It contained some of her most famous stories, including \"A Wagner Matinee,\" \"The Sculptor\\'s Funeral,\" and \"Paul\\'s Case.\"[62]\\nAfter Cather was offered an editorial position at McClure\\'s Magazine in 1906, she moved to New York City.[63] Cather spent most of 1907 living in Boston, while working at McClure\\'s, writing a series of exposés about the religious leader Mary Baker Eddy, although freelance journalist Georgine Milmine was credited as the author.[64] A 1993 letter discovered in the Christian Science church archives by Eddy biographer Gillian Gill disclosed that Cather had (perhaps reluctantly) written articles 2 through 14 of the 14-part series.[65]  Milmine had performed copious amounts of research, but she had been unable to produce a manuscript independently, and McClure\\'s employed Cather and a few other editors including Burton J. Hendrick to assist her.[66] This biography was serialized in McClure\\'s over the next eighteen months and then published in book form as The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science (attributed to author Georgina Milmine, only confirmed decades later as really Willa Cather).[67]\\nMcClure\\'s also serialized Cather\\'s first novel, Alexander\\'s Bridge (1912). While most reviews were favorable,[68][69] such as The Atlantic calling the writing \"deft and skillful,\"[70] Cather herself soon saw the novel as weak and shallow.[71]\\nCather followed Alexander\\'s Bridge with her three novels set in the Great Plains, which eventually became both popular and critical successes: O Pioneers! (1913),[72] The Song of the Lark (1915),[73] and My Ántonia (1918),[74] which are—taken together—sometimes referred to as her \"Prairie Trilogy.\"[75][76] It is this succession of plains-based novels for which Cather was celebrated for her use of plainspoken language about ordinary people.[77][78] Sinclair Lewis, for example, praised her work for making Nebraska available to the wider world for the first time.[79] After writing The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald lamented that it was a failure in comparison to My Ántonia.[80]\\nAs late as 1920, Cather became dissatisfied with the performance of her publisher, Houghton Mifflin, which devoted an advertising budget of only $300 to My Ántonia,[81] and refused to pay for all the illustrations she commissioned for the book from Władysław T. Benda.[74] What\\'s more, the physical quality of the books was poor.[82] That year, she turned to the young publishing house, Alfred A. Knopf, which had a reputation for supporting its authors through advertising campaigns.[81] She also liked the look of its books and had been impressed with its edition of Green Mansions by William Henry Hudson.[81] She so enjoyed their style that all her Knopf books of the 1920s—save for one printing of her short story collection Youth and the Bright Medusa—matched in design on their second and subsequent printings.[83]\\nBy this time, Cather was firmly established as a major American writer, receiving the Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for her World War I-based novel, One of Ours.[81] She followed this up with the popular Death Comes for the Archbishop in 1927, selling 86,500 copies in just two years,[84] and which has been included on the Modern Library 100 Best Novels of the twentieth century.[81] Two of her three other novels of the decade—A Lost Lady and The Professor\\'s House—elevated her literary status dramatically. She was invited to give several hundred lectures to the public, earned significant royalties, and sold the movie rights to A Lost Lady. Her other novel of the decade, the 1926 My Mortal Enemy, received no widespread acclaim—and in fact, neither she nor her life partner, Edith Lewis, made significant mention of it later in their lives.[85]\\nDespite her success, she was the subject of much criticism, particularly surrounding One of Ours. Her close friend, Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant, saw the novel as a betrayal of the realities of war, not understanding how to \"bridge the gap between [Cather\\'s] idealized war vision ... and my own stark impressions of war as lived.\"[86] Similarly, Ernest Hemingway took issue with her portrayal of war, writing in a 1923 letter: \"Wasn\\'t [the novel\\'s] last scene in the lines wonderful? Do you know where it came from? The battle scene in Birth of a Nation. I identified episode after episode, Catherized. Poor woman, she had to get her war experience somewhere.\"[87]\\nIn 1929, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[88]\\nBy the 1930s, an increasingly large share of critics began to dismiss her as overly romantic and nostalgic, unable to grapple with contemporary issues:[89] Granville Hicks, for instance, charged Cather with escaping into an idealized past to avoid confronting the problems of the present.[90][91] And it was particularly in the context of the hardships of the Great Depression in which her work was seen as lacking social relevance.[92] Similarly, critics—and Cather herself[93]—were disappointed when her novel A Lost Lady was made into a film; the film had little resemblance to the novel.[94][95]\\nCather\\'s lifelong conservative politics,[96][D] appealing to critics such as Mencken, Randolph Bourne, and Carl Van Doren, soured her reputation with younger, often left-leaning critics like Hicks and Edmund Wilson.[101][102] Despite this critical opposition to her work, Cather remained a popular writer whose novels and short story collections continued to sell well; in 1931 Shadows on the Rock was the most widely read novel in the United States, and Lucy Gayheart became a bestseller in 1935.[19]\\nAlthough Cather made her last trip to Red Cloud in 1931 for a family gathering after her mother\\'s death, she stayed in touch with her Red Cloud friends and sent money to Annie Pavelka and other families during the Depression years.[28]:\\u200a327\\u200a In 1932, Cather published Obscure Destinies, her final collection of short fiction, which contained \"Neighbour Rosicky,\" one of her most highly regarded stories. That same summer, she moved into a new apartment on Park Avenue with Edith Lewis, and during a visit on Grand Manan, she probably began working on her next novel, Lucy Gayheart.[103][E] She was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1934.[122]\\nCather suffered two devastating losses in 1938.[123][124][125] In June, her favorite brother, Douglass, died of a heart attack. Cather was too grief-stricken to attend the funeral.[29]:\\u200a478\\u200a Four months later, Isabelle McClung died. Cather and McClung had lived together when Cather first arrived in Pittsburgh, and while McClung eventually married the musician Jan Hambourg and moved with her husband to Toronto,[126][127] the two women remained devoted friends.[128][129][F] Cather wrote that Isabelle was the person for whom she wrote all her books.[132]\\nDuring the summer of 1940, Cather and Lewis went to Grand Manan for the last time, and Cather finished her final novel, Sapphira and the Slave Girl, a book much darker in tone and subject matter than her previous works.[29]:\\u200a483\\u200a[133] While Sapphira is understood by readers as lacking a moral sense and failing to evoke empathy,[134] the novel was a great critical and commercial success, with an advance printing of 25,000 copies.[84] It was then adopted by the Book of the Month Club,[135] which bought more than 200,000 copies.[136] Her final story, \"The Best Years\",[137] intended as a gift for her brother,[138] was retrospective. It contained images or \"keepsakes\" from each of her twelve published novels and the short stories in Obscure Destinies.[139]\\nAlthough an inflamed tendon in her hand hampered her writing, Cather managed to finish a substantial part of a novel set in Avignon, France. She had titled it Hard Punishments and placed it in the 14th century during the reign of Antipope Benedict XIV.[28]:\\u200a371\\u200a She was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1943.[140] The same year, she executed a will that prohibited the publication of her letters and dramatization of her works.[131] In 1944, she received the gold medal for fiction from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, a prestigious award given for an author\\'s total accomplishments.[141]\\nCather was diagnosed with breast cancer in December 1945 and underwent a mastectomy on January 14, 1946.[142]:\\u200a294–295\\u200a By early 1947, her cancer  had metastasized to her liver, becoming stage IV cancer.[142]:\\u200a296\\u200aOn April 24, 1947, Cather died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 73 in her home at 570 Park Avenue in Manhattan.[143][144] After Cather\\'s death, Edith Lewis destroyed the manuscript of Hard Punishments according to Cather\\'s instructions.[145] She is buried at the southwest corner of Jaffrey, New Hampshire\\'s Old Burying Ground,[146][147][148] a place she first visited when joining Isabelle McClung and her husband, violinist Jan Hambourg,[149] at the Shattuck Inn.[150][151] Lewis was buried alongside Cather some 25 years later.[152]\\nNovels\\nShort fiction\\nPoetry\\nNonfiction and Prose Collections\\nScholars disagree about Cather\\'s sexual identity. Some believe it impossible or anachronistic to determine whether she had same-sex attraction,[153][154] while others disagree.[155][156][157] Researcher Deborah Carlin suggests that denial of Cather being a lesbian is rooted in treating same-sex desire \"as an insult to Cather and her reputation\", rather than a neutral historical perspective.[158] Melissa Homestead has argued that Cather was attracted to Edith Lewis, and in so doing, asked: \"What kind of evidence is needed to establish this as a lesbian relationship? Photographs of the two of them in bed together? She was an integral part of Cather\\'s life, creatively and personally.\"[18] Beyond her own relationships with women, Cather\\'s reliance on male characters has been used to support the idea of her same-sex attraction.[159][G] Harold Bloom calls her \"erotically evasive in her art\" due to prevailing \"societal taboos\".[163]\\nIn any event, throughout Cather\\'s adult life, her closest relationships were with women. These included her college friend Louise Pound; the Pittsburgh socialite Isabelle McClung, with whom Cather traveled to Europe and at whose Toronto home she stayed for prolonged visits;[164] the opera singer Olive Fremstad;[165] and most notably, the editor Edith Lewis, with whom Cather lived the last 39 years of her life.[166]\\nCather\\'s relationship with Lewis began in the early 1900s. They lived together in a series of apartments in New York City from 1908 until Cather\\'s death in 1947. From 1913 to 1927, Cather and Lewis lived at No. 5 Bank Street in Greenwich Village.[167] They moved when the apartment was scheduled for demolition during the construction of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue New York City Subway line (now the 1, \\u200b2, and \\u200b3 trains).[168][169] While Lewis was selected as the literary trustee for Cather\\'s estate,[55] she was not merely a secretary for Cather\\'s documents but an integral part of Cather\\'s creative process.[170]\\nBeginning in 1922, Cather spent summers on the island of Grand Manan in New Brunswick, where she bought a cottage in Whale Cove on the Bay of Fundy. This is where her short story \"Before Breakfast\" is set.[19][171] She valued the seclusion of the island and did not mind that her cottage had neither indoor plumbing nor electricity. Anyone wishing to reach her could do so by telegraph or mail.[29]:\\u200a415\\u200a In 1940, she stopped visiting Grand Manan after Canada\\'s entrance to World War II, as travel was considerably more difficult; she also began a long recuperation from gallbladder surgery in 1942 that restricted travel.[172][142]:\\u200a266–268\\u200a\\nA resolutely private person, Cather destroyed many drafts, personal papers, and letters, asking others to do the same.[173] While many complied, some did not.[174] Her will restricted the ability of scholars to quote from the personal papers that remain.[131] But in April 2013, The Selected Letters of Willa Cather—a collection of 566 letters Cather wrote to friends, family, and literary acquaintances such as Thornton Wilder and F. Scott Fitzgerald—was published, two years after the death of Cather\\'s nephew and second literary executor, Charles Cather. Willa Cather\\'s correspondence revealed the complexity of her character and inner world.[175] The letters do not disclose any intimate details about Cather\\'s personal life, but they do \"make clear that [her] primary emotional attachments were to women.\"[176] The Willa Cather Archive at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln works to digitize her complete body of writing, including private correspondence and published work. As of 2021, about 2,100 letters have been made freely available to the public, in addition to transcription of her own published writing.[177][178]\\nCather admired Henry James\\'s use of language and characterization.[179] While Cather enjoyed the novels of several women—including George Eliot,[180] the Brontës, and Jane Austen—she regarded most women writers with disdain, judging them overly sentimental.[29]:\\u200a110\\u200a One contemporary exception was Sarah Orne Jewett, who became Cather\\'s friend and mentor.[H] Jewett advised Cather of several things: to use female narrators in her fiction (even though Cather preferred using male perspectives),[185][186] to write about her \"own country\" (O Pioneers! was dedicated to Jewett),[187][188][189] and to write fiction that explicitly represented romantic attraction between women.[190][191][192][I] Cather was also influenced by the work of Katherine Mansfield,[102] praising in an essay Mansfield\\'s ability \"to throw a luminous streak out onto the shadowy realm of personal relationships.\"[194]\\nCather\\'s high regard for the immigrant families forging lives and enduring hardships on the Nebraska plains shaped much of her fiction. The Burlington Depot in Red Cloud brought in many strange and wonderful people to her small town. As a child, she visited immigrant families in her area and returned home in \"the most unreasonable state of excitement,\" feeling that she \"had got inside another person\\'s skin.\"[22]:\\u200a169–170\\u200a After a trip to Red Cloud in 1916, Cather decided to write a novel based on the events in the life of her childhood friend Annie Sadilek Pavelka, a Bohemian girl who became the model for the title character in My Ántonia.[74][195][196] Cather was likewise fascinated by the French-Canadian pioneers from Quebec who had settled in the Red Cloud area while she was a girl.[197][198]\\nDuring a brief stopover in Quebec with Edith Lewis in 1927, Cather was inspired to write a novel set in that French-Canadian city. Lewis recalled: \"From the first moment that she looked down from the windows of the [Chateau] Frontenac [Hotel] on the pointed roofs and Norman outlines of the town of Quebec, Willa Cather was not merely stirred and charmed—she was overwhelmed by the flood of memories, recognition, surmise it called up; by the sense of its extraordinary French character, isolated and kept intact through hundreds of years, as if by a miracle, on this great un-French continent.\"[29]:\\u200a414–15\\u200a Cather finished her novel Shadows on the Rock, a historical novel set in 17th-century Quebec, in 1931;[199] it was later included in Life magazine\\'s list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924–1944.[200] The French influence is found in many other Cather works, including Death Comes for the Archbishop (1927) and her final, unfinished novel set in Avignon, Hard Punishments.[197]\\nAlthough Cather began her writing career as a journalist, she made a distinction between journalism, which she saw as being primarily informative, and literature, which she saw as an art form.[201]:\\u200a27\\u200a Cather\\'s work is often marked by—and criticized for[202]—its nostalgic tone[102][203][204] and themes drawn from memories of her early years on the American plains.[205][206] Consequently, a sense of place is integral to her work: notions of land,[207] the frontier,[J] pioneering and relationships with western landscapes are recurrent.[209][210][211] Even when her heroines were placed in an urban environment, the influence of place was critical, and the way that power was displayed through room layout and furniture is evident in her novels like My Mortal Enemy.[212] Though she hardly confined herself to writing exclusively about the Midwest, Cather is virtually inseparable from the Midwestern identity that she actively cultivated (even though she was not a \"native\" Midwesterner).[213] While Cather is said to have significantly altered her literary approach in each of her novels,[214][215] this stance is not universal; some critics have charged Cather with being out of touch with her times and failing to use more experimental techniques in her writing, such as stream of consciousness.[201]:\\u200a36\\u200a[216][217] At the same time, others have sought to place Cather alongside modernists by either pointing to the extreme effects of her apparently simple Romanticism[218] or acknowledging her own \"middle ground\":\\nShe had formed and matured her ideas on art before she wrote a novel. She had no more reason to follow Gertrude Stein and James Joyce, whose work she respected, than they did to follow her. Her style solves the problems in which she was interested. She wanted to stand midway between the journalists whose omniscient objectivity accumulate more fact than any character could notice and the psychological novelist whose use of subjective point of view stories distorts objective reality. She developed her theory on a middle ground, selecting facts from experience on the basis of feeling and then presenting the experience in a lucid, objective style.[219]The English novelist A. S. Byatt has written that with each work Cather reinvented the novel form to investigate the changes in the human condition over time.[220] Particularly in her frontier novels, Cather wrote of both the beauty and terror of life.[221] Like the exiled characters of Henry James, an author who had a significant influence on the author,[222] most of Cather\\'s major characters live as exiled immigrants,[221] identifying with the immigrants\\' \"sense of homelessness and exile\" following her own feelings of exile living on the frontier. It is through their engagement with their environment that they gain their community.[223] Susan J. Rosowski wrote that Cather was perhaps the first to grant immigrants a respectable position in American literature.[224]\\nIn 1962, Willa Cather was inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame.[225]\\nIn 1973, the United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp honoring her.[226]\\nIn 1974, she was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners.[227]\\nIn 1986, she was inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame’s Hall of Fame.[228][229]\\nIn 1988, she was inducted into the National Women\\'s Hall of Fame.[227]\\nIn 2000, she was named as one of the Virginia Women in History.[230]\\nIn 2023, the U.S. state of Nebraska donated a bronze sculpture of Cather by Littleton Alston to the National Statuary Hall Collection. The statue is installed in the United States Capitol\\'s Capitol Visitors Center, in Washington, D.C.[231]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nRobert William Chambers (May 26, 1865 – December 16, 1933) was an American artist and fiction writer, best known for his book of short stories titled The King in Yellow, published in 1895.\\nChambers was born in Brooklyn, New York, to William P. Chambers (1827–1911), a corporate and bankruptcy lawyer, and Caroline Smith Boughton (1842–1913). His parents met when his mother was twelve years old and William P. was interning with her father, Joseph Boughton, a prominent corporate lawyer. Eventually the two formed the law firm of Chambers and Boughton which continued to prosper even after Joseph\\'s death in 1861. Robert Chambers\\'s great-grandfather, William Chambers (birth unknown), a lieutenant in the British Royal Navy, was married to Amelia Saunders (1765–1822), a great-granddaughter of Tobias Saunders of Westerly, Rhode Island. The couple moved from Westerly to Greenfield, Massachusetts, and then to Galway, New York, where their son, also named William Chambers (1798–1874), was born. The second William graduated from Union College at the age of 18, and then went to a college in Boston, where he studied medicine. Upon graduating, he and his wife, Eliza P. Allen (1793–1880), a direct descendant of Roger Williams,[1] the founder of Providence, Rhode Island, were among the first settlers of Broadalbin, New York. His brother was the architect Walter Boughton Chambers.\\nChambers was first educated at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, and then entered the Art Students\\' League at around the age of twenty, where the artist Charles Dana Gibson was a fellow student. Chambers studied in Paris at the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Julian from 1886 to 1893, and his work was displayed at the Salon as early as 1889. \\nOn his return to New York, he succeeded in selling his illustrations to Life, Truth, and Vogue magazines. Then, for reasons unclear, he devoted his time to writing, producing his first novel, In the Quarter, written in 1887 in Munich. His most famous, and perhaps most meritorious, effort is The King in Yellow, a collection of Art Nouveau short stories published in 1895. This included several famous weird short stories that are connected by the theme of a fictitious drama of the same title, which drives those who read it insane.[2] E. F. Bleiler described The King in Yellow as one of the most important works of American supernatural fiction.[3] It was also strongly admired by H. P. Lovecraft and his circle.\\nChambers returned to the weird genre in his later short story collections The Maker of Moons, The Mystery of Choice and The Tree of Heaven, but none earned him as much success as The King in Yellow. Some of Chambers\\'s work contains elements of science fiction, such as In Search of the Unknown and Police!!!, about a zoologist who encounters monsters.[4]\\nChambers\\'s main work of historical fiction was a series of novels set during the Franco-Prussian War. These novels were The Red Republic (1895, centring on the Paris Commune), Lorraine (1898),  Ashes of Empire (1898) and Maids of Paradise (1903).[5][6][7] Chambers wrote Special Messenger (1909), Ailsa Paige (1910) and Whistling Cat (1932), novels set during the American Civil War.[7] Chambers also wrote Cardigan (1901), a historical novel for younger readers, set at the outbreak of the American Revolution.[6][7] Chambers later turned to writing romantic fiction to earn a living. According to some estimates, Chambers had one of the most successful literary careers of his period, his later novels selling well and a handful achieving best-seller status.[7] Chambers\\' romance novels often featured intimate relationships between \"caddish\" men and sexually willing women, resulting in some reviewers accusing Chambers\\' works of promoting immorality.[7] Many of his works were also serialised in magazines.\\nHis novel The Man They Hanged was about Captain Kidd, and argued that Kidd was not a pirate but had been made a scapegoat by the British government.[1]\\nDuring World War I, Chambers wrote war adventure novels and war stories, some of which showed a strong return to his old weird style, such as \"Marooned\" in Barbarians (1917). After 1924 he devoted himself solely to writing historical fiction.\\nChambers for several years made Broadalbin, New York, his summer home. Some of his novels touch upon colonial life in Broadalbin and Johnstown.\\nOn July 12, 1898, he married Elsa (Elsie) Vaughn Moller (1872–1939). They had a son, Robert Edward Stuart Chambers (1899–1955) (who sometimes used the name Robert Husted Chambers).\\nRobert W. Chambers died on December 16, 1933, three days after undergoing intestinal surgery.[1]\\nH. P. Lovecraft said of Chambers in a letter to Clark Ashton Smith:\\nChambers is like Rupert Hughes and a few other fallen Titans – equipped with the right brains and education but wholly out of the habit of using them.[8]Despite Chambers\\'s effective later abandonment of the weird supernatural tale, these early works are all that remained in print through most of the twentieth century, thanks to Lovecraft\\'s inclusion of them in the critical study \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\".\\nFrederic Taber Cooper commented:\\nSo much of Mr Chambers\\'s work exasperates, because we feel that he might so easily have made it better.\"[9]In an overview of Chambers\\' historical fiction, Wendy Bousfield stated that the historical novel Cardigan was \"Chambers\\' most highly praised historical novel\" during his lifetime. Bousfield also argued that much of Chambers\\' historical fiction was marred by poorly written characters and \"insensitive humor at the expense of ethnic types\". Bousfield also wrote that \"Chambers\\' trivializing of human relationships is regrettable, since his recreation of period details of dress and daily life is vivid and historically accurate.\"[7]\\nCritical studies of Chambers\\'s horror and fantasy work include Lee Weinstein\\'s essay in Supernatural Fiction Writers,[10] Brian Stableford\\'s essay in the\\nSt. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers[11] and a chapter in S. T. Joshi\\'s book The Evolution of the Weird Tale (2004).\\nChambers\\'s novel The Tracer of Lost Persons was adapted into a long-running (1937–54) radio crime drama, Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons, by soap opera producers Frank and Anne Hummert.[12]\\nChambers\\'s The King in Yellow has inspired many modern authors, including Karl Edward Wagner, Joseph S. Pulver, Lin Carter, James Blish, Nic Pizzolatto, Michael Cisco, Stephen King, Ann K. Schwader, Robert M. Price, Galad Elflandsson and Charles Stross.\\n',\n",

       "  'Walter Van Tilburg Clark (August 3, 1909 – November 10, 1971) was an American novelist, short story writer, poet, and educator. He ranks as one of Nevada\\'s most distinguished literary figures of the 20th century, and was the first inductee into the \\'Nevada Writers Hall of Fame\\' in 1988, together with Robert Laxalt, Clark\\'s mentee and Nevada\\'s other heralded twentieth century author. Two of Clark\\'s novels, The Ox-Bow Incident and The Track of the Cat, were made into films. As a writer, Clark taught himself to use the familiar materials of the western saga to explore the human psyche and to raise deep philosophical issues.\\nClark was born in East Orland, Maine, but grew up in Reno, Nevada and graduated from Reno High School in 1926. Clark went to college at the University of Nevada, Reno where his father Walter Ernest Clark was President. In 1933 Clark married Barbara Frances Morse and moved to Cazenovia, New York, where he taught high school English and began his fiction-writing career.\\nClark\\'s first published novel, The Ox-Bow Incident (1940), was successful and is often considered to be the first modern Western, without the usual clichés and formulaic plots of the genre.[2] The novel is a story about a lynch mob mistaking three innocent travelers for cattle rustlers suspected of murder. After the travelers are hanged, the lynch mob finds that they killed the wrong suspects. The novel\\'s themes include an examination of frontier law and order, as well as culpability. The novel was well-received, gave Clark literary acclaim that was unusual for a writer of Westerns, and in 1943 was adapted into a movie starring Henry Fonda and Harry Morgan.\\nOver the next decade, Clark published two more novels: The City of Trembling Leaves (1945) and The Track of the Cat (1949). In 1950, a collection of short stories, The Watchful Gods and Other Stories, was released. Since they began appearing in national magazines during the 1940s, Clark\\'s short stories gained national recognition and earned the O. Henry Prize five times, in quick succession, between 1941 and 1945.[3] After this initial success in the short story format, some of these stories (notably \"Hook\" and \"The Wind And The Snow Of Winter\") have been repeatedly anthologized as classic examples of the genre.[1][4] Clark\\'s short story, \"The Portable Phonograph\" - a poignant depiction of survivors in the aftermath of a war (and not a nuclear war as some claim, since it was written in 1941) - is also well known. Two Hollywood films were inspired by Clark\\'s writings, and one of these (The Ox-Bow Incident) received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. The other film was Track of the Cat, based on Clark\\'s novel The Track of the Cat. (Note that the film\\'s title drops the definite article used in the novel\\'s title).\\nAlthough he continued to write more sporadically after 1950, Clark published no more fiction works during the remaining two decades of his life. Thereafter, Clark devoted his creative energies to teaching and lecturing. From 1954 to 1956, he was a professor of creative writing at the University of Montana in Missoula, where he was noted by his students for his teaching skills and for his eccentric clothing which consisted of a blue turtleneck shirt, maroon corduroy jacket, grey slacks and blue socks which never varied throughout the term. Clark began teaching at a writer\\'s workshop at San Francisco State University during the summer of 1955, moving to San Francisco in 1956 after he was hired there full-time to establish a formal Creative Writing Program.[5] He remained there until 1962.[1]\\nClark would return to Reno to serve as the writer-in-residence at the university from 1962 until his death from cancer in Virginia City, Nevada, on November 10, 1971, at aged 62.[6] He spent the last ten years of his life editing The Journals of Alfred Doten. He died almost two years after the death of his wife Barbara (Frances Morse) Clark. Both of them died of cancer, as Clark\\'s biographer Jackson J. Benson noted in his biography of Clark, The Ox-Bow Man.[7] Clark was chosen, along with Robert Laxalt, to be the first writer inducted into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame[8] when it was established in 1988 by the Friends of the University of Nevada Libraries.[9]\\nFiction\\nPoetry\\nOther\\n\\n',\n",

The album title is taken from a poem by Frank Stanford.\\nRobert Adamson noted that Coburn’s poems “come from tough experiences, yet are created with a muscular craft that glows with alert intelligence”.[10] Due to its openness in dealing with personal themes such as mental illness, trauma, addiction, self-harm and suicide, Coburn’s work has often been categorised as confessional poetry. Sarah Holland-Batt wrote that Coburn’s “raw and intimate poems are marked by a strong presence of voice: confessional, consolatory, despairing, and defiant” and that his poems “speak of impulses that are often repressed or left unsaid.”[11]\\nHis work is also known for using imagery related to his upbringing on his family’s farm, horses and rodeo.

A past president of Western Writers of America, Coldsmith wrote more than 40 books, as well as hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles.  His \"Spanish Bit Saga\", a series of related novels, helped to re-define the Western novel by adopting the point of view of the Native Americans, rather than the European immigrants.\\nIn addition to his career as a writer, Coldsmith was a medical doctor, serving as a family practitioner in Emporia, Kansas, until 1988, when he chose to concentrate on writing.  In addition, Coldsmith and his second wife Edna were cattle ranchers and breeders of Appaloosa horses.\\nSon of a Methodist preacher, Coldsmith attended high school in Coffeyville, Kansas, and joined the U.S. Army in 1944.  His role as a combat medic in the Pacific Theater of World War II led him to Japan, where he was among the first occupying troops.  He was assigned to provide medical care for Japanese war criminals, including Hideki Tōjō, the prime minister.\\nAfter the war, Coldsmith matriculated at Baker University, a small Methodist institution in Baldwin City, Kansas. While there he became a brother to the Zeta Chi fraternity. After graduation, he worked as a YMCA youth director in Topeka, where he helped to achieve the first interracial public swimming pool in the state.\\nColdsmith, who had periodically taught English classes at Emporia State University, was awarded the Western Writers of America\\'s Golden Spur award for best original paperback for The Changing Wind of 1990.  Other honors include Distinguished Kansan (awarded by the Native Sons and Daughters of Kansas in 1993) and the Edgar Wolfe Award for lifetime contributions to literature (1995).

He died on June 25, 2009, at The University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, according to his wife Edna.[2]\\nColdsmith employs a distinctly lucid and deceptively simple style in his fictional narratives. His prose does not attract attention to itself, with the result that the focus is almost entirely on the story. His characters, who may at first seem uncomplicated, gradually emerge as well-rounded human beings with a complex of often conflicting motives and emotions. Coldsmith\\'s Native American protagonists are genuine, and often likable, human beings. At the same time, Coldsmith\\'s villains, who are usually Indians themselves, are portrayed as being misled, or suffering from delusion, more than being evil in some sinister or fundamental way.\\nThough generally well balanced in his portrayal of Native American societies and immigrant societies, Coldsmith\\'s narratives often offer gentle—and sometimes not so gentle—criticism of European-American culture, especially in matters of the spirit.\\nColdsmith uses English to achieve the illusion of a native point of view with consistent use of such expressions as \"I am made to think. . .\" and \"Elk-Dog\" (for horse) and \"Cold Maker\" (for winter) .\\nThe Spanish Bit Saga, arguably Coldsmith\\'s best known work, chronicles the unique moment in history when the horse was introduced to the Plains Indians by Spanish explorers, one of whom is separated from his party and adopted by a fictional Plains tribe.

He wrote articles documenting the Marines in World War II as a combat correspondent.  He wrote novels, most of which were westerns, but also wrote science fiction.  And, as television became ever-present in American culture, Germano wrote numerous television scripts for western, science-fiction, drama, and cartoon series.\\nGermano was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the eldest of six children. His parents, Italian immigrants from the town of Cigliano, gave him the name Pietro Baptisto Germano, which became Peter B. early in his life. As a young man, he worked several jobs, including as a clerk for the local railroad. It was during his employment at the local train station that he met his wife, Muriel Garant. She was an actress and model, who worked in theater in Cape Cod, but took a job at the railroad station in New Bedford, Massachusetts during World War II. The couple married in February 1943, just before Germano left to serve in the Pacific Theater in World War II. He had a few short stories published in magazines before his tour of duty.[1]\\nAs a war correspondent for the United States Marine Corps, Germano wrote numerous articles that appeared in various newspapers. After the war Peter and Muriel lived in Chicago until he was called to serve in the Korean War in 1950. A few years later, the family settled in Anaheim, California (within walking distance to the newly opened Disneyland). Germano and his wife raised four children, while he began a successful writing career.\\nThroughout his career in the military and his work as a writer, Germano went to college to receive two degrees. With only two years of high school, he attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island from 1946-1950. After his service in the Korean War, Germano transferred to Chapman College in Orange, California in 1956 and received a B. A. in 1959. In 1968, he attended Loyola Marymount University, where he earned his Master of Arts in 1970. From 1971-1973, Germano was a part-time lecturer at Loyola Marymount, where he taught Advanced Writing for Film and Television to graduate students.\\nWith his transition from military to civilian life complete, Germano worked tirelessly on the bulk of his fiction career. He wrote western novels under several pseudonyms, and in the 1950s and 1960s wrote television scripts for several western and science fiction programs.[2]\\nWith a steady career, the family moved in 1966 to a new suburban home in Thousand Oaks, California, located north of Los Angeles in Ventura County. By the 1970s, he had published a science fiction novel, mystery short stories, and western short stories for the Jim Hatfield series in \"Texas Rangers\".\\nGermano collaborated with his wife, Muriel, on several projects. In the 1970s, he became the associate editor of The Californian, the newspaper of the Golden State Mobilehome Owners League. When the editor of the newspaper, Thomas Thompson, retired, Germano and his wife took over as editors; a position which they held for eight years. During this same time period, with grandchildren visiting often, the couple wrote scripts for several animated cartoons televisions series, including The Little Prince.\\nA strong supporter of union labor, Germano was a member of the Writers Guild of America, West. He also held memberships to the Western Writers of America (which published \"The Roundup\" out of the University of Texas at El Paso), the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and the Marine Corps Combat Correspondents Association.\\nGermano died in 1983. When not writing, he hiked the golden hills of California. His ashes were spread in the hills near Thousand Oaks.

Called \"a master western storyteller,\"[1] Cook published dozens of short stories and 50 novels before his death at age 42. A number of his stories and novels were turned into Hollywood westerns, including the 1961 John Ford film Two Rode Together.\\nBorn in Richmond, Indiana,[2] Cook ran away from home at age 16 and joined the U.S. Army cavalry[2] before serving as a pilot in the Pacific during World War II. During the war he was severely wounded in the leg but later returned to active duty.[2]\\nAfter the war Cook worked as a salvage worker, judo instructor, a bush pilot in Alaska, and as a deputy sheriff in California.[2][3] Cook died of a heart attack in 1964[3] while building a schooner in which he and his wife Thea hoped to sail around the world.[2]\\nCook started writing westerns in 1951 and published 100 short stories and 50 novels[3] before dying at the age of 42.[4]\\nIn 1959, Cook used the penname Wade Everett for a series of paperbacks released by Ballantine Books, with these novels being reprinted numerous times over the following decades. Among these was The Last Scout, published in 1960 and considered one of his best novels.[3] The novel is about an unrepentant hell raiser who comes to Deadwood to live with his daughter\\'s family.[2] Other notable books of his include The Wind River Kid (Fawcett, 1958), where the main character of The Last Scout is now a drunk who gets thrown into the job of sheriff, and The Wranglers (Fawcett, 1960), about an older horse-breaker and his partner who travel to monument country in Southern Utah while dealing with personal issues.[2]\\nPublishers Weekly called Cook \"a master western storyteller.[1] His fiction frequently featured the use of \"recurring characters to link otherwise standalone stories,\" as shown in his collection of novellas The Devil\\'s Roundup, which Booklist called \"One of the best posthumous western collections to be offered in many years.[4] Most of his books deal with traditional western themes of reformed outlaws, range wars and fights with Native Americans, but some also focused on romance.[3]\\nAfter Cook\\'s death a number of posthumous books by him were released.

       "  'Courtney Ryley Cooper (October 31, 1886 – September 29, 1940) was an American circus performer, publicist and writer.  During his career he published over 30 books, many focusing on crime; J. Edgar Hoover considered him at one time \"the best informed man on crime in the U. S.\" He was also an expert on circuses, and was the chief publicist for Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey Circus at the time of his death.\\nCourtney Ryley Cooper was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on October 31, 1886.  At the age of 16, he left home to join a traveling circus and eventually became a circus clown, working his way up to general manager of the circus.\\nLater, he worked as a newspaper reporter for The Kansas City Star, New York World, the Chicago Tribune and the Denver Post.  In 1914, as a result of his work at the Post, he became the press agent for the Sells-Floto Circus, which was owned by the owners of the Post.  The Sells-Floto had absorbed the assets of William \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody\\'s Wild West Show, including Buffalo Bill himself.\\nOn August 1, 1918, Cooper joined the United States Marine Corps.  He rose to the rank of second lieutenant and was sent to France to conduct historical research on the Marines.\\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Cooper wrote screenplays, including the narrative for the Frank Buck film Wild Cargo and the Art-O-Graf film Riders of the Range, short stories, novels, magazine articles, and popular non-fiction books.  He published 30 books during his career.  Most of his non-fiction work focused on two subjects — the circus and crime.  He was Annie Oakley\\'s first biographer.  His books Here\\'s to Crime (1937), Ten-Thousand Public Enemies (1935) and Designs in Scarlet (1939) championed the cause of the young Federal Bureau of Investigation and made the case that corrupt local governments and police forces permitted lawlessness to flourish in many parts of the United States.\\nCooper\\'s work was much admired by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who once said he is \"the best informed man on crime in the U. S.\"[1] —  even allowing Cooper access to FBI case files.   Cooper is widely believed to have ghostwritten the book Persons in Hiding (1938) as well as a number of magazine articles for Hoover. A 1936 newspaper article in the Chicago Daily Tribune identified Cooper as one of Hoover\\'s few close personal friends, along with Clyde Tolson and a man named Frank Baughman.[2] The article goes on to state that after Ten Thousand Public Enemies came out in 1935, Cooper \"was rewarded with a propaganda post in the department of justice, with the express function of publicizing the division of investigation.\"\\nIn 1934, Cooper began writing scripts for The Gibson Family on NBC radio. The show was an effort \"to bring an original musical to the air every week.\"[3] He left the program in May 1935, when the sponsor revised the format in a cost-cutting effort.[3]\\nIn 1940, Cooper worked with comic strip artist Dale Messick, and suggested the first storyline for Messick\\'s Brenda Starr, Reporter.[4]\\nCooper wrote extensively on the danger of illicit drugs, particularly marijuana.  He collaborated with Federal Bureau of Narcotics Director Harry Anslinger on the article \"Marijuana, Assassin of Youth\",[5] which originally appeared in The American Magazine in July 1937.\\nSome of Cooper\\'s correspondence with Hoover is archived at the University of Alaska Anchorage Library.[6]\\nOn September 29, 1940, Cooper committed suicide by hanging himself in the closet of a hotel room in the Park Central Hotel in New York City.  He left a note instructing that the cash in his clothing should be used to settle his hotel bill but giving no indication as to a motivation for his suicide. In his FBI file, there are letters to Hoover from two associates stating that Cooper did not commit suicide but was murdered.\\nMrs. Cooper,[7] of Los Angeles, could advance no reason for his suicide, but told police he had been morose over alleged snubs he had received in Washington when he sought to inform officials of German activities he said he discovered in Mexico.  Finally, she said, he had conferred with his close friend and writing collaborator, J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, but she did not know the result of their conferences.  Mrs. Cooper said her husband had made an exhaustive investigation in Mexico several months earlier and unearthed details of German conditions and propaganda there.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nJames Fenimore Cooper (September 15, 1789 – September 14, 1851) was an American writer of the first half of the 19th century, whose historical romances depicting colonial and indigenous characters from the 17th to the 19th centuries brought him fame and fortune. He lived much of his boyhood and his last fifteen years in Cooperstown, New York, which was founded by his father William Cooper on property that he owned. Cooper became a member of the Episcopal Church shortly before his death and contributed generously to it.[1] He attended Yale University for three years, where he was a member of the Linonian Society.[2]\\nAfter a stint on a commercial voyage, Cooper served in the U.S. Navy as a midshipman, where he learned the technology of managing sailing vessels which greatly influenced many of his novels and other writings. The novel that launched his career was The Spy, a tale about espionage set during the American Revolutionary War and published in 1821.[3] He also created American sea stories. His best-known works are five historical novels of the frontier period, written between 1823 and 1841, known as the Leatherstocking Tales, which introduced the iconic American frontier scout, Natty Bumppo. Cooper\\'s works on the U.S. Navy have been well received among naval historians, but they were sometimes criticized by his contemporaries. Among his more famous works is the Romantic novel The Last of the Mohicans, often regarded as his masterpiece.[4] Throughout his career, he published numerous social, political, and historical works of fiction and non-fiction with the objective of countering European prejudices and nurturing an original American art and culture.\\nCooper was born in Burlington, New Jersey, in 1789 to William Cooper and Elizabeth (Fenimore) Cooper, the eleventh of 12 children, half of whom died during infancy or childhood.\\nShortly after James\\' first birthday, his family moved to Cooperstown, New York, a community founded by his father on a large piece of land which he had bought for development. Later, his father was elected to the United States Congress as a representative from Otsego County. Their town was in a central area of New York along the headwaters of the Susquehanna River that had previously been patented to Colonel George Croghan by the Province of New York in 1769. Croghan mortgaged the land before the Revolution and after the war part of the tract was sold at public auction to William Cooper and his business partner Andrew Craig.[5] By 1788, William Cooper had selected and surveyed the site where Cooperstown would be established. He erected a home on the shore of Otsego Lake and moved his family there in the autumn of 1790. Several years later he began construction of the mansion that became known as Otsego Hall, completed in 1799 when James was ten.[6]\\nCooper was enrolled at Yale University at age 13, but he incited a dangerous prank which involved blowing up another student\\'s door—after having already locked a donkey in a recitation room.[7] He was expelled in his third year without completing his degree, so he obtained work in 1806 as a sailor and joined the crew of a merchant vessel at age 17.[2][8] By 1811, he obtained the rank of midshipman in the fledgling United States Navy, conferred upon him by an officer\\'s warrant signed by Thomas Jefferson.[4][9]\\nWilliam Cooper had died more than a year before, in 1809, when James was 20. All five of his sons inherited a supposed-large fortune in money, securities, and land titles, which soon proved to be a wealth of endless litigation. James married Susan Augusta de Lancey at Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York on January 1, 1811, at age 21.[10] She was from a wealthy family who remained loyal to Great Britain during the Revolution. The Coopers had seven children, five of whom lived to adulthood. Their daughter Susan Fenimore Cooper was a writer on nature, female suffrage, and other topics. Her father edited her works and secured publishers for them.[11] One son, Paul Fenimore Cooper, became a lawyer and perpetuated the author\\'s lineage to the present.\\nIn 1806, at the age of 17, Cooper joined the crew of the merchant ship Sterling as a common sailor. At the time, the Sterling was commanded by young John Johnston from Maine. Cooper served as a common seaman before the mast. His first voyage took some 40 stormy days at sea and brought him to an English market in Cowes where they sought information on where best to unload their cargo of flour. There, Cooper saw his first glimpses of England. Britain was in the midst of war with Napoleon\\'s France at the time, so their ship was immediately approached by a British man-of-war and was boarded by some of its crew. They seized one of the Sterling\\'s best crewmen and impressed him into the British Royal Navy.[12][13][a] Cooper thus first encountered the power of his country\\'s former colonial master, which led to a lifelong commitment to helping create an American art independent culturally as well as politically from the former mother country.[attribution needed]\\nTheir next voyage took them to the Mediterranean along the coast of Spain, including Águilas and Cabo de Gata, where they picked up cargo to be taken to London and unloaded. Their stay in Spain lasted several weeks and impressed the young sailor, the accounts of which Cooper later referred to in his Mercedes of Castile, a novel about Columbus.[15]\\nAfter serving aboard the Sterling for 11 months, he joined the United States Navy on January 1, 1808, when he received his commission as a midshipman. Cooper had conducted himself well as a sailor, and his father, a former U.S. Congressman, easily secured a commission for him through his long-standing connections with politicians and naval officials.[16][17] The warrant for Cooper\\'s commission as midshipman was signed by President Jefferson and mailed by Naval Secretary Robert Smith, reaching Cooper on February 19. On February 24, he received orders to report to the naval commander at New York City.[b] Joining the United States Navy fulfilled an aspiration he had had since his youth.[18]\\nCooper\\'s first naval assignment came on March 21, 1808, aboard the USS\\xa0Vesuvius, an 82-foot bomb ketch that carried twelve guns and a thirteen-inch mortar.[19] For his next assignment, he served under Lieutenant Melancthon Taylor Woolsey near Oswego on Lake Ontario, overseeing the building of the brig USS\\xa0Oneida for service on the lake. The vessel was intended for use in a war with Great Britain which had yet to begin.[20] The vessel was completed, armed with sixteen guns, and launched in Lake Ontario in the spring of 1809. It was in this service that Cooper learned shipbuilding, shipyard duties and frontier life. During his leisure time, Cooper would venture through the forests of New York state and explore the shores of Lake Ontario. He occasionally ventured into the Thousand Islands. His experiences in the Oswego area later inspired some of his work, including his novel The Pathfinder.[21][c]\\nAfter completion of the Oneida in 1809, Cooper accompanied Woolsey to Niagara Falls, who then was ordered to Lake Champlain to serve aboard a gunboat until the winter months when the lake froze over. Cooper himself returned from Oswego to Cooperstown and then New York City. On November 13 of the same year, he was assigned to the USS\\xa0Wasp under the command of Captain James Lawrence, who was from Burlington and became a personal friend of Cooper\\'s. Aboard this ship, he met his lifelong friend William Branford Shubrick, who was also a midshipman at the time. Cooper later dedicated The Pilot, The Red Rover and other writings to Shubrick.[23][24] Assigned to humdrum recruiting tasks rather than exciting voyages, Cooper resigned his commission from the navy in spring 1810; in the same time period he met, wooed, and became engaged to Susan Augusta de Lancey, whom he married on January 1, 1811.\\nIn 1820, when reading a contemporary novel to his wife Susan, he decided to try his hand at fiction, resulting in a neophyte novel set in England he called Precaution (1820). Its focus on morals and manners was influenced by Jane Austen\\'s approach to fiction. Precaution was published anonymously and received modestly favorable notice in the United States and England.[25] By contrast, his second novel The Spy (1821) was inspired by an American tale related to him by neighbor and family friend John Jay. It became the first novel written by an American to become a bestseller at home and abroad, requiring several re-printings to satisfy demand. Set in the \"Neutral Ground\" between British and American forces and their guerrilla allies in Westchester County, New York, the action centers on spying and skirmishing taking place in and around what is widely believed to be John Jay\\'s family home \"The Locusts\" in Rye, New York of which a portion still exists today as the historic Jay Estate.[26]\\nFollowing on a swell of popularity, Cooper published The Pioneers, the first of the Leatherstocking series in 1823. The series features the inter-racial friendship of Natty Bumppo, a resourceful American woodsman who is at home with the Delaware Indians, and their chief, Chingachgook. Bumppo was also the main character of Cooper\\'s most famous novel The Last of the Mohicans (1826), written in New York City where Cooper and his family lived from 1822 to 1826. The book became one of the more widely read American novels of the 19th century.[27] At this time, Cooper had been living in New York on Beach Street in what is now downtown\\'s Tribeca.\\nIn 1823, he became a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. In August of that same year, his first son died.[28] He organized the influential Bread and Cheese Club that brought together American writers, editors, artists, scholars, educators, art patrons, merchants, lawyers, politicians, and others.[29]\\nIn 1824, General Lafayette arrived from France aboard the Cadmus at Castle Garden in New York City as the nation\\'s guest. Cooper witnessed his arrival and was one of the active committee of welcome and entertainment.[30][31]\\nIn 1826, Cooper moved his family to Europe,[32] where he sought to gain more income from his books, provide better education for his children, improve his health, and observe European manners and politics firsthand. While overseas, he continued to write. His books published in Paris include The Prairie, the third Leather-Stocking Tale in which Natty Bumppo dies in the western land newly acquired by Jefferson as the Louisiana Purchase. There he also published The Red Rover and The Water Witch, two of his many sea stories. During his time in Paris, the Cooper family became active in the small American expatriate community. He became friends with painter (and later inventor) Samuel Morse and with French general and American Revolutionary War hero Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette.[33][7] Cooper admired the patrician liberalism of Lafayette, who sought to recruit him to his causes, and eulogized him as a man who \"dedicated youth, person, and fortune, to the principles of liberty.\"[34]\\nCooper\\'s distaste for the corruption of the European aristocracy, especially in England and France, grew as he observed them manipulate the legislature and judiciary to the exclusion of other classes.[35] In 1832, he entered the lists as a political writer in a series of letters to Le National, a Parisian journal. He defended the United States against a string of charges brought by the Revue Britannique. For the rest of his life, he continued skirmishing in print, sometimes for the national interest, sometimes for that of the individual, and frequently for both at once.[36]\\nThis opportunity to make a political confession of faith reflected the political turn that he already had taken in his fiction, having attacked European anti-republicanism in The Bravo (1831). Cooper continued this political course in The Heidenmauer (1832) and The Headsman: The Abbaye des Vignerons (1833). The Bravo depicted Venice as a place where a ruthless oligarchy lurks behind the mask of the \"serene republic\". All were widely read on both sides of the Atlantic, though some Americans accused Cooper of apparently abandoning American life for European—not realizing that the political subterfuges in the European novels were cautions directed at his American audiences. Thus The Bravo was roughly treated by some critics in the United States.[37]\\nIn 1833, Cooper returned to the United States and published \"A Letter to My Countrymen\" in which he gave his criticism of various social and political mores. Promotional material from a modern publisher summarizes his goals as follows:\\nA Letter to My Countrymen remains Cooper\\'s most trenchant work of social criticism. In it, he defines the role of the \"man of letters\" in a republic, the true conservative, the slavery of party affiliations, and the nature of the legislative branch of government. He also offers her most persuasive argument on why America should develop its own art and literary culture, ignoring the aristocratically tainted art of Europe.[39]Influenced by the ideals of classical republicanism, Cooper feared that the orgy of speculation he witnessed was destructive of civic virtue and warned Americans that it was a \"mistake to suppose commerce favorable to liberty\"; doing so would lead to a new \"moneyed aristocracy\". Drawing upon philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Burlamaqui, and Montesquieu, Cooper\\'s political ideas were both democratic, deriving from the consent of the governed, and liberal, concerned with the rights of the individual.[40]\\nIn the later 1830s—despite his repudiation of authorship in \"A Letter to My Countrymen\"—he published Gleanings in Europe, five volumes of social and political analysis of his observations and experiences in Europe. His two novels Homeward Bound and Home as Found also criticize the flamboyant financial speculation and toadyism he found on his return; some readers and critics attacked the works for presenting a highly idealized self-portrait, which he vigorously denied.[citation needed]\\nIn June 1834, Cooper decided to reopen his ancestral mansion Otsego Hall at Cooperstown. It had long been closed and falling into decay; he had been absent from the mansion nearly 16 years. Repairs were begun, and the house was put in order. At first, he wintered in New York City and summered in Cooperstown, but eventually he made Otsego Hall his permanent home.[41]\\nOn May 10, 1839, Cooper published History of the Navy of the United States of America, a work that he had long planned on writing. He publicly announced his intentions to author such a historical work while abroad before departing for Europe in May 1826, during a parting speech at a dinner given in his honor:\\nEncouraged by your kindness ... I will take this opportunity of recording the deeds and sufferings of a class of men to which this nation owes a debt of gratitude—a class of men among whom, I am always ready to declare, not only the earliest, but many of the happiest days of my youth have been passed.[42]Cooper\\'s historical account of the U.S. Navy was well received, though his account of the roles played by the American leaders in the Battle of Lake Erie led to years of disputes with their descendants, as noted below. Cooper had begun thinking about this massive project in 1824, and concentrated on its research in the late 1830s. His close association with the U.S. Navy and various officers, and his familiarity with naval life at sea provided him the background and connections to research and write this work. Cooper\\'s work is said to have stood the test of time and is considered an authoritative account of the U.S. Navy during that time.[43]\\nIn 1844, Cooper\\'s Proceedings of the naval court martial in the case of Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, a commander in the navy of the United States, &c. was first published in Graham\\'s Magazine of 1843–44. It was a review of the court martial of Alexander Slidell Mackenzie who had hanged three crew members of the brig USS Somers for mutiny while at sea. One of the hanged men, 19-year-old Philip Spencer, was the son of U.S. Secretary of War John C. Spencer. He was executed without court-martial along with two other sailors aboard the Somers for attempting mutiny.\\nThe Proceedings publication was one of Cooper\\'s print skirmishes. Maritime historian Samuel Eliot Morison called it vindictive revenge for Mackenzie\\'s publishing a critical review of Cooper\\'s inaccurate history of the Battle of Lake Erie, noting that Cooper \"flattered himself that his tract would \\'finish\\' Mackenzie as a naval officer, which it certainly did not.\"[44]  Others, however, assert that Cooper recognized the need for absolute discipline in a warship at sea, and felt sympathetic to Mackenzie over his pending court martial.[45][46]\\nIn 1843, an old shipmate, Ned Myers, re-entered Cooper\\'s life. To assist him—and hopefully to cash in on the popularity of maritime biographies—Cooper wrote Myers\\'s story which he published in 1843 as Ned Myers; or, A Life Before the Mast, an account of a common seaman still of interest to naval historians.[citation needed]\\nIn 1846, Cooper published Lives of Distinguished American Naval Officers covering the biographies of William Bainbridge, Richard Somers, John Shaw, John Templar Shubrick, and Edward Preble.[47][48] Cooper died in 1851.[49] In May 1853, Cooper\\'s Old Ironsides appeared in Putnam\\'s Monthly. It was the history of the Navy ship USS\\xa0Constitution and, after European and American Scenery Compared, 1852, was one of several posthumous publications of his writings.[50] In 1856, five years after Cooper\\'s death, his History of the Navy of the United States of America was re-published in an expanded edition. The work was an account of the U.S. Navy in the early 19th century, through the Mexican War.[43][51] Among naval historians of today, the work has come to be recognized as a general and authoritative account. However, it was criticized for accuracy on some points by some contemporaries, especially those engaged in the disputes over the roles of their relatives in Cooper\\'s separate history of the Battle of Lake Erie. Whig editors of the period regularly attacked anything Cooper wrote, leading him to numerous suits for libel, for example against Park Benjamin, Sr., a poet and editor of the Evening Signal of New York.[52]\\nCooper\\'s writings of the 1830s related to current politics and social issues, coupled with his perceived self-promotion, increased the ill feeling between the author and some of the public. Criticism in print of his naval histories and the two Home novels came largely from newspapers supporting The Whig party, reflecting the antagonism between the Whigs and their opposition, the Democrats, whose policies Cooper often favored. Cooper\\'s father William had been a staunch Federalist, a party now defunct but some of whose policies supporting large-scale capitalism the Whigs endorsed. Cooper himself had come to admire Thomas Jefferson, the bete-noire of the Federalists, and had supported Andrew Jackson\\'s opposition to a National Bank. Never one to shrink from defending his personal honor and his sense of where the nation was erring, Cooper filed legal actions for libel against several Whig editors; his success with most of his lawsuits ironically led to more negative publicity from the Whig establishment.[citation needed]\\nBuoyed by his frequent victories in court, Cooper returned to writing with more energy and success than he had had for several years. As noted above, on May 10, 1839, he published his History of the U.S. Navy;[43] his return to the Leatherstocking Tales series with The Pathfinder, or The Inland Sea (1840) and The Deerslayer (1841) brought him renewed favorable reviews. But on occasion he returned to addressing public issues, most notably with a trilogy of novels called the Littlepage Manuscripts addressing the issues of the anti-rent wars. Public sentiment largely favored the anti-renters, and Cooper\\'s reviews again were largely negative.\\nFaced with competition from younger writers and magazine serialization, and lower prices for books resulting from new technologies, Cooper simply wrote more in his last decade than in either of the previous two. Half of his thirty-two novels were written in the 1840s. They may be grouped into three categories: Indian romances, maritime fiction, and political and social controversy—though the categories often overlap.[citation needed]\\nThe 1840s began with the last two novels featuring Natty Bumppo, both critical and reader successes: The Pathfinder (1840) and The Deerslayer (1841). Wyandotte, his last novel set in the Revolutionary War, followed in 1843 and Oak Openings in 1848. The nautical works were Mercedes of Castile (in which Columbus appears, 1840), The Two Admirals (British and French fleets in battle, 1842), Wing-And-Wing (a French privateer fighting the British in 1799, 1842), Afloat and Ashore (two volumes exploring a young man growing up, 1844), Jack Tier (a vicious smuggler in the Mexican-American War, 1848), and The Sea Lions (rival sealers in the Antarctic, 1849).[citation needed]\\nHe also turned from pure fiction to the combination of art and controversy in which he achieved notoriety in the novels of the previous decade. His Littlepage Manuscripts trilogy--Satanstoe (1845), The Chainbearer (1845), and The Redskins (1846)—dramatized issues of land ownership in response to renters in the 1840s opposing the long leases common in the old Dutch settlements in the Hudson Valley. He tried his hand with serialization with The Autobiography of a Pocket Handkerchief, first published in Graham\\'s Magazine in 1843, a satire on contemporary nouveau riche. In The Crater; or, Vulcan\\'s Peak (1847) he introduced supernatural machinery to show the decline of an ideal society in the South Seas when demagogues prevail. The Ways of the Hour, his last completed novel, portrayed a mysterious and independent young woman defending herself against criminal charges.[53]\\nCooper spent the last years of his life back in Cooperstown. He died on September 14, 1851, the day before his 62nd birthday. He was buried in the Christ Episcopal Churchyard, where his father, William Cooper, was buried. Cooper\\'s wife Susan survived her husband only by a few months and was buried by his side at Cooperstown.[citation needed]\\nSeveral well-known writers, politicians, and other public figures honored Cooper\\'s memory with a memorial in New York, six months after his death, in February 1852. Daniel Webster gave a speech to the gathering while Washington Irving served as a co-chairman, along with William Cullen Bryant, who also gave an address which did much to restore Cooper\\'s damaged reputation among American writers of the time.[54][55]\\nCooper\\'s father was a lapsed Quaker; probably influenced by his wife\\'s family, the DeLanceys, Cooper in his fiction often favorably depicted clergy of the Episcopal Church, though Calvinist ministers came in for their share of both admiring and critical treatment. In the 1840s as Cooper increasingly despaired over the United States maintaining the vision and promise of the Constitution, his fiction increasingly turned to religious themes. In The Wing-And-Wing, 1842, the hero, a French revolutionary free-thinker, loses the Italian girl he loves because he cannot accept her simple Christianity. In contrast, in the 1849 The Sea Lions the hero wins his beloved only after a spiritual transformation while marooned in the Antarctic. And the 1848 The Oak Openings features a pious Parson Amen who wins the admiration of the Indians who kill him, praying for them during torture.[citation needed]\\nAfter establishing permanent residence in Cooperstown, Cooper became active in Christ Episcopal Church, taking on the roles of warden and vestryman. As the vestryman, he donated generously to this church and later supervised and redesigned its interior with oak furnishings at his own expense. He was also energetic as a representative from Cooperstown to various regional conventions of the Episcopal church. But only several months before his death, in July 1851, was he confirmed in this church by his brother-in-law, the Reverend William H. DeLancey.[56][57][58]\\nCooper was one of the more popular 19th-century American authors, and his work was admired greatly throughout the world.[59] While on his death bed, the Austrian composer Franz Schubert wanted most to read more of Cooper\\'s novels.[60] Honoré de Balzac, the French novelist and playwright, admired him greatly.[61] Henry David Thoreau, while attending Harvard, incorporated some of Cooper\\'s style in his own work.[62] D.H. Lawrence believed that Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Maupassant, and Flaubert were all \"so very obvious and coarse, besides the lovely, mature and sensitive art of Fennimore Cooper.\" Lawrence called The Deerslayer \"one of the most beautiful and perfect books in the world: flawless as a jewel and of gem-like concentration.\"[63]\\nCooper\\'s work, particularly The Pioneers and The Pilot, demonstrate an early 19th-century American preoccupation with alternating prudence and negligence in a country where property rights were often still in dispute.[64]\\nCooper was one of the early major American novelists to include African, African-American and Native American characters in his works. In particular, Native Americans play central roles in his Leatherstocking Tales. However, his treatment of this group is complex and highlights the relationship between frontier settlers and American Indians as exemplified in The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish, depicting a captured white girl who marries an Indian chief and has a baby with him, but after several years is eventually returned to her parents.[65] Often, he gives contrasting views of Native characters to emphasize their potential for good, or conversely, their proclivity for mayhem. The Last of the Mohicans includes both the character of Magua, who fearing the extinction of his race at the hands of the whites savagely betrays them, as well as Chingachgook, the last chief of the Mohicans, who is portrayed as Natty Bumppo\\'s noble, courageous, and heroic counterpart.[66]\\nIn 1831, Cooper was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.\\nAccording to Tad Szulc, Cooper was a devotee of Poland\\'s causes (uprisings to regain Polish sovereignty). He organized a club in Paris to support the rebels, and brought flags of the defeated Polish rebel regiment from Warsaw to present them to the exiled leaders in Paris. With his friend the Marquis de La Fayette, he supported liberals during the regime changes in France and elsewhere in the 1830s.[67]\\nThough some scholars have hesitated to classify Cooper as a strict Romantic, Victor Hugo pronounced him greatest novelist of the century outside France.[61] Honoré de Balzac, while mocking a few of Cooper\\'s novels (\"rhapsodies\") and expressing reservations about his portrayal of characters, enthusiastically called The Pathfinder a masterpiece and professed great admiration for Cooper\\'s portrayal of nature, only equalled in his view by Walter Scott.[68] Mark Twain, the ultimate Realist, criticized the Romantic plots and overwrought language of The Deerslayer and The Pathfinder in his satirical but shrewdly observant essay, \"Fenimore Cooper\\'s Literary Offenses\" (1895).[69]\\nCooper was also criticized heavily in his day for his depiction of women characters in his work. James Russell Lowell, Cooper\\'s contemporary and a critic, referred to it poetically in A Fable for Critics, writing, \"... the women he draws from one model don\\'t vary / All sappy as maples and flat as a prairie.\"[70]\\nCooper\\'s lasting reputation today rests largely upon the five Leatherstocking Tales. In his 1960 study focusing on romantic relationships, both hetero- and homo-sexual, literary scholar Leslie Fiedler opines that with the exception of the five Natty Bumppo-Chingachgook novels, Cooper\\'s \"collected works are monumental in their cumulative dullness.\"[71] More recent criticism views all thirty-two novels in the context of Cooper\\'s responding to changing political, social, and economic realities in his time period.\\nCooper was honored on a U.S. commemorative stamp, the Famous American series, issued in 1940.\\nCooper appears briefly as a character in Anya Seton\\'s 1944 historical romance Dragonwyck.\\nThree dining halls at the State University of New York at Oswego are named in Cooper\\'s remembrance (Cooper Hall, The Pathfinder, and Littlepage) because of his temporary residence in Oswego and for setting some of his works there.[72]\\nCooper Park in Michigan\\'s Comstock Township is named after him.[73]\\nThe New Jersey Turnpike has a James Fenimore Cooper service area, recognizing his birth in the state.\\nThe gilded and red tole chandelier hanging in the library of the White House in Washington DC is from the family of James Fenimore Cooper.[74] It was brought there through the efforts of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in her great White House restoration. The James Fenimore Cooper Memorial Prize at New York University is awarded annually to an outstanding undergraduate student of journalism.[75]\\nIn 2013, Cooper was inducted into the New York Writers Hall of Fame.\\nCooper\\'s novels were very popular in the rest of the world, including, for instance, Russia. In particular, great interest of the Russian public in Cooper\\'s work was primarily incited by the novel The Pathfinder, which the renowned Russian literary critic Vissarion Belinsky declared to be \"a Shakespearean drama in the form of a novel\".[76] The author was more recognizable by his middle name, Fenimore, exotic to many in Russia. This name became a symbol of exciting adventures among Russian readers. For example, in the 1977 Soviet movie The Secret of Fenimore (Russian: Тайна Фенимора), being the third part of a children\\'s television miniseries Three Cheerful Shifts (Russian: Три весёлые смены[77]), tells of a mysterious stranger known as Fenimore, visiting a boys\\' dorm in a summer camp nightly and relating fascinating stories about Indians and extraterrestrials.\\n Category\\n',\n",

He wrote articles documenting the Marines in World War II as a combat correspondent.  He wrote novels, most of which were westerns, but also wrote science fiction.  And, as television became ever-present in American culture, Germano wrote numerous television scripts for western, science-fiction, drama, and cartoon series.\\nGermano was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the eldest of six children. His parents, Italian immigrants from the town of Cigliano, gave him the name Pietro Baptisto Germano, which became Peter B. early in his life. As a young man, he worked several jobs, including as a clerk for the local railroad. It was during his employment at the local train station that he met his wife, Muriel Garant. She was an actress and model, who worked in theater in Cape Cod, but took a job at the railroad station in New Bedford, Massachusetts during World War II. The couple married in February 1943, just before Germano left to serve in the Pacific Theater in World War II. He had a few short stories published in magazines before his tour of duty.[1]\\nAs a war correspondent for the United States Marine Corps, Germano wrote numerous articles that appeared in various newspapers. After the war Peter and Muriel lived in Chicago until he was called to serve in the Korean War in 1950. A few years later, the family settled in Anaheim, California (within walking distance to the newly opened Disneyland). Germano and his wife raised four children, while he began a successful writing career.\\nThroughout his career in the military and his work as a writer, Germano went to college to receive two degrees. With only two years of high school, he attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island from 1946-1950. After his service in the Korean War, Germano transferred to Chapman College in Orange, California in 1956 and received a B. A. in 1959. In 1968, he attended Loyola Marymount University, where he earned his Master of Arts in 1970. From 1971-1973, Germano was a part-time lecturer at Loyola Marymount, where he taught Advanced Writing for Film and Television to graduate students.\\nWith his transition from military to civilian life complete, Germano worked tirelessly on the bulk of his fiction career. He wrote western novels under several pseudonyms, and in the 1950s and 1960s wrote television scripts for several western and science fiction programs.[2]\\nWith a steady career, the family moved in 1966 to a new suburban home in Thousand Oaks, California, located north of Los Angeles in Ventura County. By the 1970s, he had published a science fiction novel, mystery short stories, and western short stories for the Jim Hatfield series in \"Texas Rangers\".\\nGermano collaborated with his wife, Muriel, on several projects. In the 1970s, he became the associate editor of The Californian, the newspaper of the Golden State Mobilehome Owners League. When the editor of the newspaper, Thomas Thompson, retired, Germano and his wife took over as editors; a position which they held for eight years. During this same time period, with grandchildren visiting often, the couple wrote scripts for several animated cartoons televisions series, including The Little Prince.\\nA strong supporter of union labor, Germano was a member of the Writers Guild of America, West. He also held memberships to the Western Writers of America (which published \"The Roundup\" out of the University of Texas at El Paso), the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and the Marine Corps Combat Correspondents Association.\\nGermano died in 1983. When not writing, he hiked the golden hills of California. His ashes were spread in the hills near Thousand Oaks.

       "  'James Oliver Curwood (June 12, 1878 – August 13, 1927) was an American action-adventure writer and conservationist. His books were often based on adventures set in the Hudson Bay area, the Yukon or Alaska and ranked among the top-ten best sellers in the United States in the early and mid 1920s, according to Publishers Weekly. At least one hundred and eighty motion pictures have been based on or directly inspired by his novels and short stories; one was produced in three versions from 1919 to 1953. At the time of his death, Curwood was the highest paid (per word) author in the world.[1]\\nHe built Curwood Castle as a place to greet guests and as a writing studio in his hometown of Owosso, Michigan. The castle was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is now operated by the city as a museum. The city commemorates him with an annual Curwood Festival.\\nCurwood was born in Owosso, Michigan, the youngest of four children.  His great-grandmother was Mohawk and this influenced his later books which often feature First Nations characters and storylines.[2][3] Attending local schools, Curwood left high school before graduation. He passed the entrance exam to the University of Michigan and was allowed to enroll  in the English department, where he studied journalism.\\nAfter two years, Curwood quit college to become a reporter, moving to Detroit for work. In 1898, he sold his first story while attending the University of Michigan. In 1907 he was hired by the Canadian government to travel to the northern reaches of Canada to write and publish accounts of his travels to encourage tourism, his trips in Canada inspired his wilderness adventure stories. For many years he traveled to the Hudson Bay area, the Yukon and Alaska for several months each year for more inspiration. He wrote and published twenty-eight adventure/nature novels, two collections of short stories, one non-fiction volume (The Great Lakes), a volume of introspection (God\\'s Country: The Trail to Happiness), and an autobiography, (The Glory of Living).\\nBy 1922, Curwood had become very wealthy from the success of his writing. After a tour of Europe with his family where he toured old European castles, he came home and built his own, Curwood Castle in Owosso, Michigan. Constructed in the style of an 18th-century French chateau, the castle is set on the Shiawassee River near downtown Owosso. In one of the castles two large turrets, Curwood set up his writing studio. He also owned a lodge on the Ausable River near Roscommon, Michigan that he used as a retreat for rest and relaxation from his rigorous writing career.\\nCurwood was an avid hunter in his youth; however, as he grew older, he became an advocate of conservation and environmentalism. He was appointed to the Michigan Conservation Commission in 1927.[4] The change in his attitude toward wildlife is expressed in a quote from The Grizzly King: \"The greatest thrill is not to kill but to let live.\"\\nCurwood\\'s daughter, Carlotta Curwood Tate, documented in an account in the Curwood Collector that in 1927, while on a fishing trip in Florida, Curwood was bitten or stung through hip waders by something, source unknown. Health problems related to the bite escalated over the next few months as an infection developed. He died in Owosso at the age of 49, and was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery there in a family plot.\\nCurwood\\'s adventure writing followed in the tradition of Jack London. Curwood set many of his works in the wilds of the Great Northwest and often used animals as lead characters (Kazan; Baree, Son of Kazan, The Grizzly King, and Nomads of the North).  Many of Curwood\\'s adventure novels also feature romance as primary or secondary plot consideration. This approach gave his work broad commercial appeal; his novels ranked on many best-seller lists in the early and mid 1920s. One of his most successful books was his 1919 novel, The River\\'s End. The book sold more than 100,000 copies and was the fourth best-selling title of the year in the United States, according to Publishers Weekly.[5]\\nCurwood\\'s short stories and other pieces were published in various literary and popular magazines throughout his career. His bibliography includes more than 200 such articles, short stories, and serializations. His work was also published in Canada and the United Kingdom. Some of his books were translated into French, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Czech and Polish, and published in those respective countries.\\nOver one hundred and eighty movies have been based on or inspired by Curwood\\'s novels and short stories. Curwood\\'s story \"Wapi the Walrus\" was adapted for film three times. The first was as Back to God\\'s Country (1919), starring Nell Shipman as a brave and adventurous woman in the wilds of the North.[6] Another version by the same title was released in 1927, and again by this title in 1953.[7]\\nA young John Wayne and Noah Beery Jr. starred in the 1934 film The Trail Beyond, based on Curwood\\'s novel The Wolf Hunters. Filmmakers produced a film series featuring Kirby Grant as Mountie Corporal Rod Webb, assisted by his dog Chinook; they made a total of ten films.\\nIn the late 20th century, French director Jean-Jacques Annaud adapted Curwood\\'s 1916 novel The Grizzly King as the film The Bear (1988). The film\\'s success prompted a revival of interest in Curwood\\'s books.\\n',\n",

A native of Oregon, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel Honey in the Horn, the only Pulitzer Prize for Literature given to a native Oregonian.[1][2] Later living in California and Texas, he also wrote short stories for magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post.\\nDavis was born in Nonpareil, Douglas County, Oregon, in the Umpqua River Valley, and lived in Roseburg in his early years.[3] His father was a teacher and the family moved frequently as he took up different teaching positions. They moved to Antelope, Oregon in 1906, and two years later they were in The Dalles, where his father was now a principal.[3] In 1912 Davis graduated from high school there. He held various short-term jobs, with the county, with Pacific Power and Light, and in a local bank. He also worked as a railroad timekeeper and with a survey party near Mount Adams.\\nHis first poems were published in April 1919 in Poetry, edited by Harriet Monroe. These were eleven poems published together under the title Primapara. Later that year they won the magazine\\'s Levinson Prize, worth $200. Davis also received a letter of praise from poet Carl Sandburg. Davis continued to publish poems in the magazine throughout the 1920s, and also sold some poems to H. L. Mencken\\'s The American Mercury. Mencken encouraged him to begin writing prose.\\nIn 1926, Davis and James Stevens privately published a small booklet, Status Rerum: A Manifesto Upon the Present Condition of Northwest Literature. Although only a few copies were printed, the booklet attracted notice because of its bluntness and invective against the local literary scene of Portland. Robinson Jeffers memorably described the pamphlet as a \"rather grimly powerful wheel to break butterflies on.\"[4]\\nTogether with his new wife, the former Marion Lay of The Dalles, Davis moved to Seattle in August 1928. There he increased his literary efforts. His first published prose began appearing in The American Mercury in 1929. These were picturesque but hardly complimentary sketches of The Dalles and Eastern Oregon. One of the first was entitled \"A Town in Eastern Oregon\", a historical sketch of The Dalles. It caused quite a controversy in the region for its irreverence.\\nIn 1932, Davis was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. The award allowed him to move to Jalisco, Mexico, where he lived for two years, concentrating on his writing. There he completed the novel Honey in the Horn, about southern Oregon pioneer life. It is a coming-of-age tale set in the early twentieth century. This novel received the Harper Prize for best first novel of 1935, together with a $7,500 cash award. It was well reviewed by writers such as Robert Penn Warren, although New Yorker critic Clifton Fadiman did not like it. The following spring the book won the Pulitzer Prize, and is the only Pulitzer Prize ever awarded to an Oregon born author.[3] Davis did not go to New York to receive the Pulitzer in person, saying he did not want to put himself on exhibit.\\nThe Davises bought a small ranch near Napa, California currently owned by Aaron and Claire Pott and is the estate vineyard known as Châteauneuf du Pott.  There Davis wrote short stories as his primary source of income, publishing them in such magazines as Collier\\'s and The Saturday Evening Post. He continued to work on novels. His second novel, Harp of a Thousand Strings, appeared in 1941. The long interval from his Pulitzer-winning first novel meant that his second did not receive the notice it would have earlier. In fact, although Davis continued to improve as a writer, none of his later efforts received the attention of Honey in the Horn.\\nDavis was also undergoing crises in his life. He was divorced in 1943. He also changed publishers, from Harper & Brothers to William Morrow & Company, apparently because of a long-running dispute over royalty payments.\\nOver the next ten years, he published three more novels and a collection of earlier short stories. His fourth novel, Winds of Morning, was well received and became a Book of the Month Club selection. In 1953 he remarried, to Elizabeth Martin del Campo. As a result of arteriosclerosis, his left leg was amputated. He suffered chronic pain, but continued to write. In 1960 he died of a heart attack in San Antonio, Texas.[3]\\nAlthough often considered a regional novelist, Davis rejected that evaluation. He undoubtedly used regional themes, but contended that he did so in the service of the universal. Influences on his work can be found in a wide range of American and European literature. His prose is considered wry, ironic, and cryptic. His stories are realistic, without the romantic stereotypes expected of \"Western\" fiction. The landscape is a major component of his novels.\\n',\n",

He was known in his lifetime for his outspoken liberal views against Texas state politics, and he carried out a long, personal war against what he saw as braggart Texans, religious prejudice, restraints on individual liberty, and the mechanized world\\'s assault on the human spirit. He was instrumental in saving the Texas Longhorn breed of cattle from extinction.\\nJames Frank Dobie was born on a ranch in Live Oak County, Texas, and was the eldest of six children.[1][2][3] When he was young, his father Richard read to him from the Bible and his mother Ella read to him from books such as Ivanhoe and Pilgrim\\'s Progress. At 16, Dobie moved to Alice, the seat of Jim Wells County, Texas, where he lived with his grandparents and finished high school at William Adams High School.\\nIn 1906, Dobie enrolled in Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, where he was introduced to English poetry by a professor who urged him to become a writer. While in college he also met Bertha McKee (1890–1974), whom he married in 1916.[1][2][4][5]\\nAfter graduating in 1910, Dobie worked briefly for newspapers in San Antonio and Galveston before gaining his first teaching job at a high school in Alpine in southwestern Texas.[2] In 1911, he returned to Georgetown to teach at Southwestern Preparatory School.[6]\\nIn 1913, Dobie went to Columbia University to work on a master\\'s degree, and the next year, returned to Texas to join the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin.[1][2] He also became affiliated with the Texas Folklore Society.[4] In 1917, he left the university to serve in the field artillery in World War I.[1][2] He was briefly sent overseas at the end of the war and was discharged in 1919.[5]\\nDobie began to publish his first articles in 1919; by 1920 he was writing articles mostly about Longhorn cattle and life in the southwest. That year, he left the University of Texas faculty to work on his uncle\\'s ranch in La Salle County, north of Laredo,[1][2] where he developed a desire to write about Texas ranch life and southwestern folklore.[7][8][9]\\nAfter a year on the ranch, Dobie returned to UT and began to use its library and the Texas Folklore Society\\'s resources to write about the vanishing way of life on rural Texas ranches. In 1922, he became the Texas Folklore Society\\'s secretary and began a program for publication, holding the post of secretary-editor for 21 years. In 1923, unable to get a promotion without a PhD, Dobie accepted a job at Oklahoma A&M College as chair of its English department. While in Oklahoma, he wrote for the Country Gentleman. He returned to Austin in 1925 after receiving a token promotion with help from friends.[1][2][10]\\nIn 1929, Dobie published his first book, A Vaquero of the Brush Country,[4] which helped establish him as an authentic voice of Texas and southwestern culture.[1] While the title page said the book was \"Partly from the Reminiscences of John Young\", the author was given as J. Frank Dobie.[11] The book was the result of a collaboration between Dobie and Young, a former open-range vaquero who had fought against the encroachment of barbed wire on southwest Texas\\'s rangelands. Young had written Dobie for help in writing his autobiography, saying that he intended to use the profits from the book to build a hotel for cattlemen in San Antonio. Dobie agreed to help Young; he rearranged the raw material of Young\\'s reminiscences and rewrote it in the prose of historical writing.[12]\\nAlthough Lawrence Clark Powell, an authority on western writing at the University of California, wrote in the preface to the 1957 edition, \"it was unmistakably Dobie on every page, in every paragraph, sentence, and word\",[13] in 1994 Young\\'s heirs filed a petition with the U.S. District Court For the Western District Of Texas asserting that Young and Dobie coauthored the book. The matter of A Vaquero of the Brush Country\\'s authorship was ultimately resolved in this litigation between Young\\'s descendants, Dobie\\'s estate, and the University of Texas, holders of interests in the copyright. The court ruled that Young and Dobie are the joint authors of A Vaquero of the Brush Country.[14]\\nIn 1931, Dobie published Coronado\\'s Children, a collection of folklore about lost mines and lost treasures.[2] This was followed by a series of books in the 1930s. In 1941 he published The Longhorns,[2][4] a commercial and critical success that got a full-page review in The New York Times. It is considered one of the best descriptions of the traditions of the Texas Longhorn cattle breed during the 19th century. In 1932, UT named Dobie the first full professor not to possess a PhD[2]\\nIn 1937, Dobie was visiting Thomas Calloway Lea, Jr., a friend and prominent attorney in El Paso. After seeing Lea\\'s son Tom Lea\\'s artwork, Dobie asked the younger man to illustrate the book he was working on, Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver. Tom Lea also illustrated The Longhorns, as well as a biography of Texas pioneer John C. Duval. Dobie and Lea remained good friends for the rest of Dobie\\'s life.[15]\\nIn 1939, Dobie began publishing a Sunday newspaper column in which he routinely poked fun at Texas politics.[2] A liberal Democrat, he often found an easy target for his words in the antics of the state\\'s politicians. Of state politics, he once wrote, \"When I get ready to explain homemade fascism in America, I can take my example from the state capitol of Texas.\"[16]\\nDuring World War II, Dobie taught American history at Cambridge University,[17] and he took a leave of absence from the University of Texas to return to Europe after the war to teach in England, Germany, and Austria,[2][18] later writing of his experiences at Cambridge in A Texan in England.[2] When the UT Board of Regents fired President Homer Rainey for his liberal views, Dobie was outraged and made his views known publicly, causing Texas Governor Coke Stevenson to say that Dobie too should be dismissed. Dobie\\'s subsequent request for an extension of his leave of absence was rejected, and he was dismissed from UT in 1947.[2][19] After his dismissal, Dobie published another series of books and anthologies of stories about the open range.[2]\\nOn September 14, 1964, President Lyndon Johnson, a longtime political rival of Stevenson, awarded Dobie the Medal of Freedom.[2] Dobie died four days later.[1][2] His funeral was held in Hogg Auditorium at the University of Texas; he is interred at the Texas State Cemetery.[2][20]\\nIn 1965, Dobie was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.[21]\\nIn 1959, after a severe illness, Dobie sold his ranch in Marble Falls and bought a ranch 14 miles southwest of Austin, which he named \"Paisano\". He used the ranch as a writer\\'s retreat until his death in 1964. A movement to preserve the ranch promptly started, and longtime friend Ralph A. Johnston purchased the Paisano Ranch to take it off the market.[22] By 1966, he had transferred the deed to the University of Texas.[23] The university has said:\\nPaisano will be operated by the University as a permanent memorial to J. Frank Dobie, and the primary use will be to encourage creative artistic effort in all fields, particularly in writing. It will be kept in its present more or less natural state and the ranch house will be kept in simple style, very much as it was when Frank Dobie occupied it.Two fellowships of six months each are awarded by a committee chosen by the presidents of UT-Austin and the Texas Institute of Letters. The applicants must be native Texans, or Texas residents for at least two years, or persons whose writing is substantially identified with the state.[5]\\nMany of Dobie\\'s works are featured in Ramon Adams\\'s Six-Guns and Saddle Leather and The Rampaging Herd, two bibliographic works on the history of the American West and the cattle industry.\\n',\n",
       "  'Gary Martin Dobbs (born 1965, known by the pen name Jack Martin[1]) is a British writer and actor. He is known for a string of Western novels for Robert Hale\\'s Black Horse Western imprint, including Arkansas Smith, The Ballad of Delta Rose, and The Afterlife of Slim McCord. In 2016 a digital edition of Tarnished Star was issued by Piccadilly Publishing under the alternative title of LawMaster. The title change refers to the title used for the script by Neil Jones and Gary Dobbs which is optioned for a feature film.\\nDobbs is the writer of the series of mysteries featuring the character of Granny Smith. As an actor Dobbs has appeared (often uncredited) in many British TV shows, as well as in the films The Reverend and Risen. In 2014 Dobbs wrote the 2013 non-fiction historical book, Cardiff and the Valleys in the Great War, published by Pen and Sword Books. Other non-fiction works include Dark Valleys (2016), Cardiff at War 1939–1945 (2018) and A Date with the Hangman: A history of capital punishment.\\nGary Martin Dobbs was born in 1965 in South Wales to Horace Dobbs and Violet (Martin) Dobbs. His early life was spent in the one-time coal-mining village of Gilfach Goch. His adolescence was, in his own words, idyllic with his love of reading and eventually writing instilled in him by his mother who, after discovering he was a poor reader, sat him down and taught him to read. In an interview with BBC Radio Wales, Dobbs stated, \"I was eleven years old at the time. And it was the best thing anyone ever did for me. As soon as I conquered the act of reading the written word a whole new world opened for me.\"\\nDobbs wrote his first novel at fifteen years of age, which went unpublished, but it was an experience he never forgot and has been writing ever since. Dobbs has claimed that being born into a working class area, and educated at the local comprehensive school, he was denied encouragement by the education system and owes his love of literature to his mother and grandfather, Jack Martin. It was his grandfather\\'s name that Dobbs used as a pen-name for his string of best-selling western novels published first by Robert Hale Ltd and then by Crowood Press.[2]\\n',\n",
       "  'Ivan Doig (/ˈaɪvən ˈdɔɪɡ/; June 27, 1939 – April 9, 2015) was an American author and novelist, widely known for his sixteen fiction and non-fiction books set mostly in his native Montana, celebrating the landscape and people of the post-war American West.\\nWith settings ranging from the Rocky Mountain Front to Alaska\\'s coast, Puget Sound and Oregon, the Chicago Tribune noted in 1987 that Doig wrote of \"immigrant families, dedicated schoolteachers, miners, fur trappers, town builders\"[1] and of \"the uncertainties of friendship and love, and colossal battles of will, set amid the vast unpredictabilities of a land noted for sudden deadly floods, agonizing droughts, blizzards and forest fires.\"[1] Doig himself would later say \"I come from the lariat proletariat, the working-class point of view.\"[2] In particular, Doig \"believed that ordinary people deserve to have their stories told\".[3] This House of Sky: Landscapes of a Western Mind, Doig\\'s 1977 memoir, was finalist for the National Book Award for Contemporary Thought. In 2007 Doig won the University of Colorado\\'s Center of the American West\\'s Wallace Stegner Award.[2] Doig\\'s 2006 novel The Whistling Season became a New York Times best-seller. He won the Western Literature Association\\'s lifetime Distinguished Achievement award[2] and held the distinction of the only living author with works of both fiction and non-fiction listed in the top 12 of the San Francisco Chronicle poll of best books of the 20th century.[4] Doig\\'s life and his works are the focus of the documentary film by Montana PBS and 4:08 productions, Ivan Doig: Landscapes of a Western Mind. \\nIn 2006, Sven Birkerts described Doig as \"a presiding figure in the literature of the American West.\"[2]\\nI don\\'t think of myself as a \\'Western\\' writer\". To me, language—the substance on the page, that poetry under the prose—is the ultimate \\'region,\\' the true home, for a writer.\\nIf I have any creed that I wish you as readers, necessary accomplices in this flirtatious ceremony of writing and reading, will take with you from my pages, it\\'d be this belief of mine that writers of caliber can ground their work in specific land and lingo and yet be writing of that larger country: life.Doig was born in White Sulphur Springs, Montana[5] to Charles \"Charlie\" Doig, ranch hand and Berneta Ringer Doig.[5]  After the death of his mother on his sixth birthday, he was raised briefly (1947 - 1949) by his father and his father\\'s second wife, Fern White, who had been hired as a ranch cook, and later by his father and his maternal grandmother, Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Ringer. [6] Doig moved with his father and grandmother on a series of jobs, the ranch equivalent of sharecropping, subsequently moving to Dupuyer, Montana to herd sheep close to the Rocky Mountain Front. As a child, Doig read comics, sports pages and magazines like Life, Colliers and The Saturday Evening Post.[7]\\nDoig graduated salutatorian in a class of 21 students from Valier High School in Valier, Montana.[2][8] He won a full-tuition scholarship to Northwestern University, where he earned a bachelor\\'s degree in 1961 and a master\\'s degree in journalism in 1962.[9] His master\\'s thesis was on the subject of televised congressional hearings on organized crime.[1] He later earned a Ph.D. in American history at the University of Washington, writing his dissertation on John J. McGilvra (1827–1903).[10]\\nImportant first-hand influences on his writing included his high school English and Latin teacher, Frances Tidyman; Sam Jamison, who taught him reporting at Northwestern; and Ben Baldwin, who taught him broadcast news.[7]\\nAfter he earned his degree in 1962, Doig was drafted into the Air Force Reserve. He was released from active duty in 1963.[9] Doig lived with his wife Carol Doig, née Muller, a university professor of English, in Seattle, Washington until his death from multiple myeloma in 2015.[11]\\nHe was related to Fully Informed Jury Association co-founder, Don Doig.[12]\\nBefore becoming a novelist, Doig wrote for newspapers and magazines as a free-lancer and worked for the United States Forest Service.  Doig served as an editorial writer for the Lindsay-Schaub newspaper chain in Decatur, Illinois,[1] and served as assistant editor of The Rotarian magazine in Evanston, Illinois.[4]\\nThe western landscape and people play an important role in Doig\\'s fiction, with much of it set in the Montana country of his youth. His major theme is family life in the past, mixing personal memory and regional history. The first three Montana novels—English Creek, Dancing at the Rascal Fair, and Ride with Me, Mariah Montana—form the \"McCaskill trilogy\", covering the first century of Montana statehood from 1889 to 1989.\\nIvan met his future wife, Carol Muller, at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University[13] while the two were students. They married on April 17, 1965.[14] The two did not have any children.[9] Carol assisted Ivan in writing and editing his books[15] and was a longtime professor of journalism.[3]\\nIn 2001, Ivan was diagnosed with MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance). In 2006, he was diagnosed with “smoldering myeloma,” which can remain dormant for years. In November, doctors told Ivan that his high levels of proteins meant that his myeloma was progressing.[14] Ivan kept a detailed record of his medical journey in journals now held by Montana State University in the Ivan Doig archive.[16] He died from multiple myeloma on April 9, 2015.[14]\\nIn October 2015, Carol Doig donated her husband\\'s extensive holding of notes, photos and records of his writing to the Montana State University Library Merrill G. Burlingame Special Collections.[17]  Montana State University was chosen over offers from Stanford University and the University of Washington[17] based in part on the MSU Library\\'s promise to digitize the entire collection in less than one year and make it available on a public website, as well as on MSU\\'s proximity to Doig\\'s childhood home and the encouragement of Montana authors Rick Bass, Tom McGuane and Jamie Ford.\\nThe Ivan Doig digital collection consists of manuscripts, proofs and galleys, typed and handwritten writing fragments, pocket notebooks, note cards, diaries, journals, photographs, audio/visual material, and memorabilia created or collected by Ivan Doig. The material has been described archivally.[18] The physical collection is preserved within Montana State University Library\\'s Merrill G.

       "  '\\nJohn Thomas Edson (17 February 1928 – 17 July 2014) was an English author of 137 Westerns, escapism adventure, and police-procedural novels. He lived near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, from the 1950s onwards, and retired from writing due to ill-health in 2005.[1]\\nHe was born in February 1928 near the border of Derbyshire in a small mining village, Whitwell.[2] Both his grandfathers and assorted uncles were coalminers[3] His paternal family was native to Whitwell, his paternal grandfather Herbert Edson, being born in the hamlet of Steetley, near Whitwell. His maternal grandfather, Robert Gill, was born in Heeley, Yorkshire.\\nHis parents married at Whitwell Parish Church of St. Lawrence on 5 April 1926, and John Thomas (J.T.) Edson (junior) was their first child. In June 1928 the Edson family suffered a sudden bereavement when 7-year-old John Vincent Edson, the young son of John Edson\\'s namesake cousin John R Edson, died suddenly; a month later, John Thomas Edson himself also died in July 1928, leaving Eliza a 23-year-old widow with a six-month-old baby son. Eliza Edson remarried in 1946 when J.T. Edson was 18 years old.  \\nJ. T. Edson joined the British Army at the age of 18 years in 1946. Edson served in the army for 12 years as a Dog Trainer.[2] He saw active service in Korea and Africa.[4]\\nCooped up in barracks for long periods, he read books by escapist writers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert McCraig, Nelson C. Nye and Edgar Wallace. He also watched films starring John Wayne, Randolph Scott, Errol Flynn and his all-time favourite, Audie Murphy. His first published work was \"Hints on Self-Preservation when attacked by a War Dog\" in the Osnabrück camp magazine Shufti in 1947.  Acquiring a typewriter in the early 1950s and putting it to good use while posted to Hong Kong, by the time of his discharge he had written 10 Westerns, an early version of Bunduki and the first of the short detective-type stories starring Waco.\\nEdson decided to leave the Army on his marriage and as he and his wife began to raise their six children, he sought to turn his hobby of writing into an income to support his family. He won second prize (with Trail Boss, first published in 1961) in the Western division of a literary competition run by Brown & Watson Ltd, which led to the publication of 46 novels with them, becoming a major source of revenue for the company. He sometimes needed additional income and also worked as a postman, and was the proprietor of a fish and chip shop. He branched out as a writer and wrote five series of short stories (Dan Hollick, Dog Handler) for the Victor boys\\' paper,[2] and wrote the box captions for comic strips, which instilled discipline and the ability to convey maximum information with minimum words.\\nHis writing career forged ahead when he joined Corgi Books in the late 1960s, which gave Edson exposure through a major publishing house, as well as the opportunity to branch out from Westerns into the Rockabye County, the science-fiction hero Bunduki[5] and other series.\\nAt his most prolific, Edson wrote a new novel every six to eight weeks.[citation needed]\\nEdson openly claimed, though rather tongue-in-cheek, that he wrote for the money.[2] In an article for Time magazine in February 1999, he declared that unlike such authors as Louis L\\'Amour, he had \"no desire to have lived in the Wild West, and I\\'ve never even been on a horse. I\\'ve seen those things and they look highly dangerous at both ends and bloody uncomfortable in the middle.\"\\nThis remoteness from the West placed Edson in company with the popular Western author Zane Grey, who was a middle-aged east coast dentist. Similarly, Western author George G. Gilman, real name Terry Harknett, was born and bred in Essex, England.\\n\\nJ. T. Edson delighted in using real-life and fictional characters as crossover \"guest stars\" in his works and often used the relatives/descendants of his characters to create spin-off series.  He backs the existence of these guest stars with frequent references to \"fictionist-genealogist\" Philip José Farmer\\'s Wold Newton family.\\nHis first hero, Ole Devil, is the maternal uncle of his Civil War & Floating Outfit hero, Dusty Fog. Fog in turn is the first cousin of gunfighter John Wesley Hardin. Lon Ysabel\\'s cousin is \"Bad Bill\" Longley. Alvin Fog was Dusty\\'s grandson; Rockabye County hero Bradford Counter was Mark Counter\\'s great-grandson, and Bunduki was Bradford Counter\\'s cousin and another great-grandson of Mark Counter, his mater Dawn Drummond-Clayton being the great-granddaughter of Tarzan through their son, Jack Clayton, aka Korak the Killer. Alvin Fog shares his series with Edgar Wallace characters J G Reeder and the Three Just Men. A variety of real (Wyatt Earp) and fictional (Matt Dillon) characters pop up in every series.\\nThe huge procession of characters from book to book ensured that the first few pages of an Edson book always ended up looking alike, with descriptions of a small, insignificant looking Dusty Fog, who suddenly appeared to become a giant when villains he faced down felt the full force of his personality, the tall and Greek-god handsome Mark Counter, the baby-faced but highly dangerous, black dressed, rifle and bowie knife toting Ysabel Kid, and various other characters. Western critic Ray Merlock has lauded Edson for his characterisation of these\\nthree heroes.[2]\\nEdson\\'s books avoided explicit sex and graphic violence; they also advocated right-wing political views.[2] Edson also avoiding having \"losers\" and anti-heroes as protagonists.[2] Merlock stated:\\n\"Edson\\'s strength as a Western writer is that he loves his main characters...His villains are stereotyped, his plots usually familiar, but his emphasis on his three, rather pleasant leading characters is the basis for his understandable popularity\".[2]\\nDusty (Dustine Edward Marsden Fog) is the principal protagonist in most of the Floating Outfit stories and Civil War stories. Short[6] but strongly built for his height, Dusty is exceptionally fast with his twin Colts and commonly considered the fastest gun in Texas, a skilled rifle shot though usually preferring a Winchester carbine as being more suited to his small stature, and unequalled in hand-to-hand combat either unarmed or with a sabre. Dusty adapts his talents to the situation whether as head of a cattle drive (e.g. in Trail Boss), light cavalry commander (e.g. in Kill Dusty Fog!), lawman (e.g. in The Town Tamers), wagon train boss (Wagons to Backsight) or spy (e.g. as assistant to Belle Boyd in The Rebel Spy), and his wide education from a variety of teachers renders him a shrewd solver of mysteries and fraud (one example is given in \"A Wife for Dusty Fog\" in The Small Texan). Although well able to fight in the normal manner for a Western saloon brawl, Dusty is extensively trained in judo and karate by Tommy Okasi. Dusty is a capable cattleman and knows few equals as a horseman, successfully breaking and later using as his regular mount a paint stallion that crippled Ole Devil when he tried to ride it. In the earlier part of his career Dusty uses twin Model 1860 Army Colts but acquires a pair of Civilian Model P Colts in The Peacemakers, finding them much to his liking and conferring a slight improvement in his draw speed and marksmanship.\\nMark is Dusty\\'s right-hand man in many Floating Outfit stories and the principal protagonist in a few (e.g. Rangeland Hercules). Much taller and heavier than Dusty (about six feet three inches and 210 pounds), Mark is seldom acknowledged as even having an equal for size and strength, although Dusty may be slightly stronger pound for pound.[7] Rarely some third party is mentioned as having been capable of equalling one of Mark\\'s feats of strength (one instance is in The Fortune Hunters, but was sabotaged and led to the crippling of the other man). Lacking Dusty\\'s knowledge of Oriental martial arts, Mark adopts a more conventional albeit comparatively modern boxing style taught to him by Sailor Sam, who worked as Mark\\'s father\\'s cook, and is only ever beaten when badly outnumbered. Mark is almost as fast with his Colts as is Dusty, preferring Cavalry Peacemakers when these become available as replacements for his earlier Army Colts. Mark is invariably stated to be an even better cattleman than Dusty although deferring to him on cattle drives, and also an expert with either rifle or sabre although he concedes Dusty\\'s superiority with either weapon. Also a shrewd lawman, Mark generally works as Dusty\\'s deputy on such occasions. Since Mark is tall, strong and handsome (and a leader of Confederate Army fashions during the Civil War) Mark is often mistaken for Dusty by those who know the latter only by his very strong reputation, which confusion the Floating Outfit occasionally use to their advantage when it helps for Dusty to remain incognito for a while. Also an exceptional horseman, Mark rides a \"huge\" bloodbay stallion throughout his career with the Floating Outfit. Mark\\'s good looks and Southern charm bring him many romantic conquests although he is principled enough to steer clear of innocents and is strongly averse to married women.\\nLon (Loncey Dalton Ysabel; also \"Cuchilo\", the Knife, among the Comanche; or \"Cabrito\", literally \"little he-goat\" and hence a synonym for one meaning of the English word \"Kid\", to Spanish-speakers) is the third member of the principal triumvirate of the Floating Outfit stories. Half Kentucky Irish, one-quarter French Creole and one-quarter Comanche, Loncey was raised as a member of his grandfather\\'s \"Dog Soldier\" Lodge and received Comanche training until adolescence. Because of this he is fully the equal of any full-blood Indian in skills such as stealth and tracking, speaks several Indian languages and can communicate in sign language, and is an expert horse-rider and trainer. His personal mount is an exceptionally fierce white stallion named, with deliberate irony, \"Nigger\" (\"Blackie\" in some editions) which he trained as a boy. Nigger is unusually well trained, able to warn his master of ambushers, unmatched in speed and endurance, and a proven man-killer that will attack on command.[8] Only close associates are able to handle Nigger and then only to the bare minimum necessary. Less of a revolver-fighter than most of the Floating Outfit, the Kid uses a single Dragoon Colt with some skill but would only be considered fast by those unused to the West; however, he is fond of his obsolescent revolver for its brutal hitting power and when he does shoot someone with it they are usually killed or maimed by a single hit. At close quarters the Kid is second to none with a Bowie knife and at longer ranges he is a phenomenal rifle shot. When encountered in The Ysabel Kid, Loncey is using a carbine-stocked Dragoon Colt faut de mieux as a long gun, his muzzle-loading rifle having recently been destroyed, but later in the story he acquires a brass-framed \"Yellow Boy\" Winchester 1866 with which he rapidly becomes expert. When this weapon too is destroyed some years later, in Gun Wizard, the Kid succeeds in winning a \"One of a Thousand\" Winchester 1873 which he finds a still superior weapon. Rarely, the Kid yields the palm to a specialised sharpshooter with a target-sighted rifle (Wagons to Backsight), but otherwise he is as famous for his skill with a rifle as Dusty is with a Colt. Having spent his late adolescence as a smuggler on the US/Mexico border, the Kid has contacts on both sides of the law in Mexico and knows the Spanish spoken by bandits or hidalgos alike.\\nWaco (birth name unknown; so named because as an infant he survived a Waco Indian massacre) becomes the fourth regular member of the Floating Outfit when he encounters Dusty Fog as an angry young man.[9] Being already a fast-draw gunfighter with several kills behind him, Waco picks a fight with Dusty only to find that Dusty can not only beat him to the draw but have enough margin of victory to hold his fire, which he does because of Waco\\'s resemblance to his recently murdered brother Danny Fog. Waco almost at once picks a second fight with Mark, which is interrupted when the herd Waco is helping to drive stampedes. Waco then redeems himself in the eyes of Dusty and Mark when he mercy-kills his injured horse rather than let it be trampled by the cattle, gravely risking his own life to do it, and is successfully rescued by Dusty. Owing Dusty his life, Waco soon tries to repay the favour when the Floating Outfit are ambushed, though as it turns out Dusty and Waco each save the other. From then on Waco idolises Dusty and eagerly joins him when his employer, Clay Allison, offers him the chance, knowing that he himself is a poor role-model for the young man. Over time he learns law work from Dusty, brawling from Mark whom he grows to almost match in stature, and tracking from the Kid. He later becomes a lawman independently from the Floating Outfit, first as an Arizona Ranger, then as the sheriff of Two Forks County in Utah, and eventually (by the time of Hound Dog Man) a United States Marshal. He is nearly the equal of his illustrious teachers in each respect, as well as learning about crooked gambling from Frank Derringer. Originally using a pair of 1860 Army Colts, Waco adopts Artillery Peacemakers in The Peacemakers and, on a trip to Chicago (in Waco\\'s Debt) Waco is introduced to the Winchester Model 1876 \"Centennial\" rifle, liking its superior range and hitting power. Waco rides a paint stallion, formerly part of Clay Allison\\'s remuda, clearly as a tribute to Dusty\\'s own paint and also named after Dusty. At the conclusion of The Drifter, Waco is about to marry rancher Beth Morrow.\\nDoc (Marvin Elldridge Leroy) is so known because he was a medical student before family concerns forced him to abandon his studies and earn his living as a cowhand. He is able and willing to put his medical knowledge to good use on the trail, delivering several babies, treating gunshot and other wounds, setting bones, and on one occasion (\"Statute of Limitations\" in Sagebrush Sleuth) caring for a small mining town that has fallen victim to typhoid. Although it is widely reputed that Leroy once performed an emergency appendectomy with a Bowie knife, Doc Leroy M.D. reveals that this is only cowhand legend and he in fact carries and uses bona fide surgical instruments. During his early career as a cowhand Leroy rode with the Wedge, a contract trail-driving crew led by Stone Hart, but he later transfers to the O.D. Connected. Unlike Dusty, Mark and Waco, Leroy uses only a single revolver (an Army Colt, and later an ivory-handled Civilian Peacemaker) but, as mentioned in Doc Leroy M.D. and The Drifter, he is slightly faster with this single gun than Dusty is with his pair. Leroy later joins Waco in serving as an Arizona Ranger before finally receiving the chance to finish qualifying for his medical degree. By this time he has married Lynn Baker, actually Beth Morrow\\'s sister (the two were brought up estranged and in separate households before learning of each other\\'s existence) and so become Waco\\'s brother-in-law.\\nRed is so named for the colour of his hair, and even Ole Devil Hardin typically refers to him by that nickname. A cousin of Dusty\\'s, Red also serves in the Confederate army during the Civil War as a non-commissioned officer, fighting bravely and with skill. After the War he becomes a member of the O. D. Connected ranch crew and an occasional member of the Floating Outfit. Red is noted for his temper and hot-headedness but when given independent responsibility adopts a more serious and thoughtful approach. Only in the Ysabel Kid\\'s class with a revolver, Red is good albeit not exceptional with his .56-calibre Spencer carbine, a large-calibre weapon that tends to command respect, and proves well able (in Waco\\'s Debt) to make good use of an obsolete Kentucky long rifle. A competent cowhand who rides a claybank stallion, Red enjoys a fair fight with bare hands and has more skill than most having been trained by Mark Counter. Red meets Sue Ortega during the events of Wagons to Backsight and is about to marry her at the end of the book.\\nOle Devil (Jackson Baines Hardin) is Dusty\\'s uncle, known as \"Ole Devil\" partly because his angular features, dark beard and hair (the latter tending to form tufts that resemble horns) lend him an appearance similar to traditional depictions of Satan, and partly because his youthful adventurousness and aggression earned him the reputation of being a \"real ole devil\" for a fight. In his youth Hardin was involved in several adventures concerned with Texas\\'s drive for independence from Mexico, and later he was commissioned as a general in the Confederate States Army where he was considered an extremely able commander. After the War Hardin returned to his \"O.D. Connected\" ranch intending to devote himself to the cattle business which he, along with a number of like-minded men, viewed as Texas\\'s best immediate prospect for economic recovery, but he suffered an irreparable spinal injury when thrown by a horse he was considering buying and spent the rest of his life confined to a wheelchair. He continued to rule the O.D. Connected with a stern but fair hand, relying on the Floating Outfit to carry out his wishes and often sending them to the aid of friends or relatives who had need of their talents. Despite his sternness, Hardin has a soft spot for his granddaughter Betty Hardin, and occasionally shows a keen humour and generosity to the young men he normally treats severely, such as when, having scolded Red Blaze for his gaudy neckwear, Hardin rewards him for a job well done with a still more outlandish silk bandana that he had bought for himself as a young man (\"Cousin Red\\'s Big Chance\" in The Hard Riders). Although formerly having been in arms against Mexico, Hardin retains many important friends south of the border, including even one (Don Ruiz Villaneuva, in The Peacemakers) who fought on the Mexican side at the siege of the Alamo. His eventual death is reported at the conclusion of Doc Leroy M. D..\\nTommy (real forename unknown) is Ole Devil\\'s companion in his earlier adventures, and his manservant during the Civil War and afterwards. An exiled samurai who has fled Japan over some unexplained disagreement with a powerful shogun, Tommy is a master of typical samurai weapons such as sword and bow (his sword is stated to be a tachi rather than a katana although the former type of sword had not been made since the 1500s (European calendar)) as well as ju-jitsu and karate. Tommy serves Ole Devil loyally and well, settling generally peacefully into American society although having to correct some individuals who take him for a meek Chinese immigrant who can be bullied with impunity. When in company with the young Ole Devil, Tommy shows a quirky sense of humour that lends itself to \"Confucius Say...\" jokes, though instead of attributing them to the famous Chinese philosopher Tommy prefaces them with \"Ancient and wise Japanese saying, which I\\'ve just made up...\". Tommy teaches ju-jitsu and karate to both Dusty Fog and Betty Hardin, allowing them both a useful edge over much larger and stronger men for their own safety. When of comparatively advanced age (in Sidewinder) Tommy is still fit and strong, and in regular practice, enough to be capable of feats of tameshiwari that astonish a captured Waw\\'ai Comanche warrior.\\nCalamity (Martha Jane Canary) is acknowledged by the author not to be the historical character of that name.[10] As presented in the books, she is a young woman in her late teens or early twenties who fled a convent school to join a freight-driving crew led by Dobe Killem. Initially she made herself useful by stepping in for their drunken cook, but soon learned how to manage a team of heavy horses, fight with a whip, and shoot competently with either a .36-calibre Navy Colt or a Winchester carbine (both chosen to suit her smaller, less muscular frame). She has several adventures of her own in addition to intermittently associating with the Floating Outfit. While enjoying an on-off physical relationship with Mark Counter, it is mutually understood that they are only what a later century would call \"Friends with benefits\", and she enjoys other male company routinely, including on one occasion the Ysabel Kid (in White Stallion, Red Mare). In addition to her freight-driving skills, Calamity is a tough fist-fighter who is almost never beaten by a woman – not even a trained prize-fighter billed as the World Champion – and makes good use of Indian-style medicine learned from a Pawnee wise-woman (including an effective contraceptive method also known by Belle Starr, mentioned in Guns in the Night). Although hot-headed and prone to both speak and act without thinking, Calamity is brave and determined, and regarded with affection by the Floating Outfit even as they wait for the trouble to start.\\nBetty is Ole Devil\\'s favourite granddaughter who runs the Hardin household with firm but fair discipline and whose orders are never questioned even when they restrict Ole Devil himself (in The Ysabel Kid, Tommy Okasi informs Hardin that Betty\\'s orders bar him from drinking burgundy during the daytime). Although a good-looking, well-educated and gently-bred Southern girl, Betty possesses a strong streak of independence and has both the inclination and the aptitude to hunt stock-killing cougar backed only by a team of her own hounds. Betty also carries a Merwin Hulbert revolver in a concealed shoulder clip and is nearly as expert with ju-jitsu as Dusty is; in Rio Hondo War, Betty shows her ability by trapping Dusty in a submission hold that he could only have broken using a more dangerous counter than he was willing to use, and in McGraw\\'s Inheritance she uses a throw to discourage a drunken cowhand from taking liberties with her. On another occasion, Betty successfully cows an inexperienced outlaw gang by sheer force of personality, such that by the time she is rescued her kidnappers are willing to admit that they would likely have ended up paying Ole Devil Hardin to take her back. Also in Rio Hondo War, Betty rescues Johnny Raybold from a murderous ambush, and the two soon become attracted to each other, not least over a shared interest in hunting; by the end of the story, Ole Devil has granted permission for the two to marry.\\nOne of the features of J.T.Edson\\'s writing is his willingness to write stories which conflict with previous books.  Most of the \"expansions\" do not just add features to the original story but actually change the original story.  Edson explains it thus:  \"When supplying us with the information from which we produce our books, one of the strictest rules imposed upon us by the present-day members of what we call the \\'Hardin, Fog and Blaze\\' clan and the \\'Counter\\' family is that we never under any circumstances disclose their true identities or their current whereabouts.  Furthermore, we are instructed to always include sufficient inconsistencies to ensure that neither can happen inadvertently\".\\nThe most striking inconsistency surrounds Dusty Fog and Freddie Woods.  Dusty and Freddie meet in The Trouble Busters (published 1965) when Dusty takes on as Town Marshal for a few weeks. They meet subsequently from time-to-time (e.g. Buffalo are Coming, The Fortune Hunters) when Dusty was in Kansas with trail herds etc. and become increasingly close, culminating in Dusty pondering marriage in Guns in the Night (last book in Floating Outfit series) at the end of which he decides to settle down and \"send for Freddie\".  Notwithstanding these previously published books, it turns out in Decision for Dusty Fog (published in 1986) that Dusty and Freddie were actually married in Mulrooney when Dusty was marshal, a few weeks after they first met.\\nJT notes also Dusty\\'s romantic links with Belle Boyd, Candy Carde and Emma Nene in various Floating Outfit novels and apologises in The Code of Dusty Fog for \\'creating the misconception\\'.\\nAfter being enormously prolific through the 1970s, culminating in the publication of JT\\'s Hundredth in 1979, his style began to gradually change.  His plots became simpler (e.g., Beguinage / Beguinage is Dead) and his previously thorough approach to detail became even more so.  In many cases, a fight scene that would have lasted 10 seconds ran over many pages.\\nJT\\'s political beliefs became more and more prominent in his writings, to summarise a few:\\nThere is a huge difference between the pace and complexity of the plots of Trail Boss (1963) and Diamonds, Emeralds, Cards and Colts (1986).  To illustrate the point, he began revising, changing and expanding previously published short stories and publishing them as full novels (sometimes 2 novels):\\nDespite selling over 27 million books globally and producing over 100 books, his books fell out of favour with UK publishers and from the 1990s were only published in the USA.\\nTowards the 1990s as his health began to fail, as well as the expansions, he primarily wrote \"fill in the gaps\" books or anthologies of short stories about characters. The last J T Edson book available in the UK, Mark Counter\\'s Kin, was an anthology. However, he also wrote and published the first three in a quartet of new books designed to fill in what happened to Dusty Fog, Mark Counter and Lon Ysabel as they made their way home to the OD Connected after the events of the Floating Outfit title Return to Backsight (which Edson used as a springboard to launch his Waco series): Wedge Goes To Arizona, Arizona Range War and Arizona Gun Law are only available via American bookstores, as is his long-promised \"Belle Boyd\"-centric novel, Mississippi Raider (also a new work). The final book in the quartet, Arizona Takeover, was apparently not published.\\nHe eventually decided to semi-retire by 1999 but didn\\'t stop writing.Hw would often come up with plots at his local Public House. However, by 2005, his failing health forced him to retire from writing, frustrating him as he had been unable to complete the five tie-up titles for his respective series, including Miz Freddie of Kansas which was to have been an anthology of supposed anecdotes and reminiscences being told directly to the reader by Freddie Fog née Woods, as an aged octogenarian, with one story being how Dusty, Mark and Lon, his three primary protagonists, were killed fighting Mau Mau terrorists in Kenya in 1911. However, many years of active, manual work involving a lot of movement, such as postman and café owner, had caused him severe joint problems, as had the cumulative effect of long hours hunched over a heavy old manual typewriter in cold, draughty barracks, and a yo-yo weight problem caused by an underlying medical condition.\\nHis American publishers Dell and later HarperCollins began to periodically reissue his books, though they changed the titles of some books.  Title changes were as follows:\\nMiz Freddie of Kansas, an anthology of anecdotes related by the octogenarian widow of Dusty Fog in which, so Edson promised, would be revealed details of how Dusty, Mark and Lon were killed together in Kenya, Africa in 1911.\\nJ T Edson had had 137 books published and had sold over 27 million copies globally. J T Edson has at least one complete, unpublished novel, Amazons of Zillikian, which was #5 in the Bunduki series, but which remained unpublished due to his disillusion with the intransigence of the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate, as mentioned by Laurence Dunn in his online article.[11] In November 2023, Piccadilly Publishing published Amazons of Zillikian.[12]\\nDuring 1994, two made for TV films were produced, Guns of Honor, based on The Ysabel Kid and Wanted: Belle Starr[13] and Trigger Fast, an adaptation of the novel of the same name,[14] which were loosely based on the Floating Outfit series. Starring Christopher Atkins as Dusty Fog and Martin Sheen as Ol Devil Hardin, the two films were produced in South Africa.[15]\\nFor many years from the 1950s – 1970s J T Edson\\'s books were hugely popular. However, in the 1980s he increasingly clashed with UK publishers over his books\\' treatment and portrayal of racial politics and issues in the post-Civil War Southern\\nStates.[citation needed] Perhaps because of his experiences in the British Army, Edson developed a deep disapproval of Liberal and Liberal-Radical politics and was avowedly Right of Centre in his political ideology.\\nJ T Edson\\'s treatment of racial politics and issues in the post-Civil War South dealt with potentially controversial issues. His novel, The Hooded Riders, portrayed a Ku Klux Klan like organisation as a heroic resistance group.[1] His heroes, Dusty Fog and Mark Counter, are responsible for founding this group; however, the group is formed to deal with a specific emergency (an attempt to seize land from North Texas ranchers and farmers to control key land routes and cripple Texas\\' cattle exports) and is permanently dissolved once the antagonist has been brought to justice. Moreover, Dusty Fog himself speaks disparagingly of the Klan[16] and plainly has no affection for it. The same novel also portrays the outlaw and gunfighter John Wesley Hardin as a wrongly accused hero, and his killing of a black man is presented as self-defence.[17] The novel also refers to Reconstruction as a \"period of stupidity and bigotry\" directed against white Southerners.[18] In other novels, Edson refers to black slaves in the South who came to the defence of their masters against Northerners.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nEdward Sylvester Ellis (April 11, 1840 – June 20, 1916) was an American author.[1][2]\\nEllis was a teacher, school administrator, journalist, and the author of hundreds of books and magazine articles[3]  that he produced by his name and by a number of pen names. Notable fiction stories by Ellis include The Steam Man of the Prairies[4] and Seth Jones, or the Captives of the Frontier.[5] Internationally, Edward S. Ellis is probably known best for his Deerfoot novels read widely by young boys until the 1950s.\\nSeth Jones was a prototypical early dime novel published by Beadle and Adams.[6] It is said that Seth Jones was one of Abraham Lincoln\\'s favorite stories.[7] During the mid-1880s, after a fiction-writing career of some thirty years, Ellis eventually began composing more serious works of biography, history, and persuasive writing.  Of note was \"The Life of Colonel David Crockett\", which had the story of Davy Crockett giving a speech usually called \"Not Yours To Give\".  It was a speech in opposition to awarding money to a Navy widow on the grounds that Congress had no Constitutional mandate to give charity.  It was said to have been inspired by Crockett\\'s meeting with a Horatio Bunce, a much quoted man in Libertarian circles, but one for whom historical evidence is non-existent.\\nBesides the one hundred fifty-nine books published by his own name, Ellis\\' work was published under various pseudonyms, including:[1]\\nfamous american naval commanders 1899 by edwards . ellis\\nEllis\\' best known books follow the adventures of Deerfoot of the Shawnee, a young Native American brave based on the historical character of the same name who was renowned for his skill with the bow, and his abilities as a runner.[9]\\nThis series introduces the characters Oskar Relstaub and Jack Carleton. Deerfoot appears in the second and third books.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nKaren Louise Erdrich (/ˈɜːrdrɪk/ ER-drik;[2] born June 7, 1954)[3] is a Native American author of novels, poetry, and children\\'s books featuring Native American characters and settings. She is an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians of North Dakota, a federally recognized tribe of Ojibwe people.[4][1]\\nErdrich is widely acclaimed as one of the most significant writers of the second wave of the Native American Renaissance. She has written 28 books in all, including fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and children\\'s books. In 2009, her novel The Plague of Doves was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and received an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.[5] In November 2012, she received the National Book Award for Fiction for her novel The Round House.[6] She is a 2013 recipient of the Alex Awards. She was awarded the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction at the National Book Festival in September 2015.[7] In 2021, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel The Night Watchman.[8]\\nShe was married to author Michael Dorris and the two collaborated on a number of works. The couple separated in 1995 and then divorced in 1996; Dorris would also take his own life in 1997 as allegations that he sexually abused at least three of the daughters whom he raised with Erdrich were under investigation.[9][10][11]\\nShe is also the owner of Birchbark Books, a small independent bookstore in Minneapolis that focuses on Native American literature and the Native community in the Twin Cities.[12]\\nErdrich was born on June 7, 1954, in Little Falls, Minnesota. She was the oldest of seven children born to Ralph Erdrich, a German-American, and Rita (née Gourneau), a Chippewa woman (of half Ojibwe and half French blood).[13] Both parents taught at a boarding school in Wahpeton, North Dakota, set up by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Erdrich\\'s maternal grandfather, Patrick Gourneau, served as tribal chairman for the federally recognized tribe of Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians for many years.[14] Though not raised in a reservation, she often visited relatives there.[15] She was raised \"with all the accepted truths\" of Catholicism.[15]\\nWhile Erdrich was a child, her father paid her a nickel for every story she wrote. Her sister Heidi became a poet and also lives in Minnesota; she publishes under the name Heid E. Erdrich.[16] Another sister, Lise Erdrich, has written children\\'s books and collections of fiction and essays.[17]\\nErdrich attended Dartmouth College from 1972 to 1976.[18] She was a part of the first class of women admitted to the college and earned a B.A. in English. During her first year, Erdrich met Michael Dorris, an anthropologist, writer, and then-director of the new Native American Studies program. While attending Dorris\\' class, she began to look into her own ancestry, which inspired her to draw from it for her literary work, such as poems, short stories, and novels.  During that time, she worked as a lifeguard, waitress, researcher for films,[19] and as an editor for the Boston Indian Council newspaper The Circle.[15]\\nIn 1978, Erdrich enrolled in a Master of Arts program at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. She earned the Master of Arts in the Writing Seminars in 1979.[18] Erdrich later published some of the poems and stories she wrote while in the M.A. program. She returned to Dartmouth as a writer-in-residence.[18]\\nAfter graduating from Dartmouth, Erdrich remained in contact with Michael Dorris. He attended one of her poetry readings, became impressed with her work, and developed an interest in working with her.[15] Although Erdrich and Dorris were on two different sides of the world, Erdrich in Boston and Dorris in New Zealand for field research, the two began to collaborate on short stories.\\nThe pair\\'s literary partnership led them to a romantic relationship. They married in 1981, and raised three children whom Dorris had adopted as a single parent (Reynold Abel, Madeline, and Sava[15]) and three biological children together (Persia, Pallas, and Aza Marion[20]). Reynold Abel suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome and in 1991, at age 23, he was killed when he was hit by a car.[21] In 1995, their son Sava accused Dorris of committing child abuse;[22] in 1997, after Dorris\\' death, his adopted daughter Madeline claimed that Dorris had sexually abused her and Erdrich had neglected to stop the abuse.[23]\\nDorris and Erdrich separated in 1995,[9] and would divorce in 1996.[11] Dorris, who was accused of sexually abusing two of the biological daughters he had with Erdrich,[10] died by suicide in 1997. In his will, he omitted Erdrich and his adopted children Sava and Madeline;[23] Madeline accused Dorris of sexually abusing her as well.[9]\\nIn 2001, at age 47, Erdrich gave birth to a daughter, Azure, fathered by a Native American man Erdrich declines to identify publicly.[24] She discusses her pregnancy with Azure, and Azure\\'s father, in her 2003 non-fiction book, Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country.[25] She uses the name \"Tobasonakwut\" to refer to him.[26][27] He is described as a traditional healer and teacher, who is eighteen years Erdrich\\'s senior and a married man.[26][25] In a number of publications, Tobasonakwut Kinew, who died in 2012, is referred to as Erdrich\\'s partner and the father of Azure.[28]\\nWhen asked in an interview if writing is a lonely life for her, Erdrich replied, \"Strangely, I think it is. I am surrounded by an abundance of family and friends and yet I am alone with the writing. And that is perfect.\" Erdrich lives in Minneapolis.[29]\\nIn 1979, she wrote \"The World\\'s Greatest Fisherman\",[30] a short story about June Kashpaw, a divorced Ojibwe woman whose death by hypothermia brought her relatives home to a fictional North Dakota reservation for her funeral. She wrote this while \"barricaded in the kitchen.\"[15] At her husband\\'s urging, she submitted it to the Nelson Algren Short Fiction competition in 1982, for which it won the $5,000 prize,[15] and eventually it became the first chapter of her debut novel, Love Medicine, published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston in 1984.[29]\\n\"When I found out about the prize I was living on a farm in New Hampshire near the college I\\'d attended,\" Erdrich told an interviewer. \"I was nearly broke and driving a car with bald tires. My mother knitted my sweaters, and all else I bought at thrift stores ... The recognition dazzled me. Later, I became friends with Studs Terkel and Kay Boyle, the judges, toward whom I carry a lifelong gratitude. This prize made an immense difference in my life.\"[31]\\nLove Medicine won the 1984 National Book Critics Circle Award.[32] It is the only debut novel ever to receive that honor.[33] Erdrich later turned Love Medicine into a tetralogy that includes The Beet Queen (1986), Tracks (1988), and The Bingo Palace (1994). It has also been featured on the National Advanced Placement Test for Literature.[34]\\nIn the early years of their marriage, Erdrich and Michael Dorris often collaborated on their work, saying they plotted the books together, \"talk about them before any writing is done, and then we share almost every day, whatever it is we\\'ve written\" but \"the person whose name is on the books is the one who\\'s done most of the primary writing.[19]\" They got started with \"domestic, romantic stuff\" published under the shared pen name of \"Milou North\" (Michael + Louise + where they live).[15]\\nDuring the publication of Love Medicine, Erdrich produced her first collection of poems, Jacklight (1984), which highlights the struggles between Native and non-Native cultures, as well as celebrating family, ties of kinship, autobiographical meditations, monologues, and love poetry. She incorporates elements of Ojibwe myths and legends.[18] Erdrich continues to write poems, which have been included in her collections.\\nErdrich is best known as a novelist, and has published a dozen award-winning and best-selling novels.[18] She followed Love Medicine with The Beet Queen (1986), which continued her technique of using multiple narrators[35] and expanded the fictional reservation universe of Love Medicine to include the nearby town of Argus, North Dakota. The action of the novel takes place mostly before World War II. Leslie Marmon Silko accused Erdrich\\'s The Beet Queen of being more concerned with postmodern technique than with the political struggles of Native peoples.[36]\\nTracks (1988) goes back to the early 20th century at the formation of the reservation. It introduces the trickster figure of Nanapush, who owes a clear debt to Ojibwe figure Nanabozho.[37] There are many studies of the trickster figure in Erdrich\\'s novels. Tracks shows early clashes between traditional ways and the Roman Catholic Church. The Bingo Palace (1994), set in the 1980s, describes the effects of a casino and a factory on the reservation community. Tales of Burning Love (1997) finishes the story of Sister Leopolda, a recurring character from all the previous books, and introduces a new set of European-American people into the reservation universe.\\nThe Antelope Wife (1998), Erdrich\\'s first novel after her divorce from Dorris, was the first of her novels to be set outside the continuity of the previous books.[3] Erdrich heavily revised the book in 2009 and published the revision as The Antelope Woman in 2016.[38]\\nShe subsequently returned to the reservation and nearby towns. She has published five novels since 1998 dealing with events in that fictional area. Among these are The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse (2001) and The Master Butchers Singing Club (2003). Both novels have geographic and character connections with The Beet Queen.  In 2009, Erdrich was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for The Plague of Doves[39] and a National Book Award finalist for The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse.[40] The Plague of Doves focuses on the historical lynching of four Native people wrongly accused of murdering a White family, and the effect of this injustice on the following generations. Her Pulitzer Prize–winning novel The Night Watchman[41] (2020) concerns a campaign to defeat the \\'termination bill\\' (introduced by Senator Arthur Vivian Watkins), and Erdrich acknowledged her sources and its inspiration being her maternal grandfather\\'s life.[42] Her most recent novel, The Sentence, tells the fictional story of a haunting at Erdrich\\'s Minneapolis bookstore, set against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, George Floyd\\'s murder, and the resulting protests.[43]\\nShe also writes for younger audiences; she has a children\\'s picture book Grandmother\\'s Pigeon, and her children\\'s book The Birchbark House, was a National Book Award finalist.[44]  She continued the series with The Game of Silence, winner of the Scott O\\'Dell Award for Historical Fiction,[45] The Porcupine Year, Chickadee, and Makoons.\\nIn addition to fiction and poetry, Erdrich has published nonfiction. The Blue Jay\\'s Dance (1995) is about her pregnancy and the birth of her third child.[46] Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country (2003) traces her travels in northern Minnesota and Ontario\\'s lakes following the birth of her youngest daughter.[47]\\nHer heritage from both parents is influential in her life and prominent in her work.[48] Although many of Erdrich\\'s works explore her Native American heritage, her novel The Master Butchers Singing Club (2003) featured the European, specifically German, side of her ancestry. The novel includes stories of a World War I veteran of the German Army and is set in a small North Dakota town.[49] The novel was a finalist for the National Book Award. \\nErdrich\\'s interwoven series of novels have drawn comparisons with William Faulkner\\'s Yoknapatawpha novels.  Like Faulkner\\'s, Erdrich\\'s successive novels created multiple narratives in the same fictional area and combined the tapestry of local history with current themes and modern consciousness.[50]\\nErdrich\\'s bookstore hosts literary readings and other events. Her new works are read here, and events celebrate the works and careers of other writers as well, particularly local Native writers. Erdrich and her staff consider Birchbark Books to be a \"teaching bookstore\".[51] In addition to books, the store sells Native art and traditional medicines, and Native American jewelry. Wiigwaas Press, a small nonprofit publisher founded by Erdrich and her sister, is affiliated with the store.[51]\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nEdna Ferber (August 15, 1885 – April 16, 1968) was an American novelist, short story writer and playwright. Her novels include the Pulitzer Prize-winning So Big (1924), Show Boat (1926; made into the celebrated 1927 musical), Cimarron (1930; adapted into the 1931 film which won the Academy Award for Best Picture), Giant (1952; made into the 1956 film of the same name) and Ice Palace (1958), which also received a film adaptation in 1960. She helped adapt her short story \"Old Man Minick\", published in 1922, into a play (Minick) and it was thrice adapted to film, in 1925 as the silent film Welcome Home, in 1932 as The Expert, and in 1939 as No Place to Go.\\nFerber was born August 15, 1885, in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to a Hungarian-born Jewish storekeeper, Jacob Charles Ferber, and his Milwaukee, Wisconsin-born wife, Julia (Neumann) Ferber, who was of German Jewish descent.  The Ferbers had moved to Kalamazoo from Chicago, Illinois in order to open a dry goods store, and her older sister Fannie was born there three years earlier.[1][2][3]\\nFerber\\'s father was not adept at business,[4] and the family moved often during Ferber\\'s childhood.\\nFrom Kalamazoo, they returned  to Chicago for a year, and then\\nmoved to Ottumwa, Iowa where they resided from 1890 to 1897 (ages 5 to 12 for Ferber). In Ottumwa, Ferber and her family faced brutal anti-Semitism, including adult males verbally abusing, mocking and spitting on her on days when she brought lunch to her father, often mocking her in a Yiddish accent.[5][6][7] \\nAccording to Ferber, her years in Ottumwa \"must be held accountable for anything in me that is hostile toward the world\".[8]\\nDuring this time, Ferber\\'s father began to lose his eyesight, necessitating costly and ultimately unsuccessful treatments.[9] At the age of 12, Ferber and her family moved to Appleton, Wisconsin, where she graduated from high school and later briefly attended Lawrence University.\\nAfter graduation, Ferber planned to study elocution, with vague thoughts of someday becoming an actor, but her family could not afford to send her to college.  \\nOn the spur of the moment, she took a job as a cub reporter at the Appleton Daily Crescent and subsequently moved to the Milwaukee Journal.[10][7] In early 1909 Ferber suffered a bout of anemia and returned to Appleton to recuperate.  She never resumed her career as a reporter, although she subsequently covered the 1920 Republican National Convention and 1920 Democratic National Convention for the United Press Association.[11][12]\\nWhile Ferber was recovering, she began writing and selling short stories to various magazines, and in 1911 she published her first novel, Dawn O\\'Hara, The Girl Who Laughed.  In 1912, a collection of her short stories was published in a volume entitled Buttered Side Down.  In her autobiography, Ferber wrote:[13]\\nIn that day, and for a girl in her early twenties, they were rather hard tough stories... The book got good reviews. I was startled and grimly pleased when some of the reviewers said that obviously these stories had been written by a man who had taken a feminine nom de plume as a hoax.  I have always thought that a writing style should be impossible of sex determination; I don\\'t think the reader should be able to say whether a book has been written by a man or a woman.In 1925, she won the Pulitzer Prize for her book So Big. Ferber initially believed her draft of what would become So Big lacked a plot, glorified failure, and had a subtle theme that could easily be overlooked. When she sent the book to her usual publisher, Doubleday, she was surprised to learn that he greatly enjoyed the novel. This was reflected by the several hundreds of thousands of copies of the novel sold to the public.[14]  Following the award, the novel was made into a silent film starring Colleen Moore that same year. A remake followed in 1932, starring Barbara Stanwyck and George Brent, with Bette Davis in a supporting role. A 1953 version of So Big starring Jane Wyman is the most popular version to modern audiences.[14]\\nRiding the popularity of So Big, Ferber\\'s next novel, Show Boat, was just as successful. Shortly after its release, composer Jerome Kern proposed turning it into a musical. Ferber was shocked, thinking it would be transformed into a typical light entertainment of the 1920s. It was not until Kern explained that he and Oscar Hammerstein II wanted to create a different type of musical that Ferber granted him the rights and it premiered on Broadway in 1927, and has been revived 8 times.\\nHer 1952 novel, Giant, became the basis of the 1956 movie, starring Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean and Rock Hudson.[14]\\nFerber was reportedly the first author to assign film rights to her books on short-term contracts so that the rights needed to be renegotiated regularly.[15]\\nFerber died at her home in New York City, of stomach cancer,[16] at the age of 82. She left her estate to her sister and nieces.[17]\\nFerber never married, had no children, and is not known to have engaged in a romance or sexual relationship.[a]\\nIn her early novel Dawn O\\'Hara, the title character\\'s aunt remarks, \"Being an old maid was a great deal like death by drowning – a really delightful sensation when you ceased struggling.\" Ferber did take a maternal interest in the career of her niece Janet Fox, an actress who performed in the original Broadway casts of Ferber\\'s plays Dinner at Eight (1932) and Stage Door (1936).\\nFerber was known for being outspoken and having a quick wit. On one occasion, she led other Jewish guests in leaving a house party after learning the host was antisemitic.[17] Once, after Noël Coward joked about how her suit made her resemble a man, she replied, \"So does yours.\"[6]\\n\\nStarting in 1922, Ferber began to visit Europe once or twice annually for thirteen or fourteen years.[18] During this time and unlike most Americans, she became troubled by the rise of the Nazi Party and its spreading of the antisemitic prejudice she had faced in her childhood. She commented on this saying, \"It was a fearful thing to see a continent – a civilization – crumbling before one\\'s eyes. It was a rapid and seemingly inevitable process to which no one paid any particular attention.\"[19] Her fears greatly influenced her work, which often featured themes of racial and cultural discrimination. Her 1938 autobiography, A Peculiar Treasure, originally included a spiteful dedication to Adolf Hitler which stated: To Adolf Hitler, who has made me a better Jew and a more understanding human being, as he has of millions of other Jews, this book is dedicated in loathing and contempt.[7]While this was changed by the time of the book\\'s publication, it still alluded to the Nazi threat.[18] She frequently mentions Jewish success in her book, alluding to and wanting to show not just that Jewish success, but Jews being able to use that and prevail.[18]\\nFerber was a member of the Algonquin Round Table, a group of wits who met for lunch every day at the Algonquin Hotel in New York. Ferber and another member of the Round Table, Alexander Woollcott, were long-time enemies, their antipathy lasting until Woollcott\\'s death in 1943, although Howard Teichmann states in his biography of Woollcott that their feud was due to a misunderstanding. According to Teichmann, Ferber once described Woollcott as \"a New Jersey Nero who has mistaken his pinafore for a toga\".\\nFerber collaborated with Round Table member George S. Kaufman on several plays presented on Broadway: Minick (1924), The Royal Family (1927), Dinner At Eight (1932), The Land Is Bright (1941), Stage Door (1936), and Bravo! (1948).[20]\\nIn a poll carried out by the Saturday Review of Literature, asking American writers which presidential candidate they supported in the 1940 election, Ferber endorsed Franklin D. Roosevelt.[21]\\nFerber\\'s novels generally featured strong female protagonists, along with a rich and diverse collection of supporting characters. She usually highlighted at least one strong secondary character who faced discrimination, ethnic or otherwise.[22]\\nFerber\\'s works often concerned small subsets of American culture, and sometimes took place in exotic locations she had visited but was not intimately familiar with, such as Texas or Alaska. She thus helped to highlight the diversity of American culture to those who did not have the opportunity to experience it. Some novels are set in places she had not visited.[23]\\nFerber wrote thirteen novels, two autobiographies, numerous short stories, and nine plays, many which were written in collaborations with other playwrights.[30]\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nJean Henri Gaston Giraud (French: [ʒiʁo]; 8 May 1938\\xa0– 10 March 2012) was a French artist, cartoonist and writer who worked in the Franco-Belgian bandes dessinées (BD) tradition. Giraud garnered worldwide acclaim predominantly under the pseudonym Mœbius (/ˈmoʊbiəs/;[1] French: [møbjys]) for his fantasy/science-fiction work, and to a slightly lesser extent as Gir (French: [ʒiʁ]), which he used for the Blueberry series and his other Western themed work. Esteemed by Federico Fellini, Stan Lee, and Hayao Miyazaki, among others,[2] he has been described as the most influential bande dessinée artist after Hergé.[3]\\nHis most famous body of work as Gir concerns the Blueberry series, created with writer Jean-Michel Charlier, featuring one of the first antiheroes in Western comics, and which is particularly valued in continental Europe. As Mœbius he achieved worldwide renown (in this case in the English-speaking nations and Japan as well – where his work as Gir had not done well), by creating a wide range of science-fiction and fantasy comics in a highly imaginative, surreal, almost abstract style. These works include Arzach and the Airtight Garage of Jerry Cornelius. He also collaborated with avant-garde filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky for an unproduced adaptation of Dune and the comic book series The Incal.\\nMœbius also contributed storyboards and concept designs to numerous science-fiction and fantasy films, such as Alien, Tron, The Fifth Element, and The Abyss. Blueberry was adapted for the screen in 2004 by French director Jan Kounen.\\nJean Giraud was born in Nogent-sur-Marne, Val-de-Marne, in the suburbs of Paris, on 8 May 1938,[4][5] as the only child to Raymond Giraud, an insurance agent, and Pauline Vinchon, who had worked at the agency.[6] When he was three years old, his parents divorced and he was subsequently raised by mainly his grandparents, who were living in the neighboring municipality of Fontenay-sous-Bois (much later, when he was an acclaimed artist, Giraud returned to live in the municipality in the mid-1970s, but was unable to buy his grandparents\\' erstwhile house[7]). The rupture between mother and father created a lasting trauma that he explained lay at the heart of his choice of separate pen names.[8] A somewhat sickly and introverted child at first, young Giraud found solace after World War II in a small theater, located on a corner in the street where his mother lived, which concurrently provided an escape from the dreary atmosphere in postwar reconstruction-era France.[9] Playing an abundance of American B-movie Westerns, Giraud, frequenting the theater there as often as he was able to, developed a passion for the genre, as did so many other European boys his age in those times.[7]\\nAt age 9–10, Giraud started to draw Western comics while enrolled by his single mother as a stop-gap measure in the Saint-Nicolas boarding school in Issy-les-Moulineaux for two years (and where he became acquainted with Belgian comic magazines such as Spirou and Tintin), much to the amusement of his schoolmates.[10] In 1954, at age 16,[11] he began his only technical training at the École Supérieure des Arts Appliqués Duperré, where he started producing Western comics, though these did not sit well with his conventional teachers.[12] At the college, he befriended other future comic artists Jean-Claude Mézières and Pat Mallet\\xa0[fr]. With Mézières in particular, in no small part due to their shared passion for science fiction, Westerns and the Far West, Giraud developed a close, lifelong friendship,[13] calling him \"life\\'s continuing adventure\" in later life.[14] In 1956, he left art school without graduating to visit his mother, who had married a Mexican in Mexico, and stayed there for nine months.\\nThe experience of the Mexican desert, in particular its endless blue skies and unending flat plains, now seeing and experiencing for himself the vistas that had enthralled him so much when watching Westerns on the silver screen only a few years earlier, left an everlasting, \"quelque chose qui m\\'a littéralement craqué l\\'âme\" (\"something which literally cracked open my soul\"),[15] enduring impression on him, easily recognizable in almost all of his later seminal works.[15] After his return to France, he started to work as a full-time tenured artist for Catholic publisher Fleurus presse\\xa0[fr],[16] to whom he was introduced by Mézières, who had shortly before found employment at the publisher.[17][10] In 1959–1960, he was slated for military service in, firstly the French occupation zone of Germany, and subsequently Algeria,[18] in the throes of the vicious Algerian War at the time. Fortunately for him, however, he somehow managed to escape frontline duty as he – being the only service man available at the time with a graphics background – served out his military obligations being set to work as illustrator on the army magazine 5/5 Forces Françaises, besides being assigned to logistic duties. Algeria was Giraud\\'s second acquaintance with other, more exotic cultures, and like he did in Mexico, he soaked in the experience, which made another indelible impression on the young man born as a suburban city boy, leaving its traces in his later comics, especially those created as \"Mœbius\".[7]\\nAt 18, Giraud was drawing his own humorous, Morris-inspired, Western comic two-page shorts, Frank et Jeremie, for the magazine Far West, his first freelance commercial sales.[19] Magazine editor Marijac thought young Giraud was gifted with a knack for humorous comics, but none whatsoever for realistically drawn comics, and advised him to continue in the vein of \"Frank et Jeremie\".[10]\\nTenured at publisher Fleurus from 1956 to 1958 after his first sales, Giraud did so, but concurrently continued to steadfastly create realistically drawn Western comics (alongside several others of a French historical nature) and illustrations for magazine editorials in their magazines Fripounet et Marisette, Cœurs Vaillants, and Âmes vaillantes\\xa0[fr] – all of them of a strong, edifying nature aimed at France\\'s adolescent youth – up to a point that his realistically drawn comics had become his mainstay. Among his realistic Westerns was a comic called \"Le roi des bisons\" (\"King of the Buffalo\" – has had an English publication[17]), and another called \"Un géant chez lez Hurons\" (\"A Giant among the Hurons\").[20] Actually, several of his Western comics, including \"King of the Buffalo\", featured the same protagonist Art Howell, and these can be considered as Giraud\\'s de facto first realistic Western series, as he himself did in effect, since he, save the first one, endowed these stories with the subtitle \"Un aventure d\\'Art Howell\".[21] For Fleurus, Giraud also illustrated his first three books.[22] Already in this period, his style was heavily influenced by his later mentor, Belgian comic artist Joseph \"Jijé\" Gillain, who at that time was the major source of inspiration for an entire generation of young, aspiring French comic artists, including Giraud\\'s friend Mézières, interested in doing realistically drawn comics.[17] How major Jijé\\'s influence was on these young artists, was amply demonstrated by the Fleurus publications these youngsters submitted their work to, as their work strongly resembled each other. For example, two of the books Giraud illustrated for Fleurus, were co-illustrated with Guy Mouminoux, another name of some future renown in the Franco-Belgian comic world, and Giraud\\'s work can only be identified, because he signed his work, whereas Mouminoux did not sign his. While not ample, Giraud\\'s earnings at Fleurus were just enough to allow him – disenchanted as he was with the courses, prevalent atmosphere, and academic discipline – to quit his art academy education after only two years, though he came to somewhat regret the decision in later life.[23]\\nShortly before he entered military service, Giraud visited his idol at his home for the first time with Mézières and Mallet, followed by a few visits on his own to see the master at work for himself. In 1961, returning from military service and his stint on 5/5 Forces Françaises, Giraud, not wanting to return to Fleurus, as he felt that he \"had to do something else, if he ever wanted to evolve\", became an apprentice of Jijé on his invitation, after he saw that Giraud had made artistic progress during his stay at 5/5 Forces Françaises.[24] Jijé was then one of the leading comic artists in Europe and known for his gracious tendency to voluntarily act as a mentor for young, aspiring comic artists, of whom Giraud was but one, going even as far as opening up his family home in Champrosay for days on end for these youngsters which, again, included Giraud.[25] In this, Jijé resembled Belgian comic grandmaster Hergé, but unlike Jijé, Hergé only did so on a purely self-serving commercial basis, never on a voluntarily one. For Jijé, Giraud created several other shorts and illustrations for the short-lived magazine Bonux-Boy (1960/61), his first comic work after military service, and his penultimate one before embarking on Blueberry.[26] In this period, Jijé used his apprentice for the inks on an outing of his Western series Jerry Spring – after whom Giraud had, unsurprisingly, modeled his Art Howell character previously – \"The Road to Coronado\", which Giraud inked.[18] Actually, Jijé had intended his promising pupil for the entirety of the story art, but the still-inexperienced Giraud, who was used to working under the relaxed conditions at Fleurus, found himself overwhelmed by the strict time schedules that production for a periodical (Spirou in this case) demanded. Conceding that he had been a bit too cocky and ambitious, Giraud stated, \"I started the story all by myself, but after a week, I had only finished half a plate, and aside from being soaked with my sweat, it was a complete disaster. So Joseph went on to do the penciling, whereas I did the inks.\"[10] Even though Giraud did lose touch with his mentor eventually, he never forgot what \"his master\" had provided him with, both \"aesthetically and professionally\",[27] the fatherless Giraud gratefully stating in later life, \"It was as if he had asked me «Do you want me to be your father?», and if by a miracle, I was provided with one, a[n] [comic] artist no less!\".[25]\\nAfter his stint at Jijé\\'s, Giraud was again approached by friend Mézières to see if he was interested to work alongside him as an illustrator on Hachette\\'s ambitious multivolume L\\'histoire des civilisations history reference work.[28] Spurred on by Jijé, who considered the opportunity a wonderful one for his pupil, Giraud accepted. Though he considered the assignment a daunting one, having to create in oil paints from historical objects and imagery, it was, besides being the best-paying job he had ever had, a seminal appointment.[25] At Hachette, Giraud discovered that he had a knack for creating art in gouaches, something that served him well not that much later when creating Blueberry magazine/album cover art,[29] as well as for his 1968 side project \"Buffalo Bill: le roi des éclaireurs\" history book written by George Fronval\\xa0[fr], for whom Giraud provided two-thirds of the illustrations in gouache, including the cover.[30] The assignment at Hachette being cut short because of his invitation to embark on Fort Navajo, meant he only participated on the first three to four volumes of the book series, leaving the completion to Mézières. In the Pilote era, Giraud additionally provided art in gouache for two Western-themed vinyl record music productions as sleeve art,[31] as well as the covers for the first seven outings in the French-language edition of the Morgan Kane Western novel series written by Louis Masterson.[32] Much of his Western-themed gouache artwork of this era, including that of Blueberry, has been collected in the 1983 artbook \"Le tireur solitaire\".[33]\\nAside from its professional importance, Giraud\\'s stint at Hachette was also of personal importance, as he met Claudine Conin, an editorial researcher at Hachette, and who described her future husband as being at the time \"funny, uncomplicated, friendly, a nice boy next-door\", but on the other hand, \"mysterious, dark, intellectual\", already recognizing that he had all the makings of a \"visionary\", long before others did.[34] Married in 1967, after Giraud had become the recognized Blueberry artist, the couple had two children, Hélène (b:1970) and Julien (b:1972). Daughter Hélène in particular has inherited her father\\'s graphics talents and has carved out a career as a graphics artist in the animation industry,[35] earning her a 2014 French civilian knighthood, the same her father had already received in 1985. Besides raising their children, wife Claudine not only took care of the business aspects of her husband\\'s art work, but has on occasion also contributed to it as colorist.[36] The 1976 feminist fantasy short story, \"La tarte aux pommes\",[37] was written by her under her maiden name. Additionally, the appearance of a later, major character in Giraud\\'s Blueberry series, Chihuahua Pearl, was in part based on Claudine\\'s looks.[38] The Mœbiusienne 1973 fantasy road trip short story \"La déviation\",[39] created as \"Gir\"[40] before the artist fully embarked on his Mœbius career, featured the Giraud family as the protagonists, save Julien.\\nIn October 1963, Giraud and writer Jean-Michel Charlier started the comic strip Fort Navajo for the Charlier-co-founded Pilote magazine, issue 210.[41] At this time the affinity between the styles of Giraud and Jijé (who in effect had been Charlier\\'s first choice for the series, but who was reverted to Giraud by Jijé) was so close that Jijé penciled several pages for the series when Giraud went AWOL. In effect, when \"Fort Navajo\" started its run, Pilote received angry letters, accusing Giraud of plagiarism, which was however foreseen by Jijé and Giraud. Shirking off the accusations, Jijé encouraged his former pupil to stay the course instead, thereby propping up his self-confidence.[25] The first time Jijé had to fill in for Giraud, was during the production of the second story, \"Thunder in the West\" (1964), when the still inexperienced Giraud, buckling under the stress of having to produce a strictly scheduled magazine serial, suffered from a nervous breakdown, with Jijé taking on plates 28–36.[42] The second time occurred one year later, during the production of \"Mission to Mexico (The Lost Rider)\", when Giraud unexpectedly packed up and left to travel the United States,[43] and, again, Mexico; yet again former mentor Jijé came to the rescue by penciling plates 17–38.[44][45] While the art style of both artists had been nearly indistinguishable from each other in \"Thunder in the West\", after Giraud resumed work on plate 39 of \"Mission to Mexico\", a clearly noticeable style breach was now observable, indicating that Giraud was now well on his way to develop his own signature style, eventually surpassing that of his former teacher Jijé, who, impressed by his former pupil\\'s achievements, has later coined him the \"Rimbaud de la BD\".[25]\\nThe Lieutenant Blueberry character, whose facial features were based on those of the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, was created in 1963 by Charlier (scenario) and Giraud (drawings) for Pilote.[46][47] While the Fort Navajo series had originally been intended as an ensemble narrative, it quickly gravitated towards having Blueberry as its central figure. His featured adventures, in what was later called the Blueberry series, may be Giraud\\'s best known work in native France and the rest of Europe, before later collaborations with Alejandro Jodorowsky. The early Blueberry comics used a simple line drawing style similar to that of Jijé, and standard Western themes and imagery (specifically, those of John Ford\\'s US Cavalry Western trilogy, with Howard Hawk\\'s 1959 Rio Bravo thrown in for good measure for the sixth, one-shot title \"The Man with the Silver Star\"), but gradually Giraud developed a darker and grittier style inspired by, firstly the 1970 Westerns Soldier Blue and Little Big Man (for the \"Iron Horse\" story-arc), and subsequently by the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone and the dark realism of Sam Peckinpah in particular (for the \"Lost Goldmine\" story-arc and beyond).[48] With the fifth album, \"The Trail of the Navajos\", Giraud established his own style, and after both editorial control and censorship laws were loosened in the wake of the May 1968 social upheaval in France – the former in no small part due to the revolt key comic artists, Giraud chief among them, staged a short time thereafter in the editorial offices of Dargaud, the publisher of Pilote, demanding and ultimately receiving more creative freedom from editor-in-chief René Goscinny[a] – the strip became more explicitly adult, and also adopted a thematically wider range.[3][45] The first Blueberry album penciled by Giraud after he had begun publishing science fiction as Mœbius, \"Nez Cassé\" (\"Broken Nose\"), was much more experimental than his previous Western work.[45] While the editorial revolt at Dargaud had effectively become the starting point of the emancipation of the French comic world,[50] Giraud admitted that it also had caused a severe breach in his hitherto warm relationship with the conservative Goscinny, which never fully mended.[51]\\nGiraud left the series and publisher in 1974, partly because he was tired of the publication pressure he was under in order to produce the series, partly because of an emerging royalties conflict, but mostly because he wanted further explore and develop his \"Mœbius\" alter ego, in particular because Jodorowsky, who was impressed by the graphic qualities of Blueberry, had already invited him to Los Angeles to start production design on his Dune movie project, and which constituted the first Jodorowsky/Mœbius collaboration. Giraud was so eager to return to the project during a stopover from the United States while the project was in hiatus, that he greatly accelerated the work on the \"Angel Face\" outing of Blueberry he was working on at the time, shearing off weeks from its originally intended completion.[52] The project fell through though, and after he had returned definitely to France later that year, he started to produce comic work under this pseudonym that was published in the magazine he co-founded, Métal Hurlant, which started its run in December 1974 and revolutionized the Franco-Belgian comic world in the process.\\nIt was Jodorowsky who introduced Giraud to the writings of Carlos Castaneda, who had written a series of books that describe his training in shamanism, particularly with a group whose lineage descended from the Toltecs. The books, narrated in the first person, related his experiences under the tutelage of a Yaqui \"Man of Knowledge\" named Don Juan Matus. Castaneda\\'s writings made a deep and everlasting impression on Giraud, already open to Native-Mexican folk culture due to his three previous extended trips to the country (he had visited the country a third time in 1972[53]), and it did influence his art as \"Mœbius\", particularly in regard to dream sequences, though he was not quite able to work in such influences in his mainstream Blueberry comic.[b][55] Yet, unbeknownst to writer Charlier, he did already sneak in some Castaneda elements in \"Nez Cassé\".[56] Castaneda\\'s influence reasserted itself in full in Giraud\\'s later life, having worked in elements more openly after Charlier\\'s death in his 1999 Blueberry outing \"Geronimo l\\'Apache\", and was to become a major element for his Blueberry 1900-project, which however, had refused to come to fruition for extraneous reasons.[57][58]\\nEven though Giraud had vainly tried to introduce his Blueberry co-worker to the writings of Castaneda, Charlier, being of a previous generation, conservative in nature and wary of science fiction in general, never understood what his younger colleague tried to achieve as \"Mœbius\". Nonetheless, he never tried to hinder Giraud in the least, as he understood that an artist of Giraud\\'s caliber needed a \"mental shower\" from time to time. Furthermore, Charlier was very appreciative of the graphic innovations Giraud ported over from his work as \"Mœbius\" into the mainstream Blueberry series, most specifically \"Nez Cassé\", making him \"one of the all-time greatest artists in the comic medium,\" as Charlier himself put it in 1982.[59] Artist Michel Rouge\\xa0[fr], who was taken on by Giraud in 1980 for the inks of \"La longue marche\" (\"The Long March\") painted a slightly different picture though. Already recognizing that the two men were living in different worlds, he noted that Charlier was not pleased with Giraud taking on an assistant, afraid that it might have been a prelude to his leaving the series in order to pursue his \"experimentations\" as Mœbius further. While Charlier was willing to overlook Giraud\\'s \"philandering\" in his case only, he was otherwise of the firm conviction that artists, especially his own, should totally and wholeheartedly devote themselves to their craft, as Charlier had always considered the medium.[60] Even Giraud was in later life led to believe that Charlier apparently \"detested\" his other work, looking upon it as something akin to \"treason\", though his personal experiences with the author was that he had kept an \"open mind\" in this regard, at least in his case. According to Giraud, Charlier\\'s purported stance negatively influenced his son Philippe, causing their relationship to rapidly deteriorate into open animosity, after the death of his father.[57][61]\\nGiraud returned to the Blueberry series in 1979 with \"Nez Cassé\" as a free-lancer. Later that year however, the long-running disagreement Charlier and Giraud had with their publishing house Dargaud, the publisher of Pilote, over the residuals from Blueberry came to a head. They began the Western comic Jim Cutlass as a means to put the pressure on Dargaud.[57] It did not work, and Charlier and Giraud turned their back on the parent publisher definitively,[49] leaving for greener pastures elsewhere, and in the process taking all of Charlier\\'s other co-creations with them. It would be nearly fifteen years before the Blueberry series (and the others) returned to Dargaud after Charlier died. (For further particulars, including the royalties conflict, see: Blueberry publication history.) After the first album, \"Mississippi River\", first serialized in Métal Hurlant and for two decades remaining a one-shot, Giraud took on scripting the revitalized series after Charlier had died, while leaving the artwork to Christian Rossi\\xa0[fr].[62]\\nWhen Charlier, Giraud\\'s collaborator on Blueberry, died in 1989, Giraud assumed responsibility for the scripting of the main series, the last outing of which, \"Apaches\", released in 2007, became the last title Giraud created for the parent publisher. Blueberry has been translated into 19 languages, the first English book translations being published in 1977/78 by UK publisher Egmont/Methuen, though its publication was cut short after only four volumes. The original Blueberry series has spun off a prequel series called Young Blueberry in the Pilote-era (1968–1970), but the artwork was in 1984, when that series was resurrected, left to Colin Wilson and later Michel Blanc-Dumont\\xa0[fr] after the first three original volumes in that series, as well as the Giraud-written, but William Vance-penciled, 1991-2000 intermezzo series called Marshal Blueberry.[46] All these series, except Jim Cutlass, had returned to the parent publisher Dargaud in late 1993, though Giraud himself – having already left the employ of the publisher in 1974 (see below) – had not, instead plying his trade as a free-lancer, explaining the Jim Cutlass exception.\\nWhile Giraud has garnered universal praise and acclaim for his work as \"Mœbius\" (especially in the US, the UK and Japan), as \"Gir\", Blueberry has always remained his most successful and most recognized work in native France itself and in mainland Europe, despite its artist developing somewhat of a love/hate relationship with his co-creation in later life, which was exemplified by his regularly taking extended leaves of absence from it. That Blueberry has always remained his primary source of income, allowing him to fully indulge in his artistic endeavors as Mœbius, was admitted as such by Giraud as early as 1979: \"If an album of Moebius is released, about 10,000 people are interested. A Blueberry album sells at least 100,000 copies [in France],\"[63][56] and as late as 2005, \"Blueberry is in some ways the \\'sponsor\\' of Moebius, for years now.\"[64]\\nThe \"Mœbius\" pseudonym, which Giraud came to use for his science fiction and fantasy work, was born in 1963,[18] while he was working on the Hachette project, as he did not like \"to work on paintings alone all day\", and \"like an alcoholic needing his alcohol\" had to create comics.[65] In a satire magazine called Hara-Kiri, Giraud used the name for 21 strips in 1963–64 (much of which collected in Epic\\'s \"Mœbius 1⁄2\" – see below). Though Giraud enjoyed the artistic freedom and atmosphere at the magazine greatly, he eventually gave up his work there as Blueberry, on which he had embarked in the meantime, demanded too much of his energy, aside from being a better paid job. Magazine editor-in-chief Cavanna was loath to let Giraud go, not understanding why Giraud would want to waste his talents on a \"kiddy comic\".[65] Subsequently, the pseudonym went unused for a decade, that is for comics at least, as Giraud continued its use for side-projects as illustrator. In the late 1960s-early 1970s, Giraud provided interior front, and back flyleaf illustrations as Mœbius for several outings in the science fiction book club series Club du livre d\\'anticipation\\xa0[fr], a limited edition hardcover series, collecting work from seminal science fiction writers, from French publisher Éditions OPTA\\xa0[fr], continuing to do so throughout the 1970s with several additional covers for the publisher\\'s Fiction (the magazine that introduced Giraud to science fiction at age 16)[66] and Galaxie-bis\\xa0[fr] science fiction magazine and pocket book series. Additionally, this period in time also saw four vinyl record music productions endowed with Mœbius sleeve art.[31] Much of this illustration art has been reproduced in Giraud\\'s first art book as Mœbius, aptly entitled \"Mœbius\", released in 1980.[40][67] There actually had also been a personal reason as well for Giraud to suspend his career as Mœbius comic artist; after he had returned from his second trip from Mexico, he found himself confronted with the artist\\'s version of a writer\\'s block as far as Mœbius comics were concerned, partly because Blueberry consumed all his energy. \"For eight months I tried, but I could not do it, so I quit\", stated Giraud additionally.[65] Giraud\\'s statement notwithstanding though, he did a couple of Hara-Kiriesque satirical comic shorts for Pilote in the early 1970s, but under the pseudonym \"Gir\", most of which reprinted in the comic book Gir œuvres: \"Tome 1, Le lac des émeraudes\",[68] also collecting shorts he had created for the Fleurus magazines, Bonux-Boy, and the late-1960s TOTAL Journal magazine.[26]\\nIn 1974 he truly revived the Mœbius pseudonym for comics, and the very first, 12-page, story he created as such – while on one of his stopovers from America when the Dune production was in a lull – was \"Cauchemar Blanc\" (\"White Nightmare\"), published in the magazine L\\'Écho des savanes, issue 8, 1974. The black & white story dealt with the racist murder of an immigrant of North-African descent, and stands out as one of the very few emphatic socially engaged works of Giraud.[69] Bearing in mind Giraud\\'s fascination with the Western genre in general and the cultural aspects of Native Americans in particular – and whose plight Giraud had always been sympathetic to[c] – it is hardly a surprise that two later examples of such rare works were Native-American themed.[d] These concerned the 2-page short story \"Wounded Knee\",[71] inspired by the eponymous 1973 incident staged by Oglala Lakota, and the 3-page short story \"Discours du Chef Seattle\", first published in the artbook \"Made in L.A.\"[72] (\"The Words of Chief Seattle\", in Epic\\'s \"Ballad for a Coffin\"). Giraud suddenly bursting out onto the comic scene as \"Mœbius\", caught European readership by surprise, and it took many of them, especially outside France, a couple of years before the realization had sunk in that \"Jean Gir[raud]\" and \"Mœbius\" were, physically at least, one and the same artist.[69]\\nIt was when he was brainstorming with the founding editors of the magazine (founded by former Pilote friends and co-artists in the wake of the revolt at the publisher, when they decided to strike out on their own), that Giraud came up with his first major Mœbius work, \"Le bandard fou\" (\"The Horny Goof\"). Released directly as album (a first for Mœbius comics) in black & white by the magazine\\'s publisher,[73] the humorous and satirical story dealt with a law-abiding citizen of the planet Souldaï, who awakens one day, only to find himself with a permanent erection. Pursued through space and time by his own puritanical authorities, who frown upon the condition, and other parties, who have their own intentions with the hapless bandard, he eventually finds a safe haven on the asteroid Fleur of Madame Kowalsky, after several hilarious adventures. When discounting the as \"Gir\" signed \"La déviation\", it is in this story that Giraud\\'s signature, minute \"Mœbius\" art style, for which he became famed not that much later, truly comes into its own. Another novelty introduced in the book, is that the narrative is only related on the right-hand pages; the left-hand pages are taken up by one-page panels depicting an entirely unrelated cinematographic sequence of a man transforming after he has snapped his fingers. The story did raise some eyebrows with critics accusing Giraud of pornography at the time, but one reviewer put it in perspective when stating, \"Peut-être Porno, mais Graphique!\", which loosely translates as \"Porn maybe, but Graphic Art for sure!\".[74] In the editorial of the 1990 American edition, Giraud has conceded that he was envious of what his former Pilote colleagues had achieved with L\\'Écho des savanes in regard to creating a free, creative environment for their artists, he had already enjoyed so much back at Hara-Kiri, and that it was an inspiration for the endeavor, Giraud embarked upon next.\\nLater that year, after Dune was permanently canceled with him definitively returning to France, Giraud became one of the founding members of the comics art group and publishing house \"Les Humanoïdes Associés\", together with fellow comic artists Jean-Pierre Dionnet, Philippe Druillet (likewise Pilote colleagues) and (outsider) financial director Bernard Farkas. In imitation of the example set by the L\\'Écho des savanes founding editors, it was therefore as such also an indirect result of the revolt these artists had previously staged at Pilote, and whose employ they had left for the undertaking.[75] Together they started the monthly magazine Métal hurlant (\"Screaming metal\") in December 1974,[76] and for which he had temporarily abandoned his Blueberry series. The translated version was known in the English-speaking world as Heavy Metal, and started its release in April 1977, actually introducing Giraud\\'s work to North-American readership.[77] Mœbius\\' famous serial \"The Airtight Garage\" and his groundbreaking \"Arzach\" both began in Métal hurlant.[78] Unlike Hara-Kiri and L\\'Écho des savanes though, whose appeal has always remained somewhat limited to the socially engaged satire and underground comic scenes, it was Métal hurlant in particular that revolutionized the world of Franco-Belgian bandes dessinées,[50] whereas its American cousin left an indelible impression on a generation of not only American comic artists, but on film makers as well, as evidenced below.\\nStarting its publication in the first issue of Métal hurlant, \"Arzach\" is a wordless 1974–1975 comic, executed directly in color and created as a conscious attempt to breathe new life into the comic genre which at the time was dominated by American superhero comics in the United States, and by the traditional, adolescent oriented bandes dessinée in Europe.[79] It tracks the journey of the title character flying on the back of his pterodactyl through a fantastic world mixing medieval fantasy with futurism. Unlike most science fiction comics, it is, save for the artfully executed story titles, entirely devoid of captions, speech balloons and written sound effects. It has been argued that the wordlessness provides the strip with a sense of timelessness, setting up Arzach\\'s journey as a quest for eternal, universal truths.[2] The short stories \"L\\'Homme est-il bon?\" (\"Is Man Good?\", in issue 10, 1976, after the first publication in Pilote, issue 744, 1974, which however woke Giraud up to the \"unbearable realization\" that he was \"enriching\" the publisher with his Mœbius work, thereby expediting his departure.[80]), \"Ballade\" (\"The Ballade\", 1977 and inspired by the poem \"Fleur\" by French poet Arthur Rimbaud[81]), \"Ktulu\" (issue 33bis, 1978, an H. P. Lovecraft-inspired story) and \"Citadelle aveugle\" (\"The White Castle\", in issue 51, 1980 and oddly enough signed as \"Gir\") were examples of additional stories Giraud created directly in color, shortly after \"Arzach\". 1976 saw the Métal hurlant, issues 7–8, publication of \"The Long Tomorrow\", written by Dan O\\'Bannon in 1974 during lulls in the pre-production of Jodorowsky\\'s Dune.[82]\\nHis series The Airtight Garage, starting its magazine run in issue 6, 1976, is particularly notable for its non-linear plot, where movement and temporality can be traced in multiple directions depending on the readers\\' own interpretation even within a single planche (page or picture). The series tells of Major Grubert, who is constructing his own multi-level universe on an asteroid named Fleur (from the \"Bandard fou\" universe incidentally, and the first known instance of the artist\\'s attempts of tying all his \"Mœbius\" creations into one coherent Airtight Garage universe), where he encounters a wealth of fantastic characters including Michael Moorcock\\'s creation Jerry Cornelius.[83]\\n1978 marked the publication of the 54-page \"Les yeux du chat\" (\"Eyes of the Cat\"). The dark, disturbing and surreal tale dealt with a blind boy in a non-descript empty cityscape, who has his pet eagle scout for eyes, which it finds by taking these from a street cat and offering them to his awaiting companion who, while grateful, expresses his preference for the eyes of a child. The story premise originated from a brainstorming session Alejandro Jodorowsky had with his fellows of the Académie Panique, a group concentrated on chaotic and surreal performance art, as a response to surrealism becoming mainstream.[84] Jodorowsky worked out the story premise as a therapy to alleviate the depression he was in after the failure of his Dune project and presented the script to Giraud in 1977 during a visit to Paris. Deeming the story too short for a regular, traditional comic, it was Giraud who suggested the story to be told on the format he had already introduced in \"Le bandard fou\", to wit, as single panel pages. On recommendation of Jodorowsky, he refined the format by relating the eagle\\'s quest on the right-hand pages, while depicting the awaiting boy in smaller single panel left-hand pages from a contra point-of-view. Giraud furthermore greatly increased his already high level of detail by making extensive use of zipatone for the first time.[85] Considered a key and seminal work, both for its art and storytelling, setting Jodorowsky off on his career as comic writer,[86] the art evoked memories of the wood engravings from the 19th century, including those of Gustave Doré, that Giraud discovered and admired in the books of his grandparents when he was living there in his childhood. However, it—like \"La déviation\"—has remained somewhat of a one-shot in Giraud\\'s body of work in its utilization of such a high level of detail.[87] The story, printed on yellow paper to accentuate the black & white art, was originally published directly as a, to 5000 copies limited book edition, gift item for relations of the publisher.[88] It was only after expensive pirate editions started to appear that the publisher decided to make the work available commercially on a wider scale, starting in 1981.[89][90] Jodorowsky had intended the work to be the first of a trilogy, but that never came to fruition.[91]\\nIn a certain way \"Les yeux du chat\" concluded a phase that had started with \"La Déviation\",[86] and this viewpoint was adhered to by the publisher who had coined the era \"Les années Métal Hurlant\" on one of its latter-day anthologies.[92] The very first \"Mœbius\" anthology collection the publisher released as such, was the 1980–1985 Moebius œuvres complètes six-volume collection of which two, volumes 4, \"La Complainte de l\\'Homme Programme\"[93] and 5, \"Le Désintégré Réintégré\"[94] (the two of them in essence comprising an expanded version of the 1980 original[67]), were Mœbius art books.[95] It also concluded a phase in which Giraud was preoccupied in a \"characteristic period in his life\" in which he was \"very somber and pessimistic about my life\", resulting in several of his \"Mœbius\" stories of that period ending in death and destruction.[96] These included the poetic \"Ballade\", in which Giraud killed off the two protagonists, something he came to regret a decade later in this particular case.[81]\\nIn the magazine\\'s issue 58 of 1980 Giraud started his famous L\\'Incal series in his third collaboration with Jodorowsky.[97] However, by this time Giraud felt that his break-out success as \"Mœbius\" had come at a cost. He had left Pilote to escape the pressure and stifling conditions he was forced to work under, seeking complete creative freedom, but now it was increasingly becoming \"as stifling as it had been before with Blueberry\", as he conceded in 1982, adding philosophically, \"The more you free yourself, the more powerless you become!\".[98] How deeply ingrained this sentiment was, was evidenced in a short interview in Métal Hurlant, issue 82, later that year, where an overworked Giraud stated, \"I will finish the Blueberry series, I will finish the John Difool [Incal] series and then I\\'m done. Then I will quit comics!\" At the time he had just finished working as storyboard, and production design artist on the Movie Tron, something he had enjoyed immensely. Fortunately for his fans, Giraud did not act upon his impulse as history has shown, though he did take action to escape the hectic Parisian comic scene in 1980 by moving himself and his family as far away from Paris as possible in France, and relocated to the small city of Pau at the foothills of the Pyrenees.[56] It was while he was residing in Pau that Giraud started to take an interest in the teachings of Jean-Paul Appel-Guéry, becoming an active member of his group and partaking in their gatherings.[99]\\nFrom 1985 to 2001 he also created his six-volume fantasy series Le Monde d\\'Edena, which has appeared in English as The Aedena Cycle.[100] The stories were strongly influenced by the teachings of Jean-Paul Appel-Guéry,[e] and Guy-Claude Burger\\'s instinctotherapy. In effect, Giraud and his family did join Appel-Guéry\\'s commune on Tahiti in 1983, until late 1984, when the family moved to the United States, where Giraud set up shop first in Santa Monica, and subsequently in Venice and Woodland Hills, California.[102] Giraud\\'s one-shot comic book \"La nuit de l\\'étoile\"[103] was co-written by Appel-Guéry, and has been the most visible manifestation of Giraud\\'s stay on Tahiti, aside from the artbooks \"La memoire du futur\"[104] and \"Venise celeste\".[105] Concurrently collaborating on \"La nuit de l\\'étoile\" was young artist Marc Bati, also residing at the commune at the time, and for whom Giraud afterwards wrote the comic series Altor (The Magic Crystal), while in the US.[106] It was under the influence of Appel-Guéry\\'s teachings that Giraud conceived a third pseudonym, Jean Gir – formally introduced to the public as \"Jean Gir, Le Nouveau Mœbius\" in \"Venise celeste\" (p.\\xa033), though Giraud had by the time of publication already dispensed with the pseudonym himself – which appeared on the art he created while on Tahiti, though not using it for his Aedena Cycle. Another member of the commune was Paula Salomon, for whom Giraud had already illustrated her 1980 book \"La parapsychologie et vous\".[107] Having to move stateside for work served Giraud well, as he became increasingly disenchanted at a later stage with the way Appel-Guéry ran his commune on Tahiti, in the process dispensing with his short-lived third pseudonym.[15] His stay at the commune though, had practical implications on his personal life; Giraud gave up eating meat, smoking, coffee, alcohol and, for the time being, the use of mind-expanding substances, adhering to his newfound abstinence for the most part for the remainder of his life.[108]\\nDuring his stay on Tahiti, Giraud had co-founded his second publishing house under two concurrent imprints, Éditions Gentiane[109] (predominantly for his work as Gir, most notably Blueberry) and Aedena\\xa0[fr][110] (predominantly for his work as Mœbius, and not entirely by coincidence named after the series he was working on at the time), together with friend and former editor at Les Humanoïdes Associés, Jean Annestay\\xa0[fr], for the express purpose to release his work in a more artful manner, such as limited edition art prints, art books (\"La memoire du futur\" was first released under the Gentiane imprint, and reprinted under that of Aedena) and art portfolios. Both men had already released the very first such art book in the Humanoïdes days,[67] and the format then conceived – to wit, a large 30x30cm book format at first, with art organized around themes, introduced by philosophical poetry by Mœbius – was adhered to for later such releases, including \"La memoire du futur\".\\nThere were thousands of professionals who knew my work. That has always amazed me every time I entered some graphics, or animation studio, at Marvel or even at George Lucas\\'. Mentioning the name Jean Giraud did not cause any of the present pencillers, colorists or storyboard artists to even bat an eye. Yet, whenever I introduced myself as \"Mœbius\", all of them jumped up to shake my hand. It was incredible!After having arrived in California, Giraud\\'s wife Claudine set up Giraud\\'s third publishing house Starwatcher Graphics in 1985,[112] essentially the US branch of Gentiane/Aedena with the same goals, resulting in the release of, among others, the extremely limited art portfolio La Cité de Feu, a collaborative art project of Giraud with Geoff Darrow (see below). However, due to their unfamiliarity with the American publishing world, the company did not do well, and in an effort to remedy the situation Claudine hired the French/American editor couple Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier, whom she had met at the summer 1985 San Diego ComicCon,[113] as translators and editors-in-chief for Starwatcher, also becoming shareholders in the company.[111] Already veterans of the US publishing world (and Mœbius fans), it was the Lofficier couple that managed to convince editor-in-chief Archie Goodwin of Marvel Comics to publish most of Moebius\\' hitherto produced work on a wider scale in the US—in contrast with the Heavy Metal niche market releases by HM Communications in the late 1970s—in graphic novel format trade editions, under its Epic imprint from 1987 to 1994. These incidentally, included three of Mœbius\\' latter-day art books, as well as the majority of his Blueberry Western comic.[114]\\nIt was for the Marvel/Epic publication effort that it was decided to dispense with the \"Jean [Gir]aud\"/\"Mœbius\" dichotomy—until then strictly adhered-to by the artist—as both the artist\\'s given name and his Blueberry creation were all but unknown in the English speaking world. This was contrary to his reputation as \"Mœbius\", already acquired in the Heavy Metal days, and from then on used for all his work in the English speaking world (and Japan), though the dichotomy remained elsewhere, including native France.[115]\\nA two-issue Silver Surfer miniseries (later collected as Silver Surfer: Parable), written by Stan Lee and drawn by Giraud (as Mœbius), was published through Marvel\\'s Epic Comics imprint in 1988 and 1989. According to Giraud, this was his first time working under the Marvel method instead of from a full script, and he has admitted to being baffled by the fact that he already had a complete story synopsis on his desk only two days after he had met Stan Lee for the first time, having discussed what Giraud had assumed was a mere proposition over lunch.[76] This miniseries won the Eisner Award for best finite/limited series in 1989. Mœbius\\' version was discussed in the 1995 submarine thriller Crimson Tide by two sailors pitting his version against those of Jack Kirby, with the main character played by Denzel Washington, emphasizing the Kirby one being the better of the two. Becoming aware of the reference around 1997, Giraud was later told around 2005 by the movie\\'s director Tony Scott, that it was he who had written in the dialog as an homage to the artist on behalf of his brother Ridley, a Mœbius admirer, and not (uncredited) script doctor Quentin Tarentino (known for infusing his works with pop culture references) as he was previously led to believe.[116] An amused Giraud quipped, \"It\\'s better than a big stature, because in a way, I can not dream of anything better to be immortal [than] being in a movie about submarines!\"[1]\\nAs a result, from his cooperation with Marvel, Giraud delved deeper into the American superhero mythology and created superhero art stemming from both Marvel and DC Comics, which were sold as art prints, posters or included in calendars, besides becoming featured as comic book covers from both publishers.[117] Even as late as 1997, Giraud had created cover art for two DC comic book outings, Hardware (Vol. 1, issue 49, March 1997) and Static (Vol. 1, issue 45, March 1997), after an earlier cover for Marvel Tales (Vol. 2, issue 253, September 1991). Another project Giraud embarked upon in his \"American period\", was for a venture into that other staple of American pop culture, trading cards. Trading card company Comic Images released a \"Mœbius Collector Cards\" set in 1993, featuring characters and imagery from all over his Mœbius universe, though his Western work was excluded. None of the images were lifted from already existing work, but were especially created by Giraud the year previously.\\nAlthough Giraud had taken up residence in California for five years – holding a temporary residence (the O-1 \"Extraordinary Ability\" category,[118] including the \"International Artist\" status[119]) visa – he maintained a transient lifestyle, as his work had him frequently travel to Belgium and native France (maintaining a home in Paris), as well as to Japan, for extended periods of time. His stay in the United States was an inspiration for his aptly called Made in L.A. art book,[72] and much of his art he had produced in this period of time, including his super hero art, was reproduced in this, and the follow-up art book Fusions,[120] the latter of which having seen a translation in English by Epic.\\nGiraud\\'s extended stay in the US, garnered him a 1986 Inkpot Award, an additional 1991 Eisner Award, as well as three Harvey Awards in the period 1988–1991 for the various graphic novel releases by Marvel. It was in this period that Giraud, who had already picked up Spanish as a second language as a result from his various trips to Mexico and his dealings with Jodorowsky and his retinue, also picked up sufficient language skills to communicate in English.[121][1]\\nIn late summer 1989, Giraud returned to France, definitively as it turned out, though that was initially not his intent. His family had already returned to France earlier, as his children wanted to start their college education in their native county and wife Claudine had accompanied them to set up home in Paris. However, it also turned out that his transient lifestyle had taken its toll on the marriage, causing the couple to drift apart, and it was decided upon his return to enter into a \"living apart together\" relationship, which allowed for an \"enormous freedom and sincerity\" without \"demands and frustrations\" for both spouses, according to the artist.[122] Additionally, Giraud had met Isabelle Champeval during a book signing in Venice, Italy in February 1984, and entered into a relationship with her in 1987, which resulted in the birth of second son Raphaël in 1989. Giraud\\'s marriage with Claudine was legally ended in December 1994, without much drama according to Giraud, as both spouses had realized that \"each wanted something different out of life\".[15] Exemplary of the marriage ending without any ill will was, that Claudine was still emphatically acknowledged for her contributions in the 1997 artbook \"Blueberry\\'s\",[123] and the documentary made for the occasion of its release. Giraud and Isabelle were married on 13 May 1995, and the union resulted in their second child, daughter Nausicaa, the same year.[6] For Giraud his second marriage was of such great personal importance, that he henceforth considered his life divided in a pre-Isabelle part and a post-Isabelle part, having coined his second wife \"the key to the whole grand design\".[124] Isabelle\\'s sister and Giraud\\'s sister-in-law, Claire, became a regular contributor as colorist on Giraud\\'s latter-day work.[125]\\nThe changes in his personal life were also accompanied with changes in his business holdings during 1988–1990. His co-founded publishing house Gentiane/Aedena went into receivership in 1988, going bankrupt a short time thereafter. The American subsidiary Starwatcher Graphics followed in its wake around the turn of the millennium,[112] partly because it was a shared marital possession of the original Giraud couple and partly because the publication efforts of his work in the United States had run its course. Also in 1988, Giraud sold his shares in Les Humanoïdes Associés to Fabrice Giger, thereby severing his formal ownership ties with that publishing house as well, though it remained the regular publisher of his Mœbius work from the Métal hurlant era, including L\\'Incal and some other later titles such as the sequel to The Airtight Garage, \"L\\'Homme du Ciguri\" in 1995. Together with Claudine he founded Stardom in 1990, his first true family operated business without any other third-party participation according to Giraud,[126] with the 1525-copy limited mini art portfolio \"Mockba - carnet de bord\" becoming the company\\'s first recorded publication in September the same year.[127] Apart from being a publishing house, it was concurrently an art gallery, located on 27 Rue Falguière, 75015 Paris, organizing themed exhibitions on a regular basis. In 1997, the company was renamed Moebius Production – singular, despite the occasional and erroneous use of the plural, even by the company itself.[128] The company, in both publishing and art gallery iterations, is as of 2023 still being run by Isabelle Giraud who had taken over the function of publishing editor and co-ownership from Claudine (explaining the renaming of the company), after the latter\\'s marriage with Giraud was dissolved in 1994, and her sister Claire.[129]\\nThe first thing Giraud did creatively upon his return was to finish up on the Blueberry album \"Arizona Love\" on his own after his longtime writing partner Jean-Michel Charlier had died on 10 July 1989. Due to his intimate twenty-five year familiarity with both the series and its writer, it was a foregone conclusion that Giraud would from then on take on the scripting of the main Blueberry series as well, especially since it was already agreed upon in the \"contracts signed with Jean-Michel\" that \"the survivor would take over the series\".[61] Stunned by the sudden death of his longtime co-worker though, he could not bring himself to work on the art for Blueberry afterwards for nearly five years before he embarked on Blueberry again as artist. Giraud stated that the series had lost its \"father\", and that the \"mother needed time to mourn\".[130] Nonetheless, he did embark on the Marshal Blueberry spin-off series in 1990 as writer (leaving the artwork firstly to William Vance and subsequently to Michel Rouge\\xa0[fr]), wanting to pay homage to the legacy of his late writing partner by creating a story in his spirit, or as Giraud had put it, \"{A]nd [I] said to myself: Well, I\\'m going to see if I\\'m able to write a story à la Charlier. So I wrote this scenario, not too bad, but quite traditional, quite classic.\"[131] In similar vein, Giraud took up the writing for the other Charlier/Giraud western creation, Jim Cutlass, that Charlier had actually been in the process of revitalizing in the year before his death, and for which he had already contracted Christian Rossi\\xa0[fr] for the artwork, besides having already started on the scenario. After having added six more volumes to the once one-shot series, the series – which he, as explained above, had published at publisher Casterman instead of (western) house-publisher Dargud – folded in 1999 due to the fact that it was not nearly as commercially successful as Blueberry had been.\\nUnder his \"Mœbius\" pseudonym, Giraud concurrently continued to work on The Aedena Cycle and the Madwoman of the Sacred Heart trilogy, both of which started in the US and completed in 2001 and 1998 respectively, after which he concentrated on Blueberry\\'s \"OK Corral\" cycle, started in 1994 upon his return to France. While Giraud was in the midst of \"OK Corral\" cycle, he also embarked on a new sequel cycle of his acclaimed Incal main series, called Après l\\'Incal (After the Incal). Yet, after he had penciled the first outing in the series, \"Le nouveau rêve\",[132] he found himself confronted with \"too many things that attract me, too many desires in all the senses\", causing him to be no longer able to \"devote myself to the bande dessinée as befitting a professional in the traditional sense\". Despite repeated pleas to convince Giraud otherwise, it left writer Jodorowsky with no other recourse than to start anew with a new artist.[133] This insight had repercussions though, as Giraud, after he had finished the \"OK Corral\" cycle in 2005, no longer continued to produce comics and/or art on a commercial base, but rather on a project and/or personal base, usually under the aegis of his own publishing house Mœbius Production.\\nAs Mœbius Production, Giraud published from 2000 to 2010 Inside Mœbius (French text despite English title), an illustrated autobiographical fantasy in six hardcover volumes totaling 700 pages.[8] Pirandello-like, he appears in cartoon form as both creator and protagonist trapped within the story alongside his younger self and several longtime characters such as Blueberry, Arzak (the latest re-spelling of the Arzach character\\'s name), Major Grubert (from The Airtight Garage) and others.\\nJean Giraud drew the first of the two-part volume of the XIII series titled \"La Version Irlandaise\" (\"The Irish Version\") from a script by Jean Van Hamme,[134] to accompany the second part by the regular team Jean Van Hamme–William Vance, \"Le dernier round\" (\"The Last Round\"). Both parts were published on the same date (13 November 2007)[135] and were the last ones written by Van Hamme before Yves Sente took over the series.[136] The contribution was also a professional courtesy to the series\\' artist, Vance, who had previously provided the artwork for the first two titles in the by Giraud written Marshall Blueberry spin-off series.\\nLate in life, Giraud also decided to revive his seminal Arzak character in an elaborate new adventure series; the first (and last in hindsight) volume of a planned trilogy, Arzak l\\'arpenteur, appeared in 2010.[137] He also added to the Airtight Garage series with two volumes entitled \"Le chasseur déprime\" (2008[138]) and \"Major\" (2011[139]), as well as the art book \"La faune de Mars\" (2011[140]), the latter two initially released in a limited, 1000 copy French only, print run by Mœbius Production. By this time, Giraud created his comic art on a specialized graphic computer tablet, as its enlargement features had become an indispensable aid, because of his failing eyesight.\\nCreating comics became increasingly difficult for Giraud, as his eyesight started to fail him in his last years, having undergone severe surgery in 2010 to stave off blindness in his left eye, and it was mainly for this reason that Giraud increasingly concentrated on creating single-piece art, both as \"Gir\" and as \"Mœbius\", on larger canvases on either commission basis or under the aegis of Mœbius Production.[141] Much of the latter artwork was from 2005 onward, alongside older original art Giraud still had in his possession, sold by the company for considerable prices in specialized comic auctions at such auction houses like Artcurial,[142] Hôtel Drouot[143] and Millon & Associés.[144]\\nAs already indicated above, Giraud had throughout his entire career made illustrations for books, magazines, music productions[31] (though playing the piano and electric guitar, Giraud was, unlike his second son Raphaël, regrettably not a creative musician himself by his own admission, but did have a lifelong fascination with jazz[145]), but also promotional art for commercial institutions such as banks and corporations. A notable early example of the latter, concerned the Blueberry art he created in 1978 for the Spanish jeans manufacturer Lois Jeans & Jackets; Aside from being traditionally run as an advertisement in numerous magazines, it was also blown up to gigantic, mural-like dimensions and as posters plastered on walls and billboards in several places all around Paris. As book illustrator, Giraud illustrated for example the 1987 first edition of the science fiction novel \"Project Pendulum\" by Robert Silverberg,[146] and the 1994 French edition[147] of the novel \"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coelho. The subsequent year Giraud followed up in the same vein as the Coelho novel, with his cover and interior illustrations for a French 1995 reprint of \"Ballades\" from the French medieval poet François Villon,[148] itself followed by similar work for Jean-Jacques Launier\\xa0[fr]\\'s 2001 new-age novel \"La mémoire de l\\'âme\".[149] Much of this non-comic art, including the one for Lois has been reproduced in the artbooks that were released over the years.\\nGiraud was in mid-1990s approached by two video game developers to provide the box cover art for the video games that were released in 1995; the first one concerned the Fade to Black video game developed by the US Delphine Software International, whereas the second one concerned Panzer Dragoon video game developed by the Japanese Sega Corporation. And while Giraud was by now the well established Mœbius artist in both countries, he was only asked to contribute the box cover art for the two video game releases, and nothing beyond. A few years later though, he was also asked to contribute to later games as a concept artist.\\nIn 1999, Giraud\\'s illustrations appeared in a soft cover edition of Dante Alighieri\\'s La Divina Commedia, published by the Nuages Gallery in Milan. As \"Mœbius\" he illustrated the \"Paradiso\" volume, while the two others, \"Inferno\" and \"Purgatorio\", were illustrated by Lorenzo Mattotti and Milton Glaser respectively.[150] The edition was published under the Mœbius name. Giraud\\'s illustrations for \"Paradiso\" take heavy inspiration from the engravings of the Divine Comedy by Gustave Doré, whose work he had discovered in his grandparents\\' library and learned to appreciate in his early formative years, with compositions often approaching an exact match. Giraud acknowledged this influence directly, praising Doré\\'s work and remarking how he sometimes literally used tracing paper to sketch compositions.[151] Though another prominent example of Giraud\\'s non-comic book work, the influences from his science fiction and fantasy comics shine through. The illustrations, with vivid colors and space-age headresses, are distinctly rendered in the Mœbius mode.[152]\\nAn out-of-the-ordinary latter-day contribution as such, constituted his illustrations as \"Mœbius\" for the Thursday 6 March 2008 issue of the Belgian newspaper Le Soir. His illustrations accompanied news articles throughout the newspaper, providing a Mœbiusienne look on events. In return, the newspaper, for the occasion entitled \"Le Soir par (by) Mœbius\", featured two half-page editorials on the artist (pp.\\xa020 & 37).\\nUnder the names Giraud, Gir and Mœbius, he also wrote several comics for other comic artists as listed below, and the early ones included Jacques Tardi[153] and Claude Auclair.[154] Aside from writing for other comic artists, he also wrote story outlines for the movies Les Maîtres du temps, Internal Transfer, Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland and  Thru the Moebius Strip as outlined further down the line.\\nAs author on personal title, Giraud has – apart from his own bande dessinée scripts – written philosophical poetry that accompanied his art in his Mœbius artbooks of the 1980s and 1990s. He also wrote the \"Story Notes\" editorials for the American Epic publications, providing background information on his work contained therein. In 1998, he took time off to write his autobiography, Moebius-Giraud: Histoire de mon double.[155]\\nTron was not a big hit. The movie went out in theaters in the same week as E.T. and, oh, that was a disaster for it. There was also Blade Runner and Star Trek that summer so it was a battle of giants. Tron was a piece of energy trying to survive. It is still alive. It survives. And the new movie is what Steven wanted to do back then but at that time CG was very odd and we were pioneers. I almost did the first computer-animated feature after that, it was called Star Watcher, we had the story, we had the preparation done, we were ready to start. But it came apart; the company did not give us the approval. It was too far, the concept to do everything in computer animation. We were waiting, waiting, and then our producer died in a car accident. Everything collapsed. That was my third contribution to animation and my worst experience. Les Maîtres du temps is a strange story, it\\'s a small movie, and cheap — incredibly cheap –it was more than independent. When I saw the film for the first time I was ashamed. It\\'s not a Disney movie, definitely. But because the movie has, maybe a flavor, a charm, it is still alive after all that time. More than 35 years now and it is still here.Giraud\\'s friend Jean-Claude Mézières has divulged in the 1970s that their very first outing into the world of cinema concerned a 1957 animated Western, unsurprisingly considering their shared passion for the genre, \"Giraud, with his newfound prestige because of his trip to Mexico [note: Mézières had wanted to accompany his friend to Mexico, but was not able to raise the money], started a pro career at Cœurs Valiants, but together with two other friends we tackled a very ambitious project first: a cartoon western for which Giraud drew the sets and the main characters. Alas, rather disappointingly, we had to stop after only 45 seconds!\"[156] Any further movie aspirations Giraud, who himself had considered the effort \"too laborious\",[157] might have had entertained had to wait until he received the 1974 invitation of Alejandro Jodorowsky to work on his planned adaptation of Frank Herbert\\'s Dune, which was however abandoned in pre-production.[158] Jodorowsky\\'s Dune, a 2013 American-French documentary directed by Frank Pavich, explores Jodorowsky\\'s unsuccessful attempt. Giraud, a non-English speaker at the time, later admitted that the prospect of moving over to Los Angeles filled him with trepidation, initially causing him to procrastinate. It was friend Philippe Druillet (with whom he would co-found Les Humanoïdes Associés later that year) who pushed him to up and go, which he did by going AWOL again from his job at Pilote. Giraud was grateful for Druillet pushing him as he found that he reveled in his first Hollywood experience.[157] The project took nine months before it fell apart, but Giraud\\'s presence was not always required, giving him ample time to return to France on several occasions, to pursue his other work, such as his work for L\\'Écho des savanes and, most importantly, to firstly finish up on Blueberry\\'s \"Angel Face\", which he ultimately did in record time, this time formally quitting Pilote afterwards.[52]\\nDespite Jodowowsky\\'s project falling through, it had attracted the attention of other movie makers. One of them was Ridley Scott who managed to reassemble a large part of Jodorowsky\\'s original creative team, including Giraud, for his 1979 science fiction thriller Alien. Hired as a concept artist, Giraud\\'s stay on the movie lasted only a few days, as he had obligations elsewhere. Nonetheless, his designs for the Nostromo crew attire, and their spacesuits in particular, were almost one-on-one adopted by Scott and appearing onscreen as designed,[159] resulting in what Giraud had coined \"two weeks of work and ten years of fallout in media and advertising\".[157] Scott did explicitly acknowledge \"Mœbius\" for his contributions in the special features for the movie in the Alien Quadrilogy home media collection. Scott was taken with Giraud\\'s art, having cited \"The Long Tomorrow\" as an influence on his second major movie Blade Runner of 1982 (see below), and invited him again for both this, and his subsequent third major movie Legend of 1985, which Giraud had to decline in both cases for, again, obligations elsewhere. He especially regretted not having been able to work on the latter movie, having deemed it \"very good\",[157] and it was still on his mind as late as 2010, as he directly referred to the movie when he made his \"unicorn\" statement regarding his legacy, quoted below.\\n1981 saw the release of the animated film Heavy Metal, produced by Ivan Reitman. The heavily \"Arzach\"-inspired last, \"Taarna\", section of the movie, has led to the persistent misconception, especially held in the United States, that Giraud had provided characters and situations for the segment, albeit uncredited.[160][161] Giraud however, had already emphatically squashed that particular misconception himself on an early occasion, \"I had absolutely nothing to do with it,\" stated the artist in 1982, \"Sure, the people who made the movie were inspired by quite a few things from \"Arzach\",\" further explaining that, while the American producers had indeed intended to use the artist\\'s material from the eponymous magazine, there were legalities involved between the American and French mother magazines, because the latter had financial interests in Laloux\\'s below mentioned Les Maîtres du temps that was concurrently in development, and in which Giraud was very much involved with. The American producers went ahead regardless of the agreements made between them and Métal hurlant. While not particularly pleased with the fact, Giraud was amused when third parties wanted to sue the Americans on his behalf. Giraud however, managed to convince his editor-in-chief Jean-Pierre Dionnet (one of his co-founding friends of Métal hurlant) to let the issue slide, as he found \"all that fuss with lawyers\" not worth his while, aside from the incongruous circumstance that the French magazine was running advertisements for the American movie.[162]\\nStill, Alien led to two other movie assignments in 1982, this time as both concept and storyboard artist. The first one concerned the Disney science fiction movie Tron, whose director Steven Lisberger specifically requested Giraud, after he had discovered his work in Heavy Metal magazine.[157] The second assignment concerned Giraud\\'s collaboration with director René Laloux to create the science fiction feature-length animated movie Les Maîtres du temps (released in English as Time Masters) based on a novel by Stefan Wul. He and director Rene Laloux shared the award for Best Children\\'s Film at the Fantafestival that year.[161] For the latter, Giraud was also responsible for the poster art and the comic adaption of the same title, with some of his concept and storyboard art featured in a \"making-of\" book to boot.[163] Excepting Les Maîtres du temps, Giraud\\'s movie work had him travel to Los Angeles for longer periods of time.\\nOutside his actual involvement with motion pictures, Giraud was in this period of time also occasionally commissioned to create poster art for, predominantly European, movies. Movies for which Giraud, also as \"Mœbius\", created poster art included, Touche pas à la femme blanche\\xa0! (1974 as Gir, three 120x160 cm versions), S*P*Y*S (1974, unsigned, American movie but poster art for release in France), Vous ne l\\'emporterez pas au paradis\\xa0[fr] (1975, unsigned), Les Chiens (1979 as Mœbius, rejected, used as cover for Taboo 4), Tusk (1980 as Giraud, a Jodorowsky film), and La Trace\\xa0[fr] (1983 as Mœbius).\\nAs his two 1982 movies coincided with the end of his Métal hurlant days and his departure for Tahiti shortly thereafter, this era can be seen as Giraud\\'s \"first Hollywood period\", especially since the next project he embarked on entailed a movie in which he was very much invested as initiator, writer and producer as well, contrary to the movies he hitherto had worked upon as a gun-for-hire.\\nWhile Giraud was residing in Appel-Guéry\\'s commune, he, together with Appel-Guéry and another member of the commune, Paula Salomon, came up with a story premise for a major animated science fiction movie called Internal Transfer, which was endowed with the English title Starwatcher – after which Giraud\\'s American publishing house was named. Slated for the production was Arnie Wong, whom Giraud had met during the production of Tron (and, incidentally, one of the animators of the vaunted \"Taarna\" segment of the Heavy Metal movie[164]), and it was actually Disney whom Giraud offered the production first. Disney, at the time not believing in the viability of such a production in animation, declined. Another member of the commune fronted some of the money for the project to proceed, and the production was moved to Wong\\'s animation studio in Los Angeles. It was this circumstance that provided Giraud with his alibi to leave Appel-Guéry\\'s commune and settle in California – and the reason why he had to decline Ridley Scott for his Legend movie. Much to Giraud\\'s disappointment and frustration though, the project eventually fell apart for several extraneous reasons, most notably for lack of funding, as related above by the artist.[157] Still, the concept art he provided for the project served as the basis for his first collaboration with Geof Darrow, whom he had also met previously on the production of Tron, on their 1985 City of Fire art portfolio. Some of the concept art was reprinted in the art book \"Made in L.A.\".[72]\\nYet, despite this failure to launch, it did lead to his, what can be considered, \"second Hollywood period\" in his \"American period\". Concurrent with his career as a comic artist in the United States, invitations followed to participate as concept artist on Masters of the Universe (1987), Willow (1988), The Abyss (1989), and finally Yutaka Fujioka\\'s Japanese animated feature film Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland (1989), for which he was not only the conceptual designer, but also the story writer. It was for this movie that Giraud resided in Japan for an extended period of time.[161][157] Giraud followed up on his involvement with Little Nemo by writing the first two outings of the 1994-2000 French graphic novel series of the same name, drawn by Bruno Marchand\\xa0[fr].[165]\\nHis definitive return to France in 1989 marked the beginning of Giraud\\'s third and last movie period. In January 1992, the French newspaper Le Monde reported on a computer animated movie that was under development at the company Vidéosystem. It actually concerned a second attempt to get Starwatcher on the silver screen,[166] but just like its 1984 predecessor, it eventually failed to come to fruition. Afterwards, Giraud made original character designs and did visual development for Warner Bros.\\' partly animated 1996 movie Space Jam. 1997 saw his participation as concept artist on Luc Besson\\'s science fiction epic The Fifth Element, which was of great personal importance for Giraud as it meant working together with his lifelong friend Jean-Claude Mézières, coming full circle after their very first aborted 1957 attempt at creating a motion picture. The 2005 documentary made for this occasion was testament to the great friendship both men had for each other. Concurrently, Giraud\\'s oldest child, daughter Hélène, was employed on the movie in a similar function, albeit uncredited, though Giraud had stated with fatherly pride, \"Yes, she had cooperated in a truly engaged manner. She started at the crack of dawn, and only went home in the evening, after the whole team had stopped working.\"[167] Giraud\\'s experience on the movie was however somewhat marred by the 2004 lawsuit publisher Les Humanoïdes Associés (ostensibly on his behalf like the earlier 1981 intent which Giraud had then successfully prevented) and Alejandro Jodorowsky leveled against Besson for alleged plagiarism of L\\'Incal, a lawsuit they lost.[168]\\n2005 saw the release of the Chinese movie Thru the Moebius Strip, based on a story by Giraud who also served as the production designer and the co-producer, and which reunited him with Arnie Wong, whereas his stint as concept designer on the 2012 animated science fiction movie Strange Frame, has become Giraud\\'s final recorded motion picture contribution.[169]\\nIn 1991 his graphic novel short, \"Cauchemar Blanc\", was cinematized by Mathieu Kassovitz, winning Kassovitz (but not Giraud) two film awards.[170] With Arzak Rhapsody\\xa0[fr], Giraud saw his ambitions as a full-fledged animation movie maker at least in part fulfilled. A 2002 series for French television broadcaster France 2, it consisted of fourteen four minute long animated vignettes, based on Giraud\\'s seminal character, for which he did the writing, drawings and co-production. Young daughter Nausicaa had voice-over appearances in three of the episodes together with her father.[171]\\n\"The Lost Dutchman\\'s Mine\" story cycle of the Blueberry series was adapted for the screen in 2004, by Jan Kounen, as Blueberry: L\\'expérience secrète. Three prior attempts to bring Blueberry to the silver screen had fallen through two decades earlier; in 1986 Charlier disclosed how American actor Martin Kove had actually already been signed to play the titular role – with whom Kove shared a remarkable resemblance at the time – for the first two early-1980s attempts, which were both based on the \"Confederate Gold\" cycle. It was Kove who introduced the two Blueberry creators to would-be American film producers on both occasions. The first attempt failed because American producers intended a complete script rewrite turning Blueberry into a completely unrecognizable standard western. The second attempt suffered even worse as its American producer, \"inspired\" by the success of the 1981 movie Raiders of the Lost Ark, wanted to turn the project into a Raiders 2.0, set in the Yucatán peninsula, complete with Aztec warriors and pyramids and featuring a daring escape in a zeppelin-type airship. Helped by his background in law, an aghast Charlier instructed Giraud to sabotage the project as much as possible and the  Blueberry creators eventually managed to buy back the rights for US$30,000. Already mentioned by Charlier in his 1986 interview, Kove had even traveled to Europe to shoot some test-footage scenes from the comic series in this role in order to entice potential investors, and that some of it was still in his possession as it turned out decades later. Convinced that the project was a viable one, Kove has also revealed in 2014 that he, together with the two Blueberry creators, tried to save it by putting up his own money as well when the project was falling apart due to arguments about funding among European/American would-be producers – to no avail however,[172] which was a slightly different version of events as had been related by Charlier. The third (and last) attempt concerned a European only endeavor, which had at one point actually involved Sergio Leone, according to Charlier,[173] and was actually conceived as a television movie series and slated to be produced by the Swiss/French/Belgian production/distribution company Technisonor,[174] more faithfully adhering – than the later 2004 film adaptation – to the main comic series and intended to span the \"Iron Horse\" through the \"Rehabilitation\" story cycles. That 1983 attempt petered out without so much as a whimper, most likely due to lack of interest on the part of European investors.\\n2010 saw the adaptation of \"La planète encore\" (\"The Still Planet\"), a short story from the Le Monde d\\'Edena universe – and which had won him his 1991 Eisner Award – into an animated short. Moebius Production served as a production company, with Isabelle Giraud serving as one of its producers. Giraud himself was one of the two directors of the short and it premiered at the «Mœbius transe forme» exposition at the Fondation Cartier pour l\\'art contemporain in Paris.[175]\\nIn November 2021 it was announced Oscar winner Taika Waititi would direct the screen adaptation of Jodorowsky/Moebius\\'s graphic novel The Incal and co-write the script with frequent collaborators Jemaine Clement and Peter Warren.[176]\\nTwo years after he had provided box cover art for two video games, Giraud was approached for more substantial video game contributions when developer Arxel Tribe asked Giraud to become a concept designer for their 1997 Pilgrim: Faith as a Weapon game they had in development. It actually reunited Giraud with Paulo Coelho on whose 1987 work The Pilgrimage the game was based and who also responsible for its adaptation, and for whom Giraud had illustrated his Alchemist French-edition novel three years earlier. As Mœbius, Giraud designed among others the costumes for the game.\\nSeven years later the Japanese 2004 video game Seven Samurai 20XX was released for which Giraud was asked to provide the character concept designs. This was his last known video game contribution.\\nEssentially, the work he had been asked to perform for these two video games, did not differ that much from the movie work Giraud had done since the 1979 movie Alien in a near-similar function.\\nPart of the \"many desires\" that increasingly attracted Giraud later in life, steering him away from creating traditional bandes dessinées, was his personal fascination and involvement with the many exhibitions dedicated to his work, that started to proliferate from the mid-1990s onward not only in native France, but internationally as well, causing him to frequently travel abroad, among others to Japan, for extended periods of time, with the prestigious high-profile 2010 «Mœbius transe forme» exposition in Paris becoming the apotheosis.[177]\\nPosthumous exhibitions\\nIn 1988 Giraud was chosen, among 11 other winners of the prestigious Grand Prix of the Angoulême Festival, to illustrate a postage stamp set issued on the theme of communication.[193]\\nGiraud\\'s working methods were various and adaptable ranging from etchings, white and black illustrations, to work in colour of the ligne claire genre and water colours.[194] Giraud\\'s solo Blueberry works were sometimes criticized by fans of the series because the artist dramatically changed the tone of the series as well as the graphic style.[195] However, Blueberry\\'s early success was also due to Giraud\\'s innovations, as he did not content himself with following earlier styles, an important aspect of his development as an artist.[196]\\nTo distinguish between work by Giraud and Moebius, Giraud used a brush for his own work and a pen when he signed his work as Moebius. Giraud was known for being an astonishingly fast draftsman.[197]\\nHis style has been compared to the Nouveaux réalistes, exemplified in his turn from the bowdlerized realism of Hergé\\'s Tintin towards a grittier style depicting sex, violence and moral bankruptcy.[2]\\nAided with the use of mind-expanding substances in the first part of his career, Giraud had cultivated various New Age type philosophies throughout his career, such as Guy-Claude Burger\\'s instinctotherapy, which influenced his creation of the comic book series Le Monde d\\'Edena.[2][8] However, he dispensed with the use of drugs for the time being himself – though not condemning them, quite the contrary, as Giraud considered them a gateway to a hidden dreamworld ever since he was introduced in 1974 to the writings of Carlos Castaneda, and having started again with the use of marijuana in the last decade of his life, after a long abstinence – and outside teachers, or \"gurus\" as he himself had coined them, after his stay on Tahiti, instead continuing to seek deeper truths within himself on his own accord.[198] However, it also negatively influenced his relationship with Philippe Charlier, heir and steward of his father\\'s Blueberry co-creation and legacy, who had no patience whatsoever with Giraud\\'s New Age predilections, particularly for his admitted fondness for mind-expanding substances. As 50% brand co-owner, Charlier jr. has vetoed several later Blueberry project proposals by Giraud, the aforementioned Blueberry 1900 project in particular, precisely for these reasons, as they were to prominently feature, Castaneda inspired, substance-induced scenes, going even as far as to (successfully) threaten Giraud with a lawsuit to thwart his intentions.[57][199]\\nIn the documentary MetaMoebius (2010), Giraud claims his different styles may stem from his short-sightedness. When drawing without glasses he is more attuned to fine details but disconnected from the external world, but when drawing with glasses on he does not get into details but is more aware of the big picture. He often starts with glasses on to have a global perspective then later continues without glasses.\\nGiraud died in Montrouge, on 10 March 2012, aged 73, after a long battle with cancer.[200][201] His death was expedited by a lymphoma-induced pulmonary embolism.[202] Fellow comic artist François Boucq (incidentally, the artist pegged by Giraud in person for the artwork of the canceled Blueberry 1900 project) stated that Mœbius was a \"master of realist drawing with a real talent for humour, which he was still demonstrating with the nurses when I saw him in his hospital bed a fortnight ago\".[203] Giraud was buried on 15 March, in the Montparnasse Cemetery,[204] after the funeral services, held in the Saint Clotilde Basilica. Many friends and representatives from the Franco-Belgian comic world and beyond attended the services, mirroring Giraud\\'s entire career in the industry. The French government was represented by its Minister of Culture, Frédéric Mitterrand,[205] nephew of the former President of France François Mitterrand, who had personally awarded Giraud with his first civilian knighthood twenty-seven years earlier.[206] Giraud left his estate to his second wife Isabelle and his four children.[207]\\nThroughout his entire career, Jean Giraud gave numerous interviews both in Europe as well as in the United States, but it is the series of interview sessions conducted over the course of four decades by comics journalist Numa Sadoul that stand out for its all encompassing scope of Giraud\\'s entire career. Sadoul took a particular interest in the artist and followed the career of Giraud closely from the mid-1970s onward until the latter\\'s death in 2012, conducting extensive in-depth interviews with the artist throughout this period of time with approximate two-decade intervals, which resulted in three consecutive, chronologically organized interview books, Mister Mœbius et Docteur Gir (1976), Mœbius: Entretiens avec Numa Sadoul (1991), and Docteur Mœbius et Mister Gir: Entretiens avec Jean Giraud (2015, see below for bibliographical details on all editions), the latter two being each an edited, updated and expanded version of the previous one – and each title incidentally, featuring an entirely different selection of art. Excepting parts of the first book in SCHTROUMPF: Les cahiers de la BD (issue 25, July 1974), none of the later interviews had seen prior magazine publication, be it in part or in whole. The SCHTROUMPF interview excerpt, was by Giraud poured into a humorous eight-page autobiographical black & white comic (pp.\\xa08–16). The comic, entitled \"Entretien avec Jean Giraud\", or \"Mœbius Circa \\'74\" as it is known in English, was however only reprinted in the 2015 edition of Sadoul\\'s book as a preface (but omitted from the 2023 English translation of that edition), and in hindsight a precursor to Giraud\\'s autobiographical Inside Mœbius comic books. The similarity had not been lost on the artist himself, after he had embarked on the Inside Mœbius series and realized, \"Merde, that is exactly like the comic I have done with Numa!\"[208]\\nNoteworthy were the testimonials Sadoul collected from seminal persons in Giraud\\'s life and career which included among others his mother, first wife Claudine (of these two the only known published ones[7]), his mentor Jijé and many others, as well as the fact that Giraud spoke more freely about the aspects of his life and career (including the more contentious ones, such as his mind-expanding substance use and his extremely strained relationship with the aforementioned Philippe Charlier, which had over time deteriorated into open hatred) than was commonplace in his more generic interviews, or even in his own, hereafter mentioned, autobiography. For editorial reasons, Sadoul omitted some of the outside testimonials from the second edition for his third. In the third installment (2023, pp. 254-255), Giraud also openly discussed his fear of a painful death because of his progressing cancer.\\nPosthumously published, the 2015 title was fully sanctioned and endorsed by Giraud\\'s widow Isabelle (who provided a foreword – praising Sadoul for his friendship and tenacity – family pictures, privately created art and additional details on her husband\\'s last two years of his life) and has therefore become the closest approximation of an \"official biography\" of the artist when discounting his own Inside Moebius autobiographical comic and his precursory text autobiography Histoire de mon double. The latter, published as an unillustrated paperback in 1999 was the \"biography written by Giraud on Mœbius & vice versa\",[209] but constituted what Sadoul in his 2015 edition has coined a \"snapshot in time\", aside from the obvious fact that the last phase of the artist\\'s career was not covered. Giraud himself considered his \"enhanced\" autobiography on which he had worked for a year, a \"funny\" piece of work, conceding that accuracy was left to be desired as he could not be bothered to correct mistakes made therein, finding \"flavor\" in the small inaccuracies, and also admitting that he gave his work only a cursory glance afterwards.[155]\\nAuthor Sadoul accounted for his work in the introduction of the 2015 edition where he summarized that the interviews for the first edition took three days in March 1974 and in August and September 1975 – and thus shortly before Giraud achieved fame in his second \"Mœbius\" career – at the artist\\'s home in Fontenay-sous-Bois. Having kept more detailed records, the second edition took in total 19 hours and 45 minutes of interviews conducted between 18 and 21 October 1988 at Sadoul\\'s home in Cagnes-sur-Mer (for which Giraud and his future wife Isabelle especially traveled from Paris), augmented with an additional two hours at Giraud\\'s home in Paris on 17 August 1989. The third edition accounted for a further 10 hours and 48 minutes worth of interviews, conducted between 15 September 2000 and 28 December 2011, either at Giraud\\'s home in Paris or over the telephone. Sadoul acknowledged that the three series of interview sessions were snapshots in time of Giraud\\'s life and career, causing the artist to occasionally contradict himself in later life – something Giraud himself actually addressed in a humorous fashion in his Inside Moebius comics by regularly confronting his older self with his younger versions – , but chose not to redact or edit such earlier made statements (at most adding short, clarifying editorial annotations), instead transcribing these exactly as made at the time. Sadoul\\'s reasoning was that by doing so, it reflected truthfully the spiritual development the artist had undergone throughout his career.\\nDespite the worldwide renown Giraud/Mœbius has acquired, Sadoul\\'s biography has until late-2023 only seen two other-language editions, a German 2nd edition, and a Japanese 3rd edition release (also see below for bibliographic details). It has limited the appeal of the book as none of the three languages are all that easily accessible to the wider readership beyond the three respective language areas alone. Yet, a more universally accessible 3rd edition English-language release had already been solicited by Dark Horse as early as 12 May 2020.[210] Dark Horse however, kept postponing the release at such a recurring frequency, that fans started to consider the solicitation a bad running gag by Dark Horse and began to wonder if the title would even be released at all. In 2021, after the umpteenth postponement of the release, translator Edward Gauvin, stumbled upon that restarted discussion on the Reddit newsite, and took it upon himself to clarify the reasons for the continuous release delays. He explained that firstly, regular Dark Horse translator for Mœbius works, Diana Schutz, had been temporarily disabled by a wrist operation, and that it took time to find a replacement. Secondly, a first draft was only delivered by Gauvin in late 2019, but the COVID-19 pandemic subsequently threw all kinds of monkey wrenches into Dark Horse\\'s release plans. Thirdly, after Gauvin had submitted his final draft in early 2021, he was asked by Dark Horse to compile a glossary of end-notes for the book, explaining the in the interview sessions casually dropped bande dessinée names and terminology to a US/UK readership, much like Schutz had done for her three-volume Inside Moebius translations. The substantial extra editorial work required by that late Dark Horse request only served to add to the series of release delays.[211] The English-language edition of the book was ultimately released on 13 December 2023 after all.[212]\\nA more traditional first-time biography, titled \"Jean Giraud alias Mœbius\", by French BD publicist Christophe Quillien was shortly afterwards published on 17 May 2024.[213]\\nThey said that I changed their life, \\'You changed my life\\', \\'Your work is why I became an artist\\'. Oh, it makes me happy. But you know at same time I have an internal broom to clean it all up. It can be dangerous to believe it. Someone wrote, \\'Moebius is a legendary artist\\' I[t] put[s] a frame around me. A legend — now I am like a unicorn.Long before his death Giraud had already been coined \"the most influential bandes dessinées artist after Hergé\" by several academic comic scholars,[214][3] and many artists from around the world have cited him as a major influence on their work. Testament to this was the publication of two special homage issues of the French comic journals Casemate\\xa0[fr] (Hors Série 3) and dBD\\xa0[fr] (Hors Série 09) a month after Giraud\\'s death. The original \"Chihuaha Pearl\" album-cover-endowed 84-page Casemate issue featured, aside from an elaborate in-memoriam overview of Giraud\\'s life and career, testimonials from 89 predominantly European comic artists, who often had their testimonials accompanied with their own Giraud/Mœbius-themed art made for the occasion. For the 96-page dBD issue, which came in two cover variants, \"Giraud, mort d\\'un géant\" (\"Giraud, death of a giant\") and \"Mœbius, Adieu à l\\'immortel\" (\"Mœbius: Farewell to an immortal\"), over 100 comic artists, this time added with international overseas artists, contributed art as tribute to the deceased artist.[215] In January 2013, a similarly executed 64-page homage reverse double cover journal, became the first issue of the newly launched Tonnerre De Bulles! comics journal as issue Hors Série 1, which was followed by a similar 76-page Gir/Mœbius-themed double cover issue (Hors Série 5) in October 2015. Both issues were limited to 650 copies.[216]\\nThe testimonials quoted below, gathered from a myriad of other sources, are but a small and far from complete, random selection of all the accolades given to the artist, and presented in no particular order;\\n\"Through Arzach, which dates from 1975, I believe. I only read it in 1980, and it was a big shock. Not only for me. All manga authors were shaken by this work. Unfortunately, when I discovered it, I already had a consolidated style so I couldn\\'t use its influence to enrich my drawing. Even today, I think it has an awesome sense of space. I directed Nausicaä under Mœbius\\'s influence.\"[219][220]\"I fell out of love with American comics, lost interest in the super-hero subject matter, was more interested in the fantasy I saw in the European art.\"[15]\"So it\\'s entirely fair to say, and I\\'ve said it before, that the way Neuromancer-the-novel \"looks\" was influenced in large part by some of the artwork I saw in Heavy Metal. I assume that this must also be true of John Carpenter\\'s Escape from New York, Ridley Scott\\'s Blade Runner, and all other artefacts of the style sometimes dubbed \\'cyberpunk\\'. Those French guys, they got their end in early.\"[221]\"You see it everywhere, it runs through so much you can\\'t get away from it.\"[141]\"When I first saw the work of \\'Mœbius\\' – a.k.a. \\'Gir\\', both noms de plume of Jean Giraud – his fresh science-fiction and fantasy comic art forever altered my perception of the comic medium.\"[77]\"In all his drawings, Mœbius demonstrates a command of many disciplines in art. He is a master draftsman, a superb artist, and more: his vision is original and strong. Since first seeing the Mœbius illustrations in Heavy Metal years ago, I have been impressed and affected by his keen and unusual sense of design, and the distinctive way in which he depicts the fantastic. perhaps what strikes me most of all his work is its sheer beauty–a beauty that has always given me great pleasure.\"\"I read [Métal Hurlant] over and over and envied the French because they had everything I dreamed of in comics – beautifully drawn, visionary and literate comics, for adults. I wanted to make comics like that when I grew up.\"[222]\"He\\'s a unique talent endowed with an extraordinary visionary imagination that\\'s constantly renewed and never vulgar. Moebius disturbs and consoles. He has the ability to transport us into unknown worlds where we encounter unsettling characters. My admiration for him is total. I consider him a great artist, as great as Picasso and Matisse.\"[223]\"The great Moebius died today, but the great Mœbius is still alive. Your body died today, your work is more alive than ever.\"[201]\"I have said for years now — in fact, probably since 2000, when Charles Schulz left us, and there were four — that the three greatest living cartoonists are Robert Crumb, Jacques Tardi, and Jean Giraud. In the last 48 hours, that number has shrunk to two. – Salut, Jean!\"[224]\"France has lost one of its best known artists in the world. In Japan, Italy, in the United States he is an incredible star who influenced world comics. Mœbius will remain part of the history of drawing, in the same right as Dürer or Ingres. He was an incredible producer, he said he wanted to show what eyes do not always see.\"[203]Posthumous awards and honors (usually accepted on behalf of the deceased artist by widow Isabelle Giraud)\\nWith the below referenced posthumous publishing efforts of Dark Horse Books that started in 2016, Giraud has become, along with fellow artist Enki Bilal from his Métal hurlant days, one of the relatively few European graphic novel artists to have the bulk of their body of work translated in the English language.\\nThe English-language versions of many of Mœbius\\' comics have been collected into various editions, beginning with a small series of US graphic novel sized trade paperbacks from HM Communications, Inc., collecting work originally published in its Heavy Metal magazine (the US version of the French original, co-founded by Giraud), and in which Moebius\\' work was introduced to American readership in the 1970s. It has been noted by Taboo Editor-in-Chief Stephen R. Bissette that the quality of the translations of HM Communications had been very poor.[77]\\nHeavy Metal presents (1977–1981)\\nA far more comprehensive effort was undertaken at Marvel Comics under its Epic imprint in the late 1980s and early 1990s, initiated, translated and introduced by Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier. The intent was to collect all comics Giraud had hitherto published in Europe as Mœbius into one single format collection, and in this Epic largely succeeded, when the eventual two – three when counting Blueberry as well – collections had run their courses around 1992. When initiated, the collections were otherwise unaltered published in Great Britain as well, with a lag ranging from a few months to a year, by Titan Books in a smaller print run of 6.000 copies per title – like the previous HM Communications book releases had been – as opposed to the initial 20.000 copies per title release by Epic with a continuous reprint option for those volumes selling out while the Epic publication effort was underway, a relative novelty in the US comic world at the time.[111] However, of the eventual eleven titles in the Fantasies softcover collection, only six (Mœbius 1 - Mœbius 6) were ultimately released by Titan Books. With the exception of Mœbius 9 – Stel (itself a very late addition to the Fantasies collection, being a near simultaneous international 1994 release), Giraud created new cover art for the Marvel/Epic releases, including the Incal (and Blueberry) series. Save for Mœbius 1⁄2 and aside from the covers, it was for the Fantasies collection that stories originally done in black & white in the French source publications, received first time coloring, most notably The Airtight Garage, but excepting the seminal short story \"The Detour\".[39] Remarkably, Epic was aided by outsiders Dark Horse Comics and Graphitti Designs, who each added a volume to the Fantasies collection, adhering to the style and format as set by Epic, in which work was published Marvel/Epic itself apparently deemed too controversial to publish themselves, particularly the 0-volume for its heavy, albeit humorous, phallic theme.\\nThough some purist fans have frowned upon the coloring of the originally black & white stories, the Marvel/Epic Fantasies collection has nevertheless served as the template for similar collections subsequently released in not only native France, but in other countries as well.[255]\\nThe Collected Fantasies of Jean Giraud (1987–1994):\\nThe Incal collection (1988)\\nMœbius\\' magnum opus as such, The Incal, was separately released both in the US and Great Britain in its own mini series, each title collecting two of the original French source publications:\\nThe Marvel/Epic graphic novel releases earned Giraud his three Harvey Awards in the category \"Best American Edition of Foreign Material\" in 1988 (for the Fantasies collection), in 1989 (for The Incal collection) and in 1991 (for the Blueberry collection).\\nThe Silver Surfer (1988–2012)\\nThis miniseries won Giraud his Eisner Award for best finite/limited series in 1989, each comic book issue enjoying a print run of 200,000 copies.[111]\\nArt Books (1989–1995)\\nIn between, Epic Comics did release four stand-alone art book titles, with Chaos and Metallic Memories reproducing most of the 1980 original:[67]\\nThe Elsewhere Prince (1990)\\nWhile Giraud (with Lofficier) was only the co-writer of this US standard comic book mini series, which took place in \"The Airtight Garage\" universe, there was additional art from him featured in short accompanying editorials, as well as one to two page short stories.\\nOnyx Overlord (1992–1993)\\nBy Giraud co-written sequel to The Elsewhere Prince, and like that series, also featuring additional art from his hand. While Giraud was very pleased with Shanower\\'s art for The Elsewhere Prince for its \"naive qualities\" he found very fitting for the story-arc, he was deeply disappointed with Bingham\\'s art for Onyx Overlord, considering the work of the \"old comics veteran\" uninspired and \"truly undignified\", suspecting Bingham did not like the work. Because of this, Giraud decided not to dispatch the already completed scenarios for Logs 5 and 6. Disappointing sales of the European editions left the cycle uncompleted indefinitely.[265]\\nMoebius\\' Airtight Garage (1993)\\nStandard US comic book reissue of the 1987 graphic novel, with some additional art in the editorials.\\nThe Halo Graphic Novel (2006)\\nComprising four chapters, Giraud provided the 16-page art for chapter 4, \"Second Sunrise over New Mombasa\". In the editorial of the novel (p.\\xa099), Giraud explained that son Raphaël\\'s enjoyment of the game series ultimately compelled him to accept an invitation to contribute his art; before penciling the story, he had never played the video games.\\nExcepting The Art of Mœbius, Mœbius 9, Fusion (being Johnny-come-lately\\'s, the latter two were released too late for inclusion, whereas the first one, having been a co-publication, could not for copyright reasons), The Silver Surfer and The Elsewhere Prince/Onyx Overlord, all these volumes were very shortly thereafter reissued by Graphitti Designs – having themselves added a volume to the Collected Fantasies series – as part of their signed and numbered, \"Limited Hardcover Edition\" 1500 copy each collection (in dust jacket), combining these with the similar Blueberry releases by Epic and Catalan Communications, in a single \"Mœbius\" ten-volume complete works anthology release. Excepting the last volume, the Mœbius collection was executed in the standard European graphic novel size. The \"Young Blueberry\" and \"Virtual Meltdown\" anthology titles differed from the others in that they were not printed on high gloss paper, but on matte paper as in the original ComCat/Epic publications, and was in itself a stark indication – aside from the very quick release after the original Marvel/Epic/ComCat individual publications – that the Graphitti Designs release had always been foreseen, resulting in that the original print run of the interior pages for the individual volumes had already accounted for inclusion in the anthology collection as well.\\nMœbius anthology collection (1988–1993)\\nThe Abyss (1989)\\nThis mini comic book series, is the comic adaptation of the eponymous movie. The eight-page editorials in each are dedicated to the production design art Giraud had provided for the movie.\\nConcrete (1990)\\nThis special in the Concrete comic book series, featured the first time, full color publication of the 23-page short story \"The Still Planet\", set in the Edena universe. Accounting for half the contents of the comic book, the story was instrumental in making Mœbius co-winner of the 1991 Eisner Award in the category \"Best Single Issue\".\\nDark Horse Presents (1992-1993)\\nCity of Fire art portfolio (1993)\\nThe fourth Mœbius outing of Dark Horse concerned a reissue of the art portfolio La Cité Feu – a collaborative art project of Giraud with Geoff Darrow – Starwatcher Graphics had released as an English language (for the introduction folio) \"Limited American lux edition\" version of 100 signed and numbered copies in January 1985 under its original title, alongside the French 950 copy original by Aedena.[269] Some of the art is reproduced in the aforementioned Fusion art book by Epic.\\nMœbius collection (1996)\\nHaving added the 0-volume to the Collected Fantasies series in 1990, Dark Horse Comics too decided to release a Mœbius specific – meaning without his Western work – collection themselves, this time executed in the standard US comic book-sized format and soliciting the editorial input from Jean-Marc Lofficier who had already done so for the previous efforts. Though much of the contents was essentially a recapitulation of the Marvel/Epic publications, Lofficier made use of the opportunity to add work Mœbius had created after the Marvel/Epic publications had run its course, such as the story The Man from the Ciguri (a sequel to The Airtight Garage) and the first two outings of the Madwomen of the sacred Heart series.\\nMœbius Library (2016-)\\nTwenty years later, in April 2016, Dark Horse announced an ambitious project called the \"Mœbius Library\" to be released by its book division in American graphic novel hardcover format[272] – even though the later added Doctor Moebius and Mister Gir title became executed as a softcover release. The stated intent was to predominantly publish latter day work by Mœbius in conjunction with, and originally published under the auspices of, his own publishing house \"Mœbius Production\", headed after his death in 2012 by second wife Isabelle. The first title was released in October 2016, which promptly won an Eisner Award.\\nHalo Graphic Novel (2021)\\nKitchen Sink Press was a publisher of underground comics, explaining the French Ticklers series, and had connotations with HM Communications, adopting some of its artist after the latter had become defunct. Concurrently they had merged with Tundra Publishing in 1993, explaining the Visions of Arzach anthology art book.\\nFrench Ticklers (1989-1990)\\nA short-lived comic book series, collecting work from French underground comic artists, including Giraud. Giraud\\'s contributions concerned some of his early \"Mœbius\" work he had produced for Hara-Kiri in 1963–1964. Graphitti Designs subsequently collected all early Mœbius work in their 1992 Collected Fantasies contribution as \"Mœbius ½\". All three black & white issues featured a (color) cover by Mœbius.\\nLegends of Arzach (1992)\\nThis original American publication consists of six, 9.2\"x12.2\" sized, art portfolios, each of them containing an introduction plate, a by Giraud illustrated booklet featuring a short story by R.J.M. Lofficier, set in the Arzach universe, and eight art prints by American comic artists, paying homage to Mœbius\\' seminal character, 48 in total. Lofficier later expanded upon his short stories in his 2000 book title by iBOOKS, mentioned below.\\n\"Visions of Arzach\" (1993)\\nOriginal American art book publication with a new cover by Mœbius, collecting the art prints by American artists from Legends of Arzach with a few additions.\\niBOOKS Inc. was a publishing imprint of Byron Preiss, who had previously been the editor-in-chief and co-publisher of the 1989 The Art of Mœbius book by Epic. Preiss incidentally, was also the editor-in-chief for the hereafter mentioned by Mœbius illustrated 1987 Project Pendulum science fiction novel.[146]\\n\"Mœbius Arzach\" (2000)\\nIcaro (2003–2004)\\nAfter the initial cooperation with DC Comics in the mid-2000s, publisher Humanoids, Inc. (until 2013 the US subsidiary of the French publisher co-founded by Moebius in 1974) has from 2010 onward begun to reissue new editions of Mœbius works on its own, starting with two of Mœbius\\'s past collaborations with Alejandro Jodorowsky: The Incal and Madwoman of the Sacred Heart. Humanoids releases these latter-day hardcover editions, usually without dust jacket, in variant size formats, US graphic novel format (trade editions), oversized format (which is essentially the larger, standard European graphic novel A4 format), and the even larger coffee table format, the latter typically in a limited print run. Aside from the English language publications, Humanoids occasionally imports French deluxe, limited edition specialty Moebius editions, such as Le Garage hermétique (ISBN\\xa09782731652253) and Arzach (ISBN\\xa09782731634365), from the parent publisher especially on behalf of its American readership. The post-2010 Humanoids editions are also intended for, and disseminated to, the British-Canadian and UK markets, with the exception of two 2011 Incal editions, which were licensed and featured variant cover art.\\nThe Metabarons (2002)\\nGiraud had created one 8-page short story \"Au coeur de l\\'inviolable meta bunker\" in 1989,[276] focusing on one of the major secondary characters from the Incal saga, The Metabaron, whose ancestry later received its own The Metabarons spin-off series. Though that story was redrawn by the series\\' artist Juan Giménez for later book publications, Giraud\\'s original was published in black & white in the below-mentioned 1990 British publication, and subsequently included in an outing of Humanoids\\' \"Prestige Format Comic Book\" collection as \"Metabaron 1: The Lost Pages\", which introduced Valérie Beltran\\'s new coloring for Giraud\\'s Incal series.\\nThe Incal (2005–2022)\\nExcepting the early 2005 co-productions with DC Comics, all subsequent editions feature the original coloring. The two co-editions with DC featured an entirely new coloring by Valérie Beltran as well as some censorship in regard to nudity, neither of which sitting well with writer Jodorowsky, who interpreted the changes as a cheap ploy to entice a younger readership.[277] Customer reviews for both titles on Amazon.com, showed that fans were largely in concordance with Jodorowsky\\'s assessment. Considered a commercial failure, Beltran\\'s coloring has never been used again after the initial (international) releases, be it in the United States or elsewhere in the world.\\nMadwoman of the Sacred Heart (2010–2022)\\nWith the translation of volume 3 of the series, \"The Sorbonne\\'s Madman\", these anthology collections complete the series.\\n\"The Eyes of the Cat\" (2011–2013)\\n\"Angel Claws\" (2013-2019)\\nEssentially a reissue of the 1997 Eurotica title, but on this occasion issued without a dust jacket, using the plural for the title, and featuring a deviant cover.\\nFinal Incal (2014-2022)\\t\\nThough this three-volume series (originally called Après l\\'Incal – After the Incal) was ultimately realized with art from José Ladrönn, Giraud had actually already penciled the first outing in the series, \"Le nouveau rêve\",[132] but which was replaced by a re-scripted and by Ladronn redrawn variant for reprint runs. The anthology editions below however, feature the Moebius 56-page original as well as a bonus. Actually, the series was from the start intended to be a purely Jodorowsky/Moebius follow-up to their acclaimed main series, but as stated above, it was Giraud who declined to continue afterwards.\\n\"Deconstructing The Incal\" (2017)\\nAn illustrated reference book dealing with the Incal universe. Faithful reproduction of the 2016 second, updated and expanded edition of the 1989 French \"Les Mystères de l\\'Incal\" original,[252] but without the \"Au coeur de l\\'inviolable meta bunker\" short story in its original coloring, which was however published by the publisher in July 2020 as a digital release (ISBN\\xa09781643379739) under its English title \"In the Heart of the Impregnable Metabunker\" (aka \"Solune\\'s Origin\" as the story was coined by the publisher in its 2005 co-publication with DC).\\n\"Buffalo Bill, Scout and Frontiersman\" (1968)\\nEarliest known English book publication with art by Giraud, faithful reproduction of the French original.[30]\\n\"Project Pendulum\" (1987)\\nAn illustrated hardback science fiction novel with dust jacket written by Robert Silverberg and therefore a USA original. The by Mœbius illustrated book has as such seen reciprocally a translation in native French as a mass paperback release in J\\'ai lu\\xa0[fr]\\'s SF pocketbook collection (#3059, ISBN\\xa02277230596) in 1991, with a reprint in 1994.\\nThe Magic Crystal (1989–1990)\\nExecuted as softcovers in the European graphic novel format.\\n\"Eyes of the Cat\" (1990)\\nFor unknown reasons, this 54-page work had been left out of the Marvel/Epic collection of the 1980s–1990s, despite the fact that the work was hailed by comic critics as a graphic masterpiece. Still, the story did see a contemporary first-time English-language publication, with elaborate annotations from its authors, in this graphic novel anthology. The black & white Mœbius story was as only one printed on yellow paper, like it was in the original French source publication. The anthology featured the rejected Les Chiens 1979 movie poster by Mœbius as cover. In the 2010s reissued several times by Humanoides Publishing as specified above. \\nThe Mœbius Portfolio (1990)\\nBy Lofficier coined section name (1 illustrated page) for the three Moebius contributions to this British graphic novel anthology, which consisted of \"In the heart of the impregnable meta-bunker\" (8 pages, first time English language publication), \"Carnet 3: The Mœbius Sketchbook\" (8 pages), and \"Mœbius Circa \\'74\" (8 pages). Giraud provided the promotional poster art for this outing, but not the cover.\\nMœbius Collector Cards (1993)\\n\"Mœbius: a retrospective\" (1995)\\nA to 2500 copies limited exposition catalog for the similarly named exhibition at the Cartoon Art Museum, listed above.\\nMœbius Ashcan Comics (1995-1999)\\nA publication by Giraud\\'s own American publisher, and therefore not only an American original, but also a typical company release, to wit a limited, collector\\'s edition intended for sale at comic conventions only. The mini-series collected hitherto unpublished art and shorts, and were edited by the company\\'s co-shareholder J.M. Lofficier after the artist\\'s return to native France.[278]\\nMœbius Comics (1996–1997)\\nInterior art executed in black & white, the series features a reprint of The Man from the Ciguri, but also new, and previously unseen Mœbius comics and art. Noteworthy are his storyboards for the abandoned Internal Transfer movie.

Jackson began his career as a newspaper reporter in San Francisco. He later served as a principal at a high school in Truckee,[1] where he met his future wife, Lotus McGlashan.[2] They were wed December 20, 1910,[3] and the couple had two sons. Jackson then became a journalist,[4] working in Illinois, Texas, and New York.[1]\\nWhen their first son was born in 1912, the family settled in Auburn, California,[1] where Jackson became a prolific writer of western and detective stories.[5] Fifteen years later the couple moved to Pasadena, where they were divorced. Jackson then moved in with his brother Edward, who was living in Auburn. He died there June 12, 1943,[1] while working on a novel titled The Hermit of Thunder King.[2] Jackson Gregory authored more than 40 fiction novels and a number of short stories.

       "  '\\nPearl Zane Grey (January 31, 1872 – October 23, 1939) was an American author and dentist. He is known for his popular adventure novels and stories associated with the Western genre in literature and the arts; he idealized the American frontier. Riders of the Purple Sage (1912) was his best-selling book.\\nIn addition to the success of his printed works, his books have second lives and continuing influence adapted for films and television. His novels and short stories were adapted into 112 films, two television episodes, and a television series, Dick Powell\\'s Zane Grey Theatre.[1]\\nPearl Zane Grey was born January 31, 1872, in Zanesville, Ohio. His birth name may have originated from newspaper descriptions of Queen Victoria\\'s mourning clothes as \"pearl grey\".[2] He was the fourth of five children born to Alice \"Allie\" Josephine Zane, whose English Quaker immigrant ancestor Robert Zane came to the American colonies in 1673, and her husband, Lewis M. Gray, a dentist.[3] His family changed the spelling of their last name to \"Grey\" after his birth. Grey later dropped \"Pearl\" and used \"Zane\" as his first name.\\nGrey grew up in Zanesville, a city founded by his paternal grandfather Benjamin Zane\\'s brother-in-law, John McIntire (husband of Sarah Zane), who had been given the land by Grey\\'s maternal great-grandfather, Ebenezer Zane, an American Revolutionary War patriot.\\nBoth Grey and his brother Romer were active and athletic boys who were enthusiastic baseball players and fishermen.[4] From an early age, he was intrigued by history. Soon, he developed an interest in writing. His early interests contributed to his later writing success.[5] For example, his knowledge of history informed his first three novels, which recounted the heroism of ancestors who fought in the American Revolutionary War.[6]\\nAs a child, Grey frequently engaged in violent brawls, probably related to his father\\'s punishing him with severe beatings. Though irascible and antisocial like his father, Grey was supported by a loving mother and found a father substitute. Muddy Miser was an old man who approved of Grey\\'s love of fishing and writing, and who talked about the advantages of an unconventional life. Despite warnings by Grey\\'s father to steer clear of Miser, the boy spent much time during five formative years in the company of the old man.[7]\\nGrey was an avid reader of adventure stories such as Robinson Crusoe and the Leatherstocking Tales, as well as dime novels featuring Buffalo Bill and Deadwood Dick. He was enthralled by and crudely copied the great illustrators Howard Pyle and Frederic Remington.[8] He was particularly impressed with Our Western Border, a history of the Ohio frontier that likely inspired his earliest novels.[9] Grey wrote his first story, Jim of the Cave, when he was fifteen. His father tore it to shreds and beat him.[10]\\nBecause of the shame he felt as the result of a severe financial setback in 1889 due to a poor investment, Lewis Grey moved his family from Zanesville and started again in Columbus, Ohio.[11] While his father struggled to re-establish his dental practice, Grey made rural house calls and performed basic extractions, which his father had taught him. The younger Grey practiced until the state board intervened. His brother Romer earned money by driving a delivery wagon.[12] Grey also worked as a part-time usher in a theater and played summer baseball for the Columbus Capitols, with aspirations of becoming a major leaguer.[13] Eventually, Grey was spotted by a baseball scout and received offers from many colleges. Romer also attracted scouts\\' attention and went on to have a professional baseball career.[12]\\nGrey chose the University of Pennsylvania on a baseball scholarship; he studied dentistry, joined Sigma Nu fraternity, and graduated in 1896. When he arrived at Penn, he had to prove himself worthy of a scholarship before receiving it. He rose to the occasion by coming in to pitch against the Riverton club, pitching five scoreless innings and producing a double in the tenth, which contributed to the win.[14] The Ivy League was highly competitive and an excellent training ground for future pro baseball players. Grey was a solid hitter and an excellent pitcher who relied on a sharply dropping curveball. When the distance from the pitcher\\'s mound to the plate was lengthened by five feet to 60 feet 6 inches, in 1894 (primarily to reduce the dominance of Cy Young\\'s pitching), the effectiveness of Grey\\'s pitching suffered. He was re-positioned to the outfield.[15] The short, wiry baseball player remained a campus hero on the strength of his timely hitting.[16]\\nHe was an indifferent scholar, barely achieving a minimum average. Outside class, he spent his time on baseball, swimming, and creative writing, especially poetry.[16] His shy nature and his teetotaling set him apart from other students, and he socialized little. Grey struggled with the idea of becoming a writer or baseball player for his career, but unhappily concluded that dentistry was the practical choice.\\nDuring a summer break, while playing \"summer nines\" in Delphos, Ohio, Grey was charged with, and quietly settled, a paternity suit. His father paid the $133.40 cost and Grey resumed playing summer baseball. He concealed the episode when he returned to Penn.[17]\\nGrey went on to play minor league baseball with several teams, including the Newark, New Jersey Colts in 1898[18] and also with the Orange Athletic Club for several years. His brother Romer Carl \"Reddy\" Grey (known as \"R.C.\" to his family) did better and played professionally in the minor leagues. Zane Grey and Romer Grey played together as teammates for the 1895 Findlay Sluggers of the Interstate League. Romer played a single major league game in 1903 for the Pittsburgh Pirates.[19][20][21][22][23][24]\\nAfter graduating, Grey established his practice in New York City under the name of Dr. Zane Grey in 1896. It was a competitive area but he wanted to be close to publishers. He began to write in the evening to offset the tedium of his dental practice.[25] He struggled financially and emotionally. Grey was a natural writer but his early efforts were stiff and grammatically weak. Whenever possible, he played baseball with the Orange Athletic Club in New Jersey, a team of former collegiate players that was one of the best amateur teams in the country.[25]\\nGrey often went camping with his brother R.C. in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, where they fished in the upper Delaware River. When canoeing in 1900, Grey met seventeen-year-old Lina Roth, better known as \"Dolly.\" Dolly came from a family of physicians and was studying to be a schoolteacher.[26]\\nAfter a passionate and intense courtship marked by frequent quarrels, Grey and Dolly married five years later in 1905. Grey suffered bouts of depression, anger, and mood swings, which affected him most of his life. As he described it, \"A hyena lying in ambush—that is my black spell! I conquered one mood only to fall prey to the next ... I wandered about like a lost soul or a man who was conscious of imminent death.\"[27]\\nDuring his courtship of Dolly, Grey still saw previous girlfriends and warned her frankly,\\nBut I love to be free. I cannot change my spots. The ordinary man is satisfied with a moderate income, a home, wife, children, and all that. ... But I am a million miles from being that kind of man and no amount of trying will ever do any good ... I shall never lose the spirit of my interest in women.[28]After they married in 1905, Dolly gave up her teaching career. They moved to a farmhouse at the confluence of the Lackawaxen and Delaware rivers, in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, where Grey\\'s mother and sister joined them. (This house, now preserved and operated as the Zane Grey Museum, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.) Grey finally ceased his dental practice to work full-time on his nascent literary pursuits. Dolly\\'s inheritance provided an initial financial cushion.[29]\\nWhile Dolly managed Grey\\'s career and raised their three children, including son Romer Zane Grey, over the next two decades Grey often spent months away from the family. He fished, wrote, and spent time with his many mistresses. While Dolly knew of his behavior, she seemed to view it as his handicap rather than a choice. Throughout their life together, he highly valued her management of his career and their family, and her solid emotional support. In addition to her considerable editorial skills, she had good business sense and handled all his contract negotiations with publishers, agents, and movie studios. All of his income was split fifty-fifty with her; from her \"share,\" she covered all family expenses.[30] Their considerable correspondence shows evidence of his lasting love for her despite his infidelities and personal emotional turmoil.[citation needed]\\nThe Greys moved to California in 1918. In 1920 they settled in Altadena, California, at a home later known as the \\'\"Zane Grey Estate\"\\'. In Altadena Grey also spent time with his mistress Brenda Montenegro. The two met while hiking Eaton Canyon. Of her he wrote,\\nI saw her flowing raven mane against the rocks of the canyon. I have seen the red skin of the Navajo, and the olive of the Spaniards, but her ... her skin looked as if her Creator had in that instant molded her just for me. I thought it was an apparition. She seemed to be the embodiment of the West I portray in my books, open and wild.[31] Grey summed up his feelings for the city: \"In Altadena, I have found those qualities that make life worth living.\"[32]\\nWith the help of Dolly\\'s proofreading and copy editing, Grey gradually improved his writing. His first magazine article, \"A Day on the Delaware,\" a human-interest story about a Grey brothers\\' fishing expedition, was published in the May 1902 issue of Recreation magazine.[33] Elated at selling the article, Grey offered reprints to patients in his waiting room.[34] In writing, Grey found temporary escape from the harshness of his life and his demons. \"Realism is death to me. I cannot stand life as it is.\"[35] By this time, he had given up baseball.[36]\\nGrey read Owen Wister\\'s great Western novel The Virginian. After studying its style and structure in detail, he decided to write a full-length work.[37] Grey had difficulties in writing his first novel, Betty Zane (1903). When it was rejected by Harper & Brothers, he lapsed into despair.[37] The novel dramatized the heroism of an ancestor, Betty Zane who had saved Fort Henry. He self-published it, perhaps with funds provided by his wife Dolly or his brother R. C.\\'s wealthy girlfriend Reba Smith.[38] From the beginning, vivid description was the strongest aspect of his writing.[39]\\nAfter attending a lecture in New York in 1907 at the Camp-Fire Club by Charles Jesse \"Buffalo\" Jones, western hunter and guide who had co-founded Garden City, Kansas, Grey arranged for a mountain lion-hunting trip to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.[40] He brought along a camera to document his trips and prove his adventures. He also began the habit of taking copious notes, not only of scenery and activities but of dialogue.[41] His first two trips were arduous, but Grey learned much from his companions on these adventures. He gained the confidence to write convincingly about the American West, its characters, and its landscape. Treacherous river crossings, unpredictable beasts, bone-chilling cold, searing heat, parching thirst, bad water, irascible tempers, and heroic cooperation all became real to him. He wrote, \"Surely, of all the gifts that have come to me from contact with the West, this one of sheer love of wildness, beauty, color, grandeur, has been the greatest, the most significant for my work.\"[42]\\nUpon returning home in 1909, Grey wrote a new novel, The Last of the Plainsmen, describing the adventures of Buffalo Jones. Harper\\'s editor Ripley Hitchcock rejected it, the fourth work in a row. He told Grey, \"I do not see anything in this to convince me you can write either narrative or fiction.\"[43] Grey wrote dejectedly,\\nI don\\'t know which way to turn. I cannot decide what to write next. That which I desire to write does not seem to be what the editors want ... I am full of stories and zeal and fire ... yet I am inhibited by doubt, by fear that my feeling for life is false.[44]The book was later published by the American magazine, Outing, which provided Grey some satisfaction. Grey next wrote a series of magazine articles and juvenile novels.[45]\\nWith the birth of his first child pending, Grey felt compelled to complete his next novel, The Heritage of the Desert. He wrote it in four months in 1910. It quickly became a bestseller. Grey took his next work to Hitchcock again; this time Harper published his work, a historical romance in which Mormon characters were of central importance.[42] Grey continued to write popular novels about Manifest Destiny, the conquest of the Old West, and the behavior of men in elemental conditions.[citation needed]\\nTwo years later Grey produced his best-known book, Riders of the Purple Sage (1912), his all-time best-seller, and one of the most successful Western novels in history.[46] Hitchcock rejected it, but Grey took his manuscript directly to the vice president of Harper, who accepted it. The novel had a sequel (The Rainbow Trail, in 1915), and was filmed five times (in 1918, 1925, 1931, 1941, and 1996; but in later film versions the villains are corrupt judges or lawyers, not Mormon polygamists).\\nZane Grey had become a household name; thereafter, Harper eagerly received all his manuscripts. Other publishers caught on to the commercial potential of the Western novel. Max Brand and Ernest Haycox were among the most notable of other writers of Westerns.[47] Grey\\'s publishers paired his novels with some of the best illustrators of the time, including N. C. Wyeth, Frank Schoonover, Douglas Duer, W. Herbert Dunton, W. H. D. Koerner, and Charles Russell.[48]\\nGrey had the time and money to engage in his first and greatest passion: fishing. From 1918 until 1932, he was a regular contributor to Outdoor Life magazine. As one of its first celebrity writers, he began to popularize big-game fishing. Several times he went deep-sea fishing in Florida to relax and to write in solitude.[49] Although he commented that \"the sea, from which all life springs, has been equally with the desert my teacher and religion\", Grey was unable to write a great sea novel.[50] He felt the sea soothed his moods, reduced his depressions, and gained him the opportunity to harvest deeper thoughts:\\nThe lure of the sea is some strange magic that makes men love what they fear. The solitude of the desert is more intimate than that of the sea. Death on the shifting barren sands seems less insupportable to the imagination than death out on the boundless ocean, in the awful, windy emptiness. Man\\'s bones yearn for dust.[48]Over the years, Grey spent part of his time traveling and the rest of the year writing novels and articles. Unlike writers who could write every day, Grey would have dry spells and then sudden bursts of energy, in which he could write as much as 100,000 words in a month.[51] He encountered fans in most places. He visited the Rogue River in Oregon in 1919 for a fishing expedition, and fell in love with it. He returned in the 1920s, eventually setting up a cabin on the lower Rogue River. Grey captured the river\\'s essence in two books: Tales of Freshwater Fishing and Rogue River Feud.[52] Other excursions took him to Washington state and Wyoming.[53]\\n[54]\\nFrom 1923 to 1930, he spent a few weeks a year at his cabin on the Mogollon Rim, in Central Arizona. After years of abandonment and decay, the cabin was restored in 1966 by Bill Goettl, a Phoenix air conditioning magnate. He opened it to the public as a free-of-charge museum. The Dude Fire destroyed the cabin in 1990. It was later reconstructed 25 miles away in the town of Payson.[53]\\nDuring the 1930s, Grey continued to write, but the Great Depression hurt the publishing industry. His sales fell off, and he found it more difficult to sell serializations. He had avoided making investments that would have been affected by the stock market crash of 1929, and continued to earn royalty income, so he did better than many financially. Nearly half of the film adaptations of his novels were made in the 1930s.[55]\\nFrom 1925 to his death in 1939, Grey traveled more and further from his family. He became interested in exploring unspoiled lands, particularly the islands of the South Pacific, New Zealand and Australia. He thought Arizona was beginning to be overrun by tourists and speculators.[56] Near the end of his life, Grey looked into the future and wrote:\\nThe so-called civilization of man and his works shall perish from the earth, while the shifting sands, the red looming walls, the purple sage, and the towering monuments, the vast brooding range show no perceptible change.[57]The more books Grey sold, the more the established critics, such as Heywood Broun and Burton Rascoe, attacked him. They claimed his depictions of the West were too fanciful, too violent, and not faithful to the moral realities of the frontier. They thought his characters unrealistic and much larger-than-life. Broun stated that \"the substance of any two Zane Grey books could be written upon the back of a postage stamp.\"[58]\\nT. K. Whipple praised a typical Grey novel as a modern version of the ancient Beowulf saga, \"a battle of passions with one another and with the will, a struggle of love and hate, or remorse and revenge, of blood, lust, honor, friendship, anger, grief—all of a grand scale and all incalculable and mysterious.\" However, he also criticized Grey\\'s writing: \"His style, for example, has the stiffness which comes from an imperfect mastery of the medium. It lacks fluency and facility.\"[59]\\nGrey based his work in his own varied first-hand experience, supported by careful note-taking, and considerable research.[60] Despite his great popular success and fortune, Grey read the reviews and sometimes became paralyzed by negative emotions after critical ones.[61]\\nIn 1923, a reviewer said Grey\\'s \"moral ideas ... [were] decidedly askew.\" Grey reacted with a 20-page treatise, \"My Answer to the Critics.\" He defended his intentions to produce great literature in the setting of the Old West.[62] He suggested that critics should ask his readers what they think of his books, and noted actor and fan John Barrymore as an example. Dolly warned him against publishing the treatise, and he retreated from a public confrontation.[citation needed]\\nHis novel The Vanishing American (1925), first serialized in The Ladies\\' Home Journal in 1922, prompted a heated debate. People recognized its Navajo hero as patterned after Jim Thorpe, a great Native American athlete. Grey portrayed the struggle of the Navajo to preserve their identity and culture against corrupting influences of the white government and of missionaries. This viewpoint enraged religious groups. Grey contended, \"I have studied the Navaho Indians for 12 years. I know their wrongs. The missionaries sent out there are almost everyone mean, vicious, weak, immoral, useless men.\"[63] To have the book published, Grey agreed to some structural changes. With this book, Grey completed the most productive period of his writing career, having laid out most major themes, character types, and settings.[64]\\nHis Wanderer of the Wasteland is a thinly disguised autobiography.[65] One of his books, \"Tales of the Angler\\'s El Dorado, New Zealand,\" helped establish the Bay of Islands in New Zealand as a premier game fishing area. Several of his later writings (e.g., Rangle River) were based in Australia.[citation needed]\\nGrey co-founded the \"Porpoise Club\" with his friend, Robert H. Davis of Munsey\\'s Magazine, to popularize the sport of hunting of dolphins and porpoises. They made their first catch off Seabright, New Jersey, on September 21, 1912, where they harpooned and reeled in a bottlenose dolphin.[66][67]\\nGrey\\'s son Loren claims in the introduction to Tales of Tahitian Waters that Zane Grey fished on average 300 days a year through his adult life. Grey and his brother R.C. were frequent visitors to Long Key, Florida, where they helped to establish the Long Key Fishing Club, built by Henry Morrison Flagler. Zane Grey was its president from 1917 to 1920. He pioneered the fishing of Boohoo fish (sailfish). Zane Grey Creek was named for him.[68]\\nGrey indulged his interest in fishing with visits to Australia and New Zealand. He first visited New Zealand in 1926 and caught several large fish of great variety, including a mako shark, a ferocious fighter that presented a new challenge. Grey established a base at Otehei Bay, Urupukapuka Island in the Bay of Islands, which became a destination for the rich and famous. He wrote many articles in international sporting magazines highlighting the uniqueness of New Zealand fishing, which has produced heavy-tackle world records for the major billfish, striped marlin, black marlin, blue marlin and broadbill. A lodge and camp were established at Otehei Bay in 1927 called the Zane Grey Sporting Club. He held numerous world records during this time[69] and invented the teaser, a hookless bait that is still used today to attract fish. Grey made three additional fishing trips to New Zealand. The second was January to April 1927, the third December 1928 to March 1929, and the last from December 1932 to February 1933.\\nGrey fished out of Wedgeport, Nova Scotia, for many summers.\\nGrey also helped establish deep-sea sport fishing in New South Wales, Australia, particularly in Bermagui, which is famous for marlin fishing. Patron of the Bermagui Sport Fishing Association for 1936 and 1937, Grey set a number of world records,[70][71][72] and wrote of his experiences in his book An American Angler in Australia.[73][74]\\nFrom 1928 on, Grey was a frequent visitor to Tahiti. He fished the surrounding waters several months at a time and maintained a permanent fishing camp at Vairao. He claimed that these were the most difficult waters he had ever fished, but from these waters he also took some of his most important records, such as the first marlin over 1,000 pounds (450\\xa0kg).[citation needed]\\nGrey had built a getaway home in Santa Catalina Island, California, which still serves as the Zane Grey Pueblo Hotel.[75] He served as president of Catalina\\'s exclusive fishing club, the Tuna Club of Avalon.[76]\\nZane Grey died of heart failure on October 23, 1939, aged 67 at his home in Altadena, California. He was interred at the Lackawaxen and Union Cemetery, Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania.[77]\\nGrey became one of the first millionaire authors.\\nZane Grey was a major force in shaping the myths of the Old West; his books and stories were adapted into other media, such as film and TV productions. He was the author of more than 90 books, some published posthumously or based on serials originally published in magazines. His total book sales exceeded  40\\xa0million.[78]\\nGrey wrote not only Westerns, but also two hunting books, six children\\'s books, three baseball books, and eight fishing books.[79] Many of them became bestsellers. It has been estimated he wrote more than nine million words in his career.[80] \\nFrom 1917 to 1926, Grey was in the top ten best-seller list nine times, which required sales of more than 100,000 copies each time.[81] \\nEven after his death, Harper had a stockpile of his manuscripts and continued to publish a new title yearly until 1963.[82] \\nDuring the 1940s and afterward, as Grey\\'s books were reprinted as paperbacks, his sales exploded.[citation needed]\\nErle Stanley Gardner, prolific author of mystery novels and the Perry Mason series, said of Grey:\\n[He] had the knack of tying his characters into the land, and the land into the story. There were other Western writers who had fast and furious action, but Zane Grey was the one who could make the action not only convincing but inevitable, and somehow you got the impression that the bigness of the country generated a bigness of character.[83]Grey was the favorite writer of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.[84]\\nA 1950 newspaper article stated that Romer Zane Grey and his mother had completed work on Cahuenga Pass, one of Zane Grey\\'s unfinished novels, and that a film treatment would be prepared.[85] In 1953 columnist Hedda Hopper reported that a proposed film project, Thirty Thousand on the Hoof, was based on one of the six unfinished Grey novels that had been completed by his wife.[86]\\nGrey started his association with Hollywood when William Fox bought the rights to Riders of the Purple Sage for $2,500 in 1916.[87] The ascending arc of Grey\\'s career matched that of the motion picture industry. It eagerly adapted Western stories to the screen practically from its inception, with Bronco Billy Anderson becoming the first major western star.[88] Legendary director John Ford was then a young stage hand and Tom Mix, who had been a real cowhand, was defining the persona of the film cowboy.[89] The Grey family moved to California to be closer to the film industry and to enable Grey to fish in the Pacific.[citation needed]\\nAfter his first two books were adapted to the screen, Grey formed his own motion picture company. This enabled him to control production values and faithfulness to his books. After seven films he sold his company to Jesse Lasky who was a partner of the founder of Paramount Pictures. Paramount made a number of movies based on Grey\\'s writings and hired him as advisor.[90] Many of his films were shot at locations described in his books.[citation needed]\\nIn 1936 Grey appeared as himself in a feature film shot in Australia, White Death (1936). At the same time he provided a story that was filmed as Rangle River (1936).\\nGrey became disenchanted by the commercial exploitation and copyright infringement of his works. He felt his stories and characters were diluted by being adapted to film.[91] Nearly 50 of his novels were converted into more than 100 Western movies.[92] Shortly after Grey\\'s death, the success of Fritz Lang\\'s Western Union (1941), a film based on one of his books, helped bring about a resurgence in Hollywood westerns. Its costars were Randolph Scott and Robert Young. The period of the 1940s and 1950s included the great works of John Ford, who successfully used the settings of Grey\\'s novels in Arizona and Utah.[93]\\nThe success of Grey\\'s The Lone Star Ranger (the novel was adapted into four movies: 1914, 1919, 1930 and 1942, and a comic book in 1949) and King of the Royal Mounted (popular as a series of Big Little Books and comics, later turned into a 1936 film and three film serials) inspired two radio series by George Trendle (WXYZ, Detroit). Later these were adapted again for television, forming the series The Lone Ranger and Challenge of the Yukon (Sgt. Preston of the Yukon on TV). More of Grey\\'s work was featured in adapted form on The Zane Grey Show, which ran on the Mutual Broadcasting System for five months in the 1940s, and the \"Zane Grey Western Theatre,\" which had a five-year run of 145 episodes.[92]\\nMany famous actors got their start in films based on Zane Grey books. They included Gary Cooper, Randolph Scott, William Powell, Wallace Beery, Richard Arlen, Buster Crabbe, Shirley Temple, and Fay Wray. Victor Fleming, later director of Gone with the Wind, and Henry Hathaway, who later directed True Grit, both learned their craft on Grey films.[citation needed]\\nWorks published posthumously after 1939 include original novels, sequels to earlier novels, and compilations and revisions of previously published novels. All western works were translated from English into Spanish by Editorial Juventud in 1959 for the CLASICOS Y MODERNOS collection.\\nBetween 1911 and 1996, 112 films were adapted from Grey\\'s novels and stories. In addition, three television series included episodes adapted from his work, including Dick Powell\\'s Zane Grey Theatre (1956–58).[1]\\nSources\\nArchival materials\\nOther\\n',\n",

       "  \"Jesse Edward Grinstead (October 16, 1866 – March 8, 1948) was an American publisher, editor, poet and politician who in later life became a popular writer of Western fiction. Over his writing career Grinstead penned some 30 novels along with scores of short stories and articles that appeared in magazines and newspapers. At least two of his stories, The Scourge of the Little C (as Tumbling River) and Sunset of Power, became Hollywood films. Volumes of Grinstead's works were also published in Britain, Sweden and Spain.[1][2]\\nJ. E. Grinstead was born at Owensboro, Kentucky, the son of William Travis Grinstead and Elizabeth Miranda Priest.[1][2] According to his brother, author Hugh Fox Grinstead, as a young man their father had served as a guard under Lt. John James Abert during a U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers survey of the American Southwest, had made nine crossings of the Great Plains as a wagon-master on trips to New Mexico and California, prospected for gold in the Sacramento Valley, trekked on foot from San Juan del Sur to Lake Nicaragua, transported supplies during the Utah War to General Albert S. Johnston's headquarters at Salt Lake City and conveyed the first threshing machine to Fort Bridger, Wyoming Territory.[3] By 1860 Grinstead's parents were married and living on a farm in or near Long Prairie in Mississippi County, Missouri. After the outbreak of the American Civil War Grinstead's family returned to Owensboro for the duration of the war.[1][2][4]\\nBy 1868 Grinstead's family had returned to Missouri to a farm in Pettis County, not far from where his grandfather, Jesse Grinstead, had farmed since before the 1840s. In 1884 the family left Missouri to settle in Indian Territory near the town of Oakland where William Grinstead would serve as their first postmaster. A few years later, when Grinstead's family relocated to Whitesboro, Texas, he chose to remain behind. He supported himself by working a variety of odd jobs before finding full-time employment as a printer with The Ardmore Weekly Courier. In 1893 Grinstead founded The Oakland ‘Indian Territory’ News, the town's first paper. Six years later he moved to Kerrville, Texas in the vain hope that the climate there would help alleviate his wife's lung ailment.[5]\\nWithin a year or so he purchased The Kerrville News and, inspired by the area's surrounding beauty, renamed it The Kerrville Mountain Sun.[6] In 1903 he was elected mayor of Kerrville and in 1906 their representative (House District 99) in the 30th state legislature. While serving in the Texas House of Representatives he was instrumental in pushing through legislation that led to the creation of the State Tubercular Sanatorium in Carlsbad. In July 1908 Grinstead failed to win Democratic support for a second term and was replaced by Sam O’Bryant who prevailed against his Republican opponent that November.[7][8] Grinstead also served on the Kerrville school board for many years.[2]\\nGrinstead sold his interest in the Mountain Sun in 1917 to Terrell Publishing to devote his time to writing and other interests. He became a frequent contributor of Western fiction, sometimes under the pseudonyms, Tex Janis, William Crump Rush or George Bowles, to such pulp publications as Big-Book Western Magazine, Thrilling Ranch Stories, Western Romances, Argosy Magazine and Frontier Magazine. Grinstead published some 30 novels over his career along with numerous short stories and articles. Beginning in January 1921 through December 1925 Grinstead wrote and published Grinstead's Graphic, a monthly magazine of poetry and local interest stories tasked with promoting the Hill Country[9] during a period of hard times.[5]\\nThe 1927 silent film Tumbling River starring Tom Mix was based on his novel, The Scourge of the Little C, and his story, Sunset of Power, was adapted for film in 1936 with Buck Jones in the lead role.\\nIn December 1899 Grinstead's first wife, Sarah Frances, died at the age of 27 at Kerrville. The couple had three boys, Edward Everett (1892–1893), Grady Hugh (1894–1974) and Eugene Doyle (1897–1951). In 1900 he married Gertrude Wright (1868–1946), a widow who operated a boarding house in Kerrville. Three children, Jesse H. (1901–1942), Bessie G. (1903–1958), and Pam (1905–1974), soon followed.[5][10][11] By the time of her death in 1940, Grinstead's mother had been considered, at 107, the oldest living person in Missouri.[12]\\nJesse Grinstead died at the age of 81 on March 8, 1948, at Kerrville and was interred at Oakwood Cemetery, Whitesboro. At the time Grinstead had reportedly left behind some 100 unpublished works, three of which he had recently submitted for publication.[2]\\n Media related to Jesse Edward Grinstead at Wikimedia Commons\\n\",\n",
       "  'Fred Grove (born Frederick Herridge; July 4, 1913 – September 2008)[1] was a Native American author and winner of five prestigious \"Spur Awards\" from Western Writers of America for his western novels. He was born in Hominy, Oklahoma.\\nGrove was the son of a Kansas cowboy and an Osage-Lakota woman born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. His great-grandfather, Henry Chatillon, guided Francis Parkman on his tour of the Great Plains, from which evolved the classic book, The Oregon Trail. Grove was provoked into writing at an early age. The ten-year-old boy was visiting relatives in Fairfax, Oklahoma, when a wealthy Indian woman\\'s house exploded, killing her and two family members. The novelist graphically recalled details the 1923 murder conspiracy to appropriate the woman\\'s money. Grove\\'s mother was Osage and Lakota, which thrust the tragedy into sharper focus. He remembers \"the situation was lawless, with county officials apparently doing little to bring the guilty to justice.\" A subsequent FBI investigation resulted in prison sentences for two white men, one a cattleman and leading citizen of Fairfax — the other the son-in-law of the murdered woman.\\nHe remembered, \"Those were years of fear in Osage County,\" he said, \"of rumors and threats. As a boy this intrigued me, angered me. I wanted to write about it someday, and air those wrongs.\"[citation needed] A number of years later, Grove met the FBI agent who directed the investigation, and they collaborated on a non-fiction book about the incident, but were unable to find a publisher. \"It was very discouraging. I spent a year reading state newspapers on microfilm.\" The result of his extensive research were two novels, Warrior Road and Drum Without Warriors. The first novel was written from a Native American\\'s point of view, the second from an FBI agent posing as a racehorse owner looking for match races, which sparked Grove\\'s latent interest in quarterhorse racing. He also penned Apache novels, which he has continued to write into his 90s.\\nDetermined to write, Grove earned his B.A. degree in journalism from the University of Oklahoma, class of 1937, where he was a sports editor of the student daily newspaper during his senior year. He later served as sports editor for two dailies before drifting into general news and desk work. \"It was during the Depression and you felt lucky to have a job,\" he said. \"My first one paid $18 a week and I was glad to have it.\" Grove had attempted to write westerns after World War II, and interviewed \"a lot of Oklahoma pioneers\" while working as a reporter for the Shawnee Morning News. \"They were wonderful old people who had made the land runs in that state and remembered the 1870s and 80s. This further spurred my interest in the West.\"\\nHe sold his first short story, \"The Hangman Ghost\" to .44 Western Magazine in 1951, and taught beginning reporting at the University of Oklahoma as well as a public relations course. There he took creative writing classes from Foster Harris and Walter Campbell (aka Stanley Vestal). He later served as public information director of the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority \"until the politicians got hold of OETA, demanding that the staff perform like trained seals.\"\\nGrove quit his job and considered it the best career move he ever made. He then wrote his Osage novels and got into quarter horse racing. Flame of the Osage, his first novel, was sold when he was 45 and he said, his writing was more habit than compulsion. \"I enjoy writing when I have a feel for the story. Writing hard takes a lot out of you. The finished novel is the real reward for me, a feeling of great relief.\"\\nQuarter horse racing became the subject of three of Grove\\'s most successful books: The Great Horse Race,  Bush Track, and Match Race. The first and last of these won awards.\\nNotable among Grove\\'s later fiction is the series of five Jesse Wilder novels set during and after the American Civil War: Bitter Trumpet, Trail of Rogues, Man on a Red Horse, Into the Far Mountains, and A Soldier Returns.\\n(Source: Maverick Writers (ISBN\\xa00-87004-331-5) by S.

       "  'Frank Gruber (born February 2, 1904, Elmer, Minnesota, died December 9, 1969, Santa Monica, California) was an American writer of short stories, novels, and screenplays. Included in his work are stories for pulp fiction magazines, dozens of and novels (mostly Westerns and detective yarns) and scripts for Hollywood movies and television shows. He sometimes wrote under the pen names Stephen Acre, Charles K. Boston and John K. Vedder, and also was the creator of three TV series.\\nGruber said that as a nine-year-old newsboy, he read his first book, Luke Walton, the Chicago Newsboy by Horatio Alger. During the next seven years he read a hundred more Alger books and said they influenced him professionally more than anything else in his life. They told how poor boys became rich, but what they instilled in Gruber was an ambition, at age nine or ten, to be an author. He had written his first book before age 11, using a pencil on wrapping paper.\\nAge 13 or 14, his ambition died for a while but several years later it rose again and he started submitting stories to various magazines, like Smart Set and Atlantic Monthly. Getting rejected, he lowered his sights to The Saturday Evening Post and Colliers, with no more success. The pulps were getting noticed and Gruber tried those but with no success. As a story came back with a rejection slip, he would post it off again to someone else, so he could have as many as 40 stories going back and forth at different times, costing him about a third of his earnings in postage. Erle Stanley Gardner called him the fighter who licked his weight in rejection slips.\\nGruber served in the US Army from 1920-1921.[1] Gruber said that, while in the Army, he learned how to manipulate the dice to throw 35 consecutive sevens, but that he had \"lost this skill through lack of practice\".[2]\\nFebruary 1927, he finally sold a story. It was bought by The United Brethren Publishing House of Dayton. It was called \"The Two Dollar Raise\" and he got a cheque through for three dollars and fifty cents.\\nAnswering an ad in The Chicago Tribune, he got a job editing a small farm paper. In September he got a better paid job in Iowa and soon found himself editing five farm papers. He had much money and even wrote some articles for the papers but found he had no time to write the stories he wanted to write.\\nIn 1932 the Depression hit, and he lost his job. 1932 to 1934 were his bad years. He wrote and wrote, many stories typed out on an old \"Remington\" but of the Sunday School stories, the spicy sex stories, the detective stories, the sports stories, the love stories, very few sold, with some companies paying him as little as a quarter of a cent per word. He had a few successes and remained in Mt. Morris, Illinois for 14 months before deciding to head to New York on July 1, 1934.\\nThere were numerous publishing houses in New York and he could save money on postage but this led to him walking miles to deliver manuscripts as he had so little money, not even enough for food most of the time. He stayed in a room in the Forty Fourth Street Hotel ($10.50 per week).\\nIn his book, The Pulp Jungle (1967), Gruber details the struggles (for a long time, at least once a day he had tomato soup, which was free hot water in a bowl, with free crackers crumbled in and half a bottle of tomato sauce added) he had for a few years and numerous fellow authors he became friendly with, many of whom were famous or later became famous.\\nEarly December 1934 and with endless rejection slips, he got a phone call from Rogers Terrill. Could he do a 5,500 word filler story for Operator #5 pulp magazine by next day? He did and got paid. Even better, they wanted another one next month, and another. He was then asked to do a filler for Ace Sports pulp, which sold. Gruber\\'s income from writing in 1934 was under $400. In 1935, his stories were suddenly wanted and he earned $10,000 that year. His wife came to live with him (she had been living with relatives) and he lived the good life, moving into a big apartment and buying a Buick ($750).\\nJanuary 1942, Gruber decided to try Hollywood, having heard about the huge sums some stories sold for and stayed there till 1946.\\nGruber—who stated that only seven types of Westerns existed[3]—wrote more than 300 stories for over 40 pulp magazines, as well as more than 60 novels, which had sold more than 90 million copies in 24 countries, sixty five screenplays, and a hundred television scripts.  25 of his books have sold to motion pictures, and he created three TV series: Tales of Wells Fargo, The Texan and Shotgun Slade. His first novel, The Peace Marshall, which was rejected by every agent in New York at the time, became a film called The Kansan, starring Richard Dix. The book has been reprinted many times with total sales of over one million copies.\\nHe bragged that he could write a complete mystery novel in 16 days and then use the other 14 days of the month to knock out a historical serial for a magazine.[4] His mystery novels included The French Key (for which he sold the motion picture rights for $14,000 in 1945) and The Laughing Fox.\\nHe was a social drinker in the thirties (regular parties for authors were alcohol only with no food provided), being too busy to become a hard drinker, but later just about gave up alcohol.\\n',\n",

After visiting many specialists he was diagnosed with \"infantile paralysis\" though his condition is now known to be cerebral palsy. With the help of a toy railway engine made by his father, Hague learned to walk when he was three and half years old. At nine years of age, Hague went to Canada with his parents, where he received treatment at the Toronto\\'s Hospital for Sick Children. The treatment was not successful, and the family returned to England after two and half years. Unable to settle, they returned to Canada, where they lived for about six years.[2]\\nIn his teens, while at school in Oakville, Ontario, Hague took part in and won a mock election to \"replace\" the local mayor. It was at this time he discovered an ability to entertain people. Another achievement while in Canada was when Hague\\'s father taught him to drive.\\nOn his return to England at the age of 18, Hague soon started singing with various bands. At this stage it was mostly rock and roll with some country and western. He decided that the latter was his main interest. In 1964 he formed his own country trio called The Westernaires. In 1966, Hague turned professional and made his first recording, called \"Mule Train\", and married Ivy.

       "  'William Wister Haines (September 17, 1908 – November 18, 1989) was an American author, screenwriter, and playwright.[1] His most notable work, Command Decision, was published as a novel, play, and screenplay following World War II.\\nHaines was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1908, one of three sons of Diedrich Jansen Haines and Ella Wister Haines. His father, the grandson of Reuben Haines III, worked as vice president of a surety bond company, Southern Surety Company of Iowa, and his mother was a notable author of mysteries and serialized stories, many of which appeared in The Des Moines Register. His uncle, Owen Wister, authored the 1902 novel The Virginian, which popularized the genre of Western fiction, and later became both a successful film and television series.\\nHaines was educated at the Scholta-Nollen School, the Culver Military Academy, and Des Moines\\' Theodore Roosevelt High School, from which he graduated in 1926. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1931 with a degree in engineering. Unable to find employment as an engineer during the Great Depression, he worked nights as an electric lineman on a railroad running between Chicago and the Eastern Seaboard.  His experience as a lineman became the basis for his first two books, Slim and High Tension.\\nHaines joined the United States Army Air Forces in early 1942, going to the United Kingdom as an intelligence officer with the U.S. Eighth Air Force. Haines served nearly three years in Britain, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel on the staff of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces Europe, where he worked on the Ultra Project.\\nIn 1934, Haines married Frances Tuckerman and had two children, William Jr. and Laura. Haines retired in Laguna Niguel, in Southern California.\\nHaines died on November 18, 1989, of a stroke while on a cruise ship near Acapulco. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.[2][3]\\nSlim, published in 1934, won him critical and popular acclaim as a writer.  The novel was part adventure tale, part social commentary, and part-time capsule of the Great Depression, notable for its realism and its on-target portrayal of working class attitudes and language during that period.  Slim continues to have an audience today and is a sought-after book, especially among utility linemen and railfans.  In 1937, the novel was made into the movie Slim starring Henry Fonda, with Haines writing the screenplay.  The illustrations for the hardcover of Slim were by Robert Lawson and do not appear in the paperback releases.\\nHis next novel, High Tension (1938), was a critical success but less successful financially. His novel The Winter War (1961), about the 1877 winter campaign of the U.S. Army against the Sioux in Montana, was at the time of its publication a popular western and was awarded the Spur Award of the Western Writers of America. He also published a non-fiction book, Ultra in 1980, also based on his World War II experiences as an intelligence officer. His other books were The Honorable Rocky Slade (1955), Target (1964), and The Image (1968).\\nHis filmography credits are Alibi Ike (1935), Man of Iron (1935), Black Legion (1937), Slim (1937), Mr. Dodd Takes the Air (1937), Submarine D-1 (1937), The Texans (1938), Beyond Glory (1948), Command Decision (1948), The Racket (1951), One Minute to Zero (1952), The Eternal Sea (1955), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and Torpedo Run (1958).\\nHaines was a member of the Authors Guild and the Dramatists Guild of America. He also contributed various articles and stories to magazines. His short story \"Remarks-None\" was published in the railroad story anthology Headlights and Markers in 1968.\\nWhile in Europe, Haines began writing a stage play, Command Decision, based on his 8th Air Force experiences, but was unable to sell it. Many producers rejected it, feeling it followed too closely the war\\'s end to have popular appeal. A publisher suggested he write it as a novel, which first appeared as a four-part serial in The Atlantic Monthly between October 1946 and 1947. In January 1947, the first edition of Command Decision brought Haines critical and popular acclaim.  The success of the novel revived the play, which ran for 409 performances on Broadway between October 1947 and September 1948.\\nIn May 1947 Haines reached a deal with MGM Studios to sell it the film rights for $100,000, with an additional promise of 15% of the play\\'s weekly gross (or approximately $300,000) if the play opened by October 1947.[4]\\nCommand Decision as a feature film starring Clark Gable premiered in December 1948.  The film and book have been called the first important work of fiction about World War II.  They differ from most of the prior war-themed works from that period, which stressed the experiences of average citizens forced to go to war, in that Command Decision explores the pressures of leadership, political in-fighting, moral conflicts, and psychological effects rather than glamorizing combat, and frankly admitting the high losses in men and materiel that characterized air combat. It also takes a \"warts and all\" approach to the conduct of some U.S. military leaders, depicting occasional propaganda misrepresentations, personal ambitions, opportunism, and information clampdowns in the name of security. The protagonist of the story is a general who must choose between submitting to public relations demands and doing what must be done to defeat Germany.

He was born in San Diego, California, graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and served in the Marines during World War II.[3] Some of his mysteries were published under the pen names \"O.M. Hall\" and \"Jason Manor.\"[3] Hall received his Master of Fine Arts in English from the Iowa Writers\\' Workshop at the University of Iowa.[4]\\nHis books focus primarily on the historical American West. His most famous book, Warlock, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1958.[1] The film adaptation of the same title, directed by Edward Dmytryk, starred Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark and Anthony Quinn.  In Thomas Pynchon\\'s introduction to Richard Fariña\\'s Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me, Pynchon stated that he and Fariña started a \"micro-cult\" around Warlock. Another novel, The Downhill Racers, was made into a film  starring Robert Redford in 1969.[5]\\nAfter the death of Wallace Stegner, Hall was considered the dean of West Coast writers, having supported the early careers of novelists such as Richard Ford and  Michael Chabon, both graduates of the well-known writing program at the University of California, Irvine, where Hall taught for many years, and Amy Tan, his student from The Community of Writers at Squaw Valley.[2]  Hall\\'s colleagues at Irvine included Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and fellow Iowa graduate Charles Wright, and poet and Victorian Scholar Robert Peters.

He later earned an M.A. in Spirituality from Santa Clara University.\\nHansen is the Gerard Manley Hopkins, S.J. Professor in the Arts and Humanities  at Santa Clara University, where he teaches courses in writing and literature.[3] He is married to the writer Bo Caldwell.\\nIn January 2007, Hansen was ordained as a permanent deacon in the Roman Catholic Church.[4]\\nIn May 2009, Hansen was inducted to the college of fellows at Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology.\\nHansen has received fellowships from the Michigan Society of Fellows, the National Endowment for the Arts, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, and the Lyndhurst Foundation, as well as an Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.[5]\\nHansen frequently writes novels about the Old West, mixing history with morality and drama. Hansen's first novel, Desperadoes (1979), reimagines the story of the Dalton Gang. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, a 1983 novel chronicling the life and death of the iconic outlaw, was Hansen's most popular work.[6] It also brought him wide critical acclaim, and was nominated to the short list for the PEN/Faulkner Award.[7] The novel was adapted into the 2007 film of the same name, for which Hansen was an advisor for the dialogue and an actor in a cameo role as a frontier reporter.[8]\\nCatholic themes of love, redemption and resurrection recur in Hansen's novels and stories. Mariette in Ecstasy (1991), his novel of the faith and religious experience in the context of a cloistered Catholic nun who apparently bears the stigmata, earned him near universal critical praise. He won the fiction prize from the Bay Area Reviewers Association and the Gold Medal for Excellence in Fiction from the Commonwealth Club of California. Hansen's novel, Exiles (2008), tells in parallel the story of the shipwreck of the SS Deutschland, which cost the lives of five young nuns, and the story of poet Gerard Manley Hopkins who was inspired by the tragedy to write The Wreck of the Deutschland.\\nHansen's 1996 novel, Atticus, about the bond of love between a father and a son who has died under mysterious circumstances in a dusty Mexican town, was a finalist for both the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award.[9][10] Hitler's Niece (1999) is a historical novel that offers a view of Hitler as seen through the eyes of Geli Raubal, the daughter of his half-sister.

       "  '\\nBret Harte (/hɑːrt/ HART, born Francis Brett Hart, August 25, 1836 – May 5, 1902) was an American short story writer and poet best remembered for short fiction featuring miners, gamblers, and other romantic figures of the California Gold Rush. In a career spanning more than four decades, he also wrote poetry, plays, lectures, book reviews, editorials, and magazine sketches.\\nHarte moved from California to the eastern U.S. and later to Europe. He incorporated new subjects and characters into his stories, but his Gold Rush tales have been those most often reprinted, adapted, and admired.[2]\\nHarte was born in 1836[3] in New York\\'s capital city of Albany.[4] He was named after his great-grandfather, Francis Brett. When he was young, his father, Henry, changed the spelling of the family name from Hart to Harte. Henry\\'s father was Bernard Hart, an Orthodox Jewish immigrant who flourished as a merchant, becoming one of the founders of the New York Stock Exchange.[5]  Bret\\'s mother, Elizabeth Rebecca Ostrander Hart, was from the English and Dutch culture and raised her child in a Dutch Reformed church.[6] Later, Francis preferred to be known by his middle name, but he spelled it with only one \"t\", becoming Bret Harte.[7] Harte was of French Huguenot and Dutch ancestry and descended from prominent New York landowner Francis Rombouts.[8]\\nAn avid reader as a boy, Harte published his first work at age 11, a satirical poem titled \"Autumn Musings\", now lost. Rather than attracting praise, the poem garnered ridicule from his family. As an adult, he recalled to a friend,[who?] \"Such a shock was their ridicule to me that I wonder that I ever wrote another line of verse.\"[9]\\nHarte\\'s formal schooling[where?] ended when he was 13, in 1849.[10]\\nHarte moved to California in 1853, later working there in a number of capacities, including miner, teacher, messenger, and journalist; he was also secretary of the San Francisco Mint.[11] He spent part of his life in the northern California coastal town of Union (now Arcata), a settlement on Humboldt Bay, as a tutor and school teacher, then a  printer\\'s devil on The Northern Californian,[12] and went on to reporting news, writing poems, and occasionally, acting editor, leaving after three years, from lynching threats for writing  an editorial about the 26 February 1860 Wiyot massacre.[13]\\nUnion was established as a provisioning center for mining camps in the interior.[citation needed]\\nThe Wells Fargo Messenger of July 1916 relates that after an unsuccessful attempt to make a living in the gold camps, Harte signed on as a messenger with Wells Fargo & Co. Express. He guarded treasure boxes on stagecoaches for a few months, then gave it up to become the schoolmaster at a school near the town of Sonora, in the Sierra foothills. He created his character Yuba Bill from his memory of an old stagecoach driver.\\nAmong Harte\\'s first literary efforts was a poem published in The Golden Era in 1857[14] and, in October of that same year, his first prose piece on \"A Trip Up the Coast\".[15] In the spring of 1860 he was hired as editor of The Golden Era, which he attempted to make into a more literary publication.[16] Mark Twain later recalled that, as an editor, Harte struck \"a new and fresh and spirited note\" which \"rose above that orchestra\\'s mumbling confusion and was recognizable as music\".[17]\\nThe 1860 massacre of between 80 and 200 Wiyot Indians at the village of Tuluwat (near Eureka in Humboldt County, California) was reported by Harte in San Francisco and New York. While serving as assistant editor of the Northern Californian,[18] Harte was left in charge of the paper during the temporary absence of his boss, Stephen G. Whipple. Harte published a detailed account condemning the slayings, writing: \\n\\n[A] more shocking and revolting spectacle was never exhibited to the eyes of a Christian and civilized people. Old women, wrinkled and decrepit, lay weltering in blood, their brains dashed out and dabbled with their long gray hair. Infants scarce a span long, with their faces cloven with hatchets and their bodies ghastly with wounds.[16]After he published the editorial, Harte\\'s life was threatened, and he was forced to flee one month later. Harte quit his job and moved to San Francisco, where an anonymous letter published in a city paper describing widespread community approval of the massacre was attributed to him. In addition, no one was ever brought to trial, despite the evidence of a planned attack and of references to specific individuals, including a rancher named Larabee and other members of the unofficial militia called the Humboldt Volunteers.[19]\\nHarte married Anna Griswold on August 11, 1862, in San Rafael, California.[21] From the start, the marriage was rocky. Some suggested that she was consumed by extreme jealousy, while early Harte biographer Henry C. Merwin privately concluded that she was \"almost impossible to live with\".[10]\\nThe well-known minister Thomas Starr King recommended Harte to James T. Fields, editor of the prestigious magazine The Atlantic Monthly, which published Harte\\'s first short story in October 1863.[22] In  1864, Harte joined with Charles Henry Webb in starting a new literary journal called The Californian. He became friends with and mentored poet Ina Coolbrith.[16]\\nIn 1865, Harte was asked by bookseller Anton Roman to edit a book of California poetry; it was to be a showcase of the finest California writers.[16] When the book, called Outcroppings, was published, it contained only 19 poets, many of them Harte\\'s friends (including Ina Coolbrith and Charles Warren Stoddard). The book caused some controversy, as Harte used the preface as a vehicle to attack California\\'s literature, blaming the state\\'s \"monotonous climate\" for its bad poetry.[16] While the book was widely praised in the East, many newspapers and poets in the West took umbrage at his remarks.[16]\\nIn 1868, Harte became editor of The Overland Monthly, another new literary magazine, published by Roman Anton with the intention of highlighting local writings.[23] The Overland Monthly was more in tune with the pioneering spirit of excitement in California. Harte\\'s short story \"The Luck of Roaring Camp\" appeared in the magazine\\'s second issue, propelling him to fame nationwide and in Europe.[18][11]\\nWhen word of Charles Dickens\\'s death reached Harte in July 1870, he immediately sent a dispatch across the bay to San Francisco to hold back the forthcoming issue of the Overland Monthly for 24 hours so that he could compose the poetic tribute \"Dickens in Camp\".\\nHarte\\'s fame increased with the publication of his satirical poem \"Plain Language from Truthful James\" in the September 1870 issue of the Overland Monthly.[24] The poem became better known by its alternate title \"The Heathen Chinee\" after being republished in a Boston newspaper in 1871.[25] It was also quickly republished in a number of other newspapers and journals, including the New York Evening Post, the New York Tribune, the Boston Evening Transcript, the Providence Journal, the Hartford Courant, Prairie Farmer, and the Saturday Evening Post.[26] The poem was a fictional representation of attacks on Chinese immigrants and Harte intended to the reader to sympathize with the victim, the character Ah Sin.[27]:\\u200a23–24\\u200a Instead, readers identified with the attacker, the character William Nye.[27]:\\u200a24\\u200a Harte later referred to the piece as \"the worst poem I ever wrote, possibly the worst poem anyone ever wrote.\"[27]:\\u200a24\\u200a\\nLike Plain Language from Truthful James, Harte\\'s 1874 short story Wan Lee, the Pagan also sought to undermine stereotypes about Chinese immigrants and to portray white Americans as the true savages.[27]:\\u200a24\\u200a\\nHarte was determined to pursue his literary career and traveled back east with his family in 1871 to New York and eventually to Boston, where he contracted with the publisher of The Atlantic Monthly for an annual salary of $10,000, \"an unprecedented sum at the time\".[28] His popularity waned and, by the end of 1872, he was without a publishing contract and increasingly desperate. He spent the next few years struggling to publish new work or republish old and delivering lectures about the gold rush. The winter of 1877–78 was particularly hard for him and his family. He recalled it as a \"hand-to-mouth life\" and wrote to his wife Anna, \"I don\\'t know—looking back—what ever kept me from going down, in every way, during that awful December and January\".[29]\\nSome time between 1872 and 1881, Harte rented the Willows, a Morristown, New Jersey mansion then owned by Union general and author Joseph Warren Revere.[30] Harte\\'s time in Morristown inspired him to write an 1877 historical romance novel, Thankful Blossom.[31]\\nAfter months of soliciting for such a role, Harte accepted the position of United States Consul in the town of Krefeld, Germany, in May 1878. Mark Twain had been a friend and supporter of Harte\\'s until a substantial falling out, and he had previously tried to block any appointment for Harte. In a letter to William Dean Howells, he complained that Harte would be an embarrassment to the United States because, as he wrote, \"Harte is a liar, a thief, a swindler, a snob, a sot, a sponge, a coward, a Jeremy Diddler, he is brim full of treachery... To send this nasty creature to puke upon the American name in a foreign land is too much\".[32] Eventually, Harte was given a similar role in Glasgow in 1880. In 1885 he settled in London.[11] Throughout his time in Europe, he regularly wrote to his wife and children and sent monthly financial contributions. He declined to invite them to join him, nor did he return to the United States to visit them. His excuses were usually related to money. During the 24 years that he spent in Europe, he never abandoned writing and maintained a prodigious output of stories that retained the freshness of his earlier work. Among his writings of this time were parodies and satires of other writers, including \"The Stolen Cigar-Case\" featuring ace detective \"Hemlock Jones\", which Ellery Queen praised as \"probably the best parody of Sherlock Holmes ever written\".[33]\\nHe died in Camberley, England, in 1902 of throat cancer and is buried at Frimley.[34] His wife Anna (née Griswold) Harte died on August 2, 1920. The couple lived together only 16 of the 40 years that they were married.[35]\\n\\nIn 1878, Andrew Carnegie praised Harte in Round the World as uniquely American, likely alluding to his regionalism:\"A whispering pine of the Sierras transplanted to Fifth Avenue! How could it grow? Although it shows some faint signs of life, how sickly are the leaves! As for fruit, there is none. America had in Bret Harte its most distinctively national poet.\"[36]Rudyard Kipling also showed himself to be an admirer of Harte\\'s writing.  In From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel,[37] while in San Francisco Kipling wrote:\"A reporter asked me what I thought of the city, and I made answer suavely that it was hallowed ground to me because of Bret Harte. That was true: \\'Well,\\' said the reporter, \\'Bret Harte claims California, but California don\\'t claim Bret Harte.\\xa0...\\' He could not understand that to the outside world the city was worth a great deal less than the man.\"Mark Twain characterized him and his writing as insincere. Writing in his autobiography four years after Harte\\'s death, Twain criticized the miners\\' dialect used by Harte, claiming that it never existed outside of his imagination. Additionally, Twain accused Harte of \"borrowing\" money from his friends with no intention of repaying it and of financially abandoning his wife and children. He referred repeatedly to Harte as \"The Immortal Bilk\".[38]\\nHarte\\'s short story collections Condensed Novels (1867) and Condensed Novels: Second Series New Burlesques (1902) are parodies of contemporaneous writers and novels.  \\n The Outcasts of Poker Flat\\n',\n",

F. G. Thatcher.[2] In 1925, Haycox married Jill M. Chord, and they had two children.[2]\\nHe published two dozen novels and about 300 short stories, many of which appeared first in pulp magazines in the early 1920s. During the 1930s and 1940s, he was a regular contributor to Collier\\'s Weekly from 1931 and The Saturday Evening Post from 1943. Fans of his work included Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway, and the latter once wrote, \"I read The Saturday Evening Post whenever it has a serial by Ernest Haycox.\"[4]\\nHis story \"Stage to Lordsburg\" (1937) was made into the movie Stagecoach (1939), directed by John Ford and featuring John Wayne in the role that made him a star. The novel Trouble Shooter (1936), originally serialized in Collier\\'s, was the basis for the movie Union Pacific (1939), directed by Cecil B. DeMille, starring Barbara Stanwyck and Joel McCrea. Haycox wrote the screenplay for Montana (1950), directed by Ray Enright, which stars Alexis Smith and Errol Flynn.\\nHaycox died after unsuccessful cancer surgery in 1950, twelve days after his 51st birthday, in Portland.[1] In 2005, the Western Writers of America voted Haycox one of the 24 best Western authors of the Twentieth Century.\\nWhile living in New York Haycox wrote his first series of interconnected stories set in Burnt Creek, a town in central Oregon.[5]\\nFrom 1924 through 1926, Haycox lived in New York City, and he became deeply interested in the American Revolution. Haycox made several trips to battlefields in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Massachusetts and wrote eight stories and two novelettes set during that era. After publishing one of these stories, Haycox received a letter from a reader stating that Haycox did not describe the uniforms of the soldiers correctly. Haycox promptly purchased a book on the Revolutionary era military uniforms. After his move back to Oregon in 1926, Haycox concentrated on Westerns, and he precisely researched the military uniforms of eras he wrote about.[6]\\nAppearing in Collier\\'s between 1933 and 1938, these stories are set in New Hope, a trading town on the Missouri River in the 1880s. Many of these stories are told in the first person, a device Haycox used about a dozen times during his writing career.[7]\\nBeginning in the mid-1930s, Haycox began to write novels and a few stories which are based on historical events. The first of these was Trouble Shooter (1936), followed by The Border Trumpet (1939), Alder Gulch (1942) and Bugles in the Afternoon (1943). Trouble Shooter, according to Haycox\\' son, Ernest Haycox, Jr. was based upon Charles Sharman\\'s journal of his experiences as a civil engineer constructing the Union Pacific Railroad to Promontory Point in 1869.[8]\\nAt the same time as these novels were written, Haycox continued to write novels and short stories which had an ambiance and milieu of the West but which were not based on specific events or places. Somewhere in between these two kinds of novels is Trail Town, which is based on Abilene, Kansas, and Marshal Tom Smith,[9] but which is nonetheless a work of fiction, where Abilene becomes River Bend and Tom Smith becomes Dan Mitchell. Haycox did write a story set in Abilene with Sheriff Tom Smith as a character called On Texas Street. Haycox\\'s historical novels are the ones which Professors Etulain and Tanner write most about in their essays and books about Haycox, but Luke Short preferred Haycox\\'s non-historical novels: \"My favorite Haycox yarns don’t lean on a known time or place…. In these stories, I suspect Haycox made his own geography, named his own towns and mountains and rivers; he peopled them with tough abrasive characters whose only law was their self will.\"[10]\\nHaycox wrote National Beauty in 1939 about a woman in Oregon who wins beauty contests, and goes to Hollywood, but is not successful in the movie industry.  Collier\\'s declined this novel,[11] and the manuscript apparently was destroyed, as it was not included in the preserved Ernest Haycox Papers.[12]  Collier\\'s also rejected the story \"Boyhood.\"[13]\\nStarting in 1940 Haycox published five stories in Collier’s about settlers in a town named Ingrid.  The stories are \"Some Were Brave\" (1940) (later retitled \"Land Rush\"), \"Dark Land Waiting\" (1940), \"The Claim Jumpers\" (1940), \"Faithfully, Judith\" (1942), and \"Deep Winter\" (1943).  A sixth story, \"Early Fall,\" was one of Haycox\\'s rare rejections.[14]\\nHaycox was one of the most successful writers in the slick magazine market of the 1940s. In 1943 Collier\\'s and The Saturday Evening Post serialized two different Haycox novels at the same time.  Collier\\'s serialized The Wild Bunch beginning on August 28, 1943, and continued on September 4, 1943, September 11, 1943, September 18, 1943,\\nSeptember 25, 1943 and concluded on October 2, 1943.  The Saturday Evening Post serialized Bugles in the Afternoon beginning on August 21, 1943 and continued August 28, 1943, September 4, 1943, September 11, 1943, September 18, 1943, September 25, 1943, October 2, 1943, and concluded on October 9, 1943.[15]\\nAt the end of 1948 through the beginning of 1949 Haycox published three stories, one in Collier\\'s and two in The Saturday Evening Post, featuring the Mercy family.

While his early work was for Harman and Ising\\'s \"Barney Bear\" series, his longest collaboration was with director Tex Avery. Allen was credited as story artist on many classic Avery shorts, included Swing Shift Cinderella, Northwest Hounded Police, and King-Size Canary, among many others. Allen downplayed his contributions to the shorts, claiming that Avery merely used him as a sounding board for his own ideas.[5] He was later fired by Fred Quimby and went to work for Walter Lantz Productions[6] on several Woody Woodpecker cartoons that he co-wrote with Ben Hardaway including Wet Blanket Policy and Wild and Woody!. Following the 1948 shutdown of Walter Lantz Productions,[7] Allen returned to MGM and continued to write for Avery\\'s cartoons that were released during the 1950s including Little Johnny Jet, The Three Little Pups, and The First Bad Man.\\nAllen\\'s career as a novelist began in 1950, with the publication of his first Western No Survivors.

He was wounded in 1945, and the injuries included broken legs, foot, and ankle, facial burns, and temporary blindness.[6]\\nHillerman attended the University of Oklahoma after the war, meeting Marie Unzner, a student in microbiology. The couple wed and had one biological child and five adopted children.[3] He graduated in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in journalism.[6]\\nFrom 1948 to 1962, he worked as a journalist, moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1952.[7] In 1966, he moved his family to Albuquerque, where he earned a master\\'s degree from the University of New Mexico. During his time as a writer for the Borger News-Herald in Borger, Texas, he became acquainted with the sheriff of Hutchinson County, the man upon whom he would pattern the main character in his Joe Leaphorn novels. He taught journalism from 1966 to 1987 at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, and also began writing novels. He lived there with his wife Marie until his death in 2008. At the time of his death, they had been married 60 years and had 10 grandchildren.[3][8]\\nA consistently bestselling author, he was ranked as New Mexico\\'s 22nd-wealthiest man in 1996. He wrote 18 books in his Navajo series. He wrote more than 30 books total, among them a memoir and books about the Southwest, its beauty, and its history. His literary honors were awarded for his Navajo books. Hillerman\\'s books have been translated into eight languages, among them Danish and Japanese.[7][8]\\nHillerman\\'s writing is noted for the cultural details he provides about his subjects: Hopi, Zuni, European settlers, federal agents, and especially the Navajo Nation Police. His works in nonfiction and in fiction reflect his appreciation of the natural wonders of the American Southwest and his appreciation of its indigenous people, particularly the Navajo. His mystery novels are set in the Four Corners area of New Mexico and Arizona, sometimes reaching into Colorado and Utah, with occasional forays to the big cities of Washington, DC, Los Angeles, and New York City. The protagonists are Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee of the Navajo Nation Police. Lt. Leaphorn was introduced in Hillerman\\'s first novel, The Blessing Way (1970). Sgt. Jim Chee was introduced in the fourth novel, People of Darkness. The two first work together in the seventh novel, Skinwalkers,[9] considered his breakout novel, with a distinct increase in sales with the two police officers working together.[7]\\nHillerman repeatedly acknowledged his debt to an earlier series of mystery novels written by  British-born Australian author Arthur W. Upfield and set among Australian Aborigines in remote desert regions of tropical and subtropical Australia. The Upfield novels were first published in 1928 and featured a half-European, half-aboriginal Australian hero, Detective-Inspector Napoleon (Bony) Bonaparte. Bony worked with deep understanding of Aboriginal traditions. The character was based on the achievements of an Aboriginal person known as Tracker Leon, whom Upfield had met during his years in the Australian bush.[7]\\nHillerman discussed his debt to Upfield in many interviews and in his introduction to the posthumous 1984 reprint of Upfield\\'s A Royal Abduction. In the introduction, he described the appeal of the descriptions in Upfield\\'s crime novels. It was descriptions both of the harsh Outback areas and of \"the people who somehow survived upon them\" that lured him. \"When my own Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police unravels a mystery because he understands the ways of his people, when he reads the signs in the sandy bottom of a reservation arroyo, he is walking in the tracks Bony made 50 years ago.\"[10]\\nHe also mentioned Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, and Raymond Chandler as authors who influenced him as he wrote the Leaphorn and Chee novels.[7]\\nIn an interview published in Le Monde, Hillerman said his Navajo name means \"He who is afraid of his horse\".[11]\\nTony Hillerman died on October 26, 2008, of pulmonary failure in Albuquerque at the age of 83,[3] and was interred at Santa Fe National Cemetery.[12]\\nHillerman\\'s novels were popular in France. Hillerman credits that popularity both to French curiosity about other cultures and to his translator, Pierre Bondil.[11][13]\\nHillerman is considered one of New Mexico\\'s foremost novelists.[14] The Tony Hillerman Library was dedicated in Albuquerque in 2008,[15] and the Tony Hillerman Middle School (part of Volcano Vista High School) opened in 2009.[16] Dance Hall of the Dead, published in 1973, earned Hillerman the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière in 1987, a French international literary honor. Hillerman was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Literature (Litt.D.) from the University of New Mexico in 1990.[17] He was awarded the Owen Wister Award in 2008 for \"Outstanding Contributions to the American West.\"[18]\\nHillerman was a decorated combat veteran of World War II; he earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart as a mortarman in the 103rd Infantry Division.\\nHe won and was nominated for numerous awards for his writing and his work with other writers. His first nomination came in 1972, with his novel The Fly on the Wall being nominated for an Edgar Award in the \"Best Mystery Novel\" category. Two years later his novel Dance Hall of the Dead, second book in the Leaphorn-Chee series, won the 1974 Edgar Award for Best Novel.[1] He was again nominated for the \"Best Mystery Novel\" Edgar Award in 1979 for Listening Woman and lastly in 1989 for A Thief of Time.[1] Hillerman\\'s non-fictional work Talking Mysteries was nominated in 1992 for the Edgar Award in the \"Best Critical or Biographical\" category.[19]\\nIn 1987, Hillerman received the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière for Dance Hall of the Dead. In 1991, Hillerman received the MWA\\'s Grand Master Award. Hillerman received the Nero Award for Coyote Waits[20] and the Navajo Tribe\\'s Special Friends of the Dineh Award.[2]\\nHillerman has also been successful at the annual Anthony Awards. His novel Skinwalkers won the 1988 Anthony Award for \"Best Novel\", and in the following year A Thief of Time was nominated for the 1989 Anthony Award in the same category.[21] His next nomination was for his Talking Mysteries non-fictional work which was nominated at the 1992 Anthony Awards.[21] His novel Sacred Clowns received a \"Best Novel\" nomination at the 1994 Anthony Awards, and the following year his short-story collection The Mysterious West won the 1995 Anthony Award in the \"Best Anthology/Short Story Collection\" category.[21] His last win came at the 2002 Anthony Awards at which he won the \"Best Non-fiction/Critical Work\" award for his memoir Seldom Disappointed.[21]\\nTwo of the Navajo Police novels won The Spur award, given by the Western Writers of America annually. Skinwalkers won the award in 1987 for Western Novel, and The Shape Shifter won in 2007 for Best Western Short Novel.[22]\\n Seldom Disappointed: A Memoir won the Agatha Award in 2001.[23]\\nHillerman\\'s novels were recognized at the Macavity Awards. A Thief of Time won the \"Best Novel\" award in 1989, and Talking Mysteries won the \"Best Critical/Biographical\" award in 1992.[24] Seldom Disappointed also received a nomination in the \"Best Biographical/Critical Mystery Work\" category in 2002.[24]\\nHe received the Parris Award in 1995 by Southwest Writer\\'s Workshop for his outstanding service to other writers.[25] In 2002, Hillerman received the Agatha Malice Domestic Award for Lifetime Achievement, given by Malice Domestic for mystery novels in the spirit of Agatha Christie.[2][26]\\nThe first three books feature Joe Leaphorn only (and only as a supporting secondary character in the first novel.) The next three books feature Jim Chee only. Leaphorn and Chee begin working together in the seventh novel, Skinwalkers.\\nIn 2013, Hillerman\\'s daughter Anne Hillerman published Spider Woman\\'s Daughter (ISBN\\xa00062270486), the first new novel since 2006 featuring Hillerman\\'s Navajo Police characters; the novel\\'s protagonist is Jim Chee\\'s wife, Officer Bernadette Manuelito. Leaphorn\\'s involvement is curtailed in the first chapter of the book. Leaphorn is the victim of an assassination attempt, spends half of the book in a coma, and later was severely limited in his ability to communicate. Chee and Bernadette Manuelito are the crime solvers from that book forward in the series, with Leaphorn never fully active in the investigations (though he regains his faculties over time and consults often). \\n',\n",

       "  '\\nRobert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 – June 11, 1936) was an American writer who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He created the character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre.\\nHoward was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. A bookish and intellectual child, he was also a fan of boxing, eventually taking up amateur boxing, and spent some time in his late teens bodybuilding. From the age of nine, he longed to become a writer of adventure fiction but did not have real success until he was 23. Thereafter, until his death by suicide at age 30, Howard\\'s writings were published in a wide selection of magazines, journals, and newspapers, and he became proficient in several subgenres. His greatest success occurred after his death.\\nAlthough a Conan novel was nearly published in 1934, Howard\\'s stories were never collected during his lifetime. The main outlet for his stories was Weird Tales, where Howard created Conan the Barbarian. With Conan and his other heroes, Howard helped fashion the genre now known as sword and sorcery, spawning many imitators and giving him a large influence in the fantasy field. Howard remains a highly read author, with his best works still reprinted, and is one of the best-selling fantasy writers of all time.\\nHoward\\'s suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have led to speculation about his mental health. His mother had been ill with tuberculosis her entire life, and upon learning she had entered a coma from which she was not expected to wake, he walked out to his car parked outside his kitchen window and shot himself in the head while sitting in the driver\\'s seat. He died eight hours later.\\nHoward was born January 22, 1906, in Peaster, Texas, the only son of a traveling country physician, Dr. Isaac Mordecai Howard, and his wife, Hester Jane Ervin Howard.[4][5][nb 3][nb 4][nb 5]  His early life was spent wandering through a variety of Texas cowtowns and boomtowns: Dark Valley (1906), Seminole (1908), Bronte (1909), Poteet (1910), Oran (1912), Wichita Falls (1913), Bagwell (1913), Cross Cut (1915), and Burkett (1917).[4][6][7]\\nDuring Howard\\'s youth his parents\\' relationship began to break down. The Howard family had problems with money, which might have been exacerbated by Isaac Howard investing in get-rich-quick schemes. Hester Howard, meanwhile, came to believe that she had married below herself.  Soon the pair were actively fighting. Hester did not want Isaac to have anything to do with their son.[8] She had a particularly strong influence on her son\\'s intellectual growth.[9][10] She had spent her early years helping a variety of sick relatives, contracting tuberculosis in the process. She instilled in her son a deep love of poetry and literature, recited verse daily and supported him unceasingly in his efforts to write.[11]\\nOther experiences would later seep into his prose. Although he loved reading and learning, he found school to be confining and began to hate having anyone in authority over him.[12][13] Experiences watching and confronting bullies revealed the omnipresence of evil and enemies in the world, and taught him the value of physical strength and violence.[14]  As the son of the local doctor, Howard had frequent exposure to the effects of injury and violence, due to accidents on farms and oil fields combined with the massive increase in crime that came with the oil boom.[15] Firsthand tales of gunfights, lynchings, feuds, and Indian raids developed his distinctly Texan, hardboiled outlook on the world.[16]  Sports, especially boxing, became a passionate preoccupation.[17] At the time, boxing was the most popular sport in the country, with a cultural influence far in excess of what it is today. James J. Jeffries, Jack Johnson, Bob Fitzsimmons, and later Jack Dempsey were the names that inspired during those years, and he grew up a lover of all contests of violent, masculine struggle.\\nVoracious reading, along with a natural talent for prose writing and the encouragement of teachers, created in Howard an interest in becoming a professional writer.[10][18] From the age of nine he began writing stories, mostly tales of historical fiction centering on Vikings, Arabs, battles, and bloodshed.[19][20] One by one he discovered the authors who would influence his later work: Jack London and his stories of reincarnation and past lives, most notably The Star Rover (1915); Rudyard Kipling\\'s tales of subcontinent adventures; the classic mythological tales collected by Thomas Bulfinch. Howard was considered by friends to be eidetic, and astounded them with his ability to memorize lengthy reams of poetry with ease after one or two readings.[10][21][22]\\nIn 1919, when Howard was thirteen, Dr. Howard moved his family to the Central Texas hamlet of Cross Plains, and there the family would stay for the rest of Howard\\'s life.[4][7][23]  Howard\\'s father bought a house in the town with a cash down payment and made extensive renovations.[24]  That same year, sitting in a library in New Orleans while his father took medical courses at a nearby college, Howard discovered a book concerned with the scant fact and abundant legends surrounding an indigenous culture in ancient Scotland called the Picts.[25][26]\\nIn 1920, the Vestal Well within the limits of Cross Plains struck oil and Cross Plains became an oil boomtown.  Thousands of people arrived in the town looking for oil wealth. New businesses sprang up from scratch and the crime rate increased to match.  Cross Plains\\' population quickly grew from 1,500 to 10,000, it suffered overcrowding, the traffic ruined its unpaved roads and vice crime exploded but it also used its new wealth on civic improvements, including a new school, an ice manufacturing plant, and new hotels.[27]  Howard hated the boom and despised the people who came with it.[28]  He was already poorly disposed towards oil booms as they were the cause of the constant traveling in his early years but this was aggravated by what he perceived to be the effect oil booms had on towns.\\n\"I\\'ll say one thing about an oil boom; it will teach a kid that Life\\'s a pretty rotten thing as quick as anything I can think of.\"\\n—Robert E. Howard in a letter to Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright, Summer 1931.[29]At fifteen Howard first sampled pulp magazines, especially Adventure and its star authors Talbot Mundy and Harold Lamb.[30][31] The next few years saw him creating a variety of series characters.[19][32] Soon he was submitting stories to magazines such as Adventure and Argosy.[20][33] Rejections piled up, and with no mentors or instructions of any kind to aid him, Howard became a writing autodidact, methodically studying the markets and tailoring his stories and style to each.[34][35]\\nIn the fall of 1922, when Howard was sixteen, he temporarily moved to a boarding house in the nearby city of Brownwood to complete his senior year of high school, accompanied by his mother.[36][37][38] It was in Brownwood that he first met friends his own age who shared his interest not only for sports and history but also writing and poetry. The two most important of these, Tevis Clyde Smith and Truett Vinson, shared his Bohemian and literary outlook on life, and together they wrote amateur papers and magazines, exchanged long letters filled with poetry and existential thoughts on life and philosophy, and encouraged each other\\'s writing endeavors.  Through Vinson, Howard was introduced to The Tattler, the newspaper of the Brownwood High School.  It was in this publication that Howard\\'s stories were first printed.  The December 1922 issue featured two stories, \"\\'Golden Hope Christmas\" and \"West is West\", which won gold and silver prizes respectively.[19][38][39]\\nHoward graduated from high school in May 1923 and moved back to Cross Plains.[40] On his return to his home town he engaged in a self-created regimen of exercise, including cutting down oak trees and chopping them into firewood every day, lifting weights, punching a bag and springing exercises, eventually building himself from a skinny teenager into a more muscled, burly form.[41]\\nHoward spent his late teens working odd jobs around Cross Plains, all of which he hated. In 1924, Howard returned to Brownwood to take a stenography course at Howard Payne College, this time boarding with his friend Lindsey Tyson instead of his mother. Howard would have preferred a literary course but was not allowed to take one.  The reason for this is undocumented, however biographer Mark Finn suggests that his father refused to pay for such a non-vocational education.[13][42] In the week of Thanksgiving that year, and after years of rejection slips and near acceptances, he finally sold a short caveman tale titled \"Spear and Fang\", which netted him the sum of $16 and introduced him to the readers of a struggling pulp called Weird Tales.[19][20][43]\\nNow that his career in fiction had begun, Howard dropped out of Howard Payne College at the end of the semester and returned to Cross Plains. Shortly afterwards, he received notice that another story, \"The Hyena\", had been accepted by Weird Tales.[44] During the same period, Howard made his first attempt to write a novel, a loosely autobiographical book modeled on Jack London\\'s Martin Eden and titled Post Oaks & Sand Roughs. The book was otherwise of middling quality and was never published in the author\\'s lifetime, but it is of interest to Howard scholars for the personal information it contains.  Howard\\'s alter ego in this novel is Steve Costigan, a name he would use more than once in the future. The novel was finished in 1928, but not published until long after his death.[45]\\nWeird Tales paid on publication, meaning that Howard had no money of his own at this time.  To remedy this, he took a job writing oil news for the local newspaper Cross Plains Review at $5 per column.  It was not until July 1925 that Howard received payment for his first printed story.[46][47]  Howard lost his job at the newspaper in the same year and spent one month working in a post office before quitting over the low wages. His next job, at the Cross Plains Natural Gas Company, did not last long due to his refusal to be subservient to his boss.  He did manual labor for a surveyor for a time before beginning a job as a stenographer for an oil company.[48][49]\\nIn conjunction with his friend Tevis Clyde Smith, he dabbled heavily in verse, writing hundreds of poems and getting dozens published in Weird Tales and assorted poetry journals.  With poor sales, and many publishers recoiling from his subject matter, Howard ultimately judged poetry writing a luxury he could not afford, and after 1930 he wrote little verse, instead dedicating his time to short stories and higher-paying markets.[50] Nevertheless, as a result of this apprenticeship, his stories increasingly took on the aura of \"prose-poems\" filled with hypnotic, dreamy imagery and a power lacking in most other pulp efforts of the time.[51]\\nFurther story sales to Weird Tales were sporadic but encouraging, and soon Howard was a regular in the magazine. His first cover story was for \"Wolfshead\", a werewolf story published when he was only twenty.[47][50][52] On reading \"Wolfshead\" in Weird Tales Howard became dismayed with his writing. He quit his stenographer\\'s job to work at Robertson\\'s Drug Store, where he rose to become head soda jerk on $80 per week. However, he resented the job itself and worked such long hours every day of the week that he became ill. He relaxed by visiting the Neeb Ice House, to which he was introduced by an oil field worker befriended at the drug store, to drink and began to take part in boxing matches.  These matches became an important part of his life; the combination of boxing and writing provided an outlet for his frustrations and anger.[47][50][53][54]\\nIn August 1926, Howard quit his exhausting job at the drug store and, in September, returned to Brownwood to complete his bookkeeping course.[50]  It was during this August that he began working on the story that would become \"The Shadow Kingdom\", one of the most important works of his career.  While at college, Howard wrote for their newspaper, The Yellow Jacket.  One of the short stories printed in this newspaper was a comedy called \"Cupid vs. Pollux\".  This story is Howard\\'s earliest surviving boxing story known to exist; it is told in the first person, uses elements of a traditional tall-tale and is a fictionalized account of Howard (as \"Steve\") and his friend Lindsey Tyson (as \"Spike\") training for a fight.  This story and the elements it uses would also be important in Howard\\'s literary future.[55]\\nIn May 1927, after having to return home due to contracting measles and then being forced to retake the course, Howard passed his exams.  While waiting for the official graduation in August, he returned to writing, including a re-write of \"The Shadow Kingdom\".  He rewrote it again in August and submitted it to Weird Tales in September.[56]  This story was an experiment with the entire concept of the \"weird tale\" horror fiction as defined by practitioners such as Edgar Allan Poe, A. Merritt, and H. P. Lovecraft, mixing elements of fantasy, horror and mythology with historical romance, action and swordplay into thematic vehicles never before seen, a new style of tale that ultimately became known as \"sword and sorcery\".[nb 6][nb 7][57][58] Featuring Kull, a barbarian precursor to later Howard heroes such as Conan, the tale hit Weird Tales in August 1929 and received fanfare from readers. Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright bought the story for $100, the most Howard had earned for a story at this time, and several more Kull stories followed.  However, all but two were rejected, convincing Howard not to continue the series.[59][60]\\nIn March 1928, Howard salvaged and re-submitted to Weird Tales a story rejected by the more popular pulp Argosy, and the result was \"Red Shadows\", the first of many stories featuring the vengeful Puritan swashbuckler Solomon Kane.[61][62] Appearing in the August 1928 issue of Weird Tales, the character was a big hit with readers and this was the first of Howard\\'s characters to sustain a series in print beyond just two stories, with seven Kane stories printed from 1928 to 1932.[63]  As the magazine published the Solomon Kane tale before Kull, this can be considered the first published example of sword and sorcery.[64]\\n1929 was the year Howard broke out into other pulp markets, rather than just Weird Tales.  The first story he sold to another magazine was \"The Apparition in the Prize Ring\", a boxing-related ghost story published in the magazine Ghost Stories.[65]  In July of the same year, Argosy finally published one of Howard\\'s stories, \"Crowd-Horror\", which was also a boxing story.[65]  Neither developed into ongoing series, however.\\nAfter several minor successes and false starts, he struck gold again with a new series based on one of his favorite passions: boxing. July 1929 saw the debut of Sailor Steve Costigan in the pages of Fight Stories.[50][66] A tough-as-nails, two-fisted mariner with a head of rocks and occasionally a heart of gold, Costigan began boxing his way through a variety of exotic seaports and adventure locales, becoming so popular in Fight Stories that the same editors began using additional Costigan episodes in their sister magazine Action Stories.[67] The series saw a return to Howard\\'s use of humor and (unreliable) first-person narration, with the combination of a traditional tall tale and slapstick comedy.[68] Stories sold to Fight Stories provided Howard with a market just as stable as Weird Tales.[54]\\nDue to his success in Fight Stories, Howard was contacted by the publisher Street & Smith in February 1931 with a request to move the Steve Costigan stories to their own pulp Sport Story Magazine.  Howard refused but created a new, similar series just for them based on a boxer called Kid Allison.  Howard wrote ten stories for this series but Sport Story only published three of them.[69][70]\\nWith solid markets now all buying up his stories regularly, Howard quit taking college classes, and indeed would never again work a regular job. At twenty-three years of age, from the middle of nowhere in Texas, he had become a full-time writer; he was making good money and his father began bragging about his success, not to mention buying multiple copies of his work in the pulps.[71][72]\\nHoward\\'s \"Celtic phase\" began in 1930, during which he became fascinated by Celtic themes and his own Irish ancestry.  He shared this enthusiasm with Harold Preece, a friend made in Austin in the summer of 1927; Howard\\'s letters to both Preece and Clyde Smith contain much Irish-related material and discussion.  Howard taught himself a little Gaelic, examined the Irish parts of his family history and began writing about Irish characters. Turlogh Dubh O\\'Brien and Cormac Mac Art were created at this time, although he was not able to sell the latter\\'s stories.[73]\\nWhen Farnsworth Wright started a new pulp in 1930 called Oriental Stories, Howard was overjoyed—here was a venue where he could run riot through favorite themes of history and battle and exotic mysticism. During the four years of the magazine\\'s existence, he crafted some of his very best tales, gloomy vignettes of war and rapine in the Middle and Far East during the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance, tales that rival even his best Conan stories for their historical sweep and splendor. In addition to series characters such as Turlogh Dubh O\\'Brien and Cormac Fitzgeoffrey, Howard sold a variety of tales depicting various times and periods from the fall of Rome to the fifteenth century.  The magazine eventually ceased publication in 1934 due to the Depression, leaving several of Howard\\'s stories aimed at this market unsold.[69][74][75]\\nIn August 1930 Howard wrote a letter to Weird Tales praising a recent reprint of H. P. Lovecraft\\'s \"The Rats in the Walls\" and discussing some of the obscure Gaelic references used within. Editor Farnsworth Wright forwarded the letter to Lovecraft, who responded warmly to Howard, and soon the two Weird Tales veterans were engaged in a vigorous correspondence that would last for the rest of Howard\\'s life.[76][77][78] By virtue of this, Howard quickly became a member of the \"Lovecraft Circle\", a group of writers and friends all linked via the immense correspondence of H. P. Lovecraft (who wrote over 100,000 letters in his lifetime[79]), who made it a point to introduce his many like-minded friends to one another and encourage them to share stories, utilize each other\\'s invented fictional trappings, and help each other succeed in the pulp field.[80] In time this circle of correspondents has developed a legendary patina about it rivaling similar literary conclaves such as The Inklings, the Bloomsbury Group, and the Beats.[nb 8]\\nHoward was given the affectionate nickname \"Two-Gun Bob\" by virtue of his long explications to Lovecraft about the history of his beloved Southwest, and during the ensuing years he contributed several notable elements to Lovecraft\\'s Cthulhu Mythos of horror stories (beginning with \"The Black Stone\", his Mythos stories also included \"The Cairn on the Headland\", \"The Children of the Night\" and \"The Fire of Asshurbanipal\"). He also corresponded with other \"Weird Tale\" writers such as Clark Ashton Smith, August Derleth, and E.\\xa0Hoffmann Price.[81][82]\\nThe correspondence between Howard and Lovecraft contained a lengthy discussion on a frequent element in Howard\\'s fiction, barbarism versus civilization. Howard held that civilization was inherently corrupt and fragile. This attitude is summed up in his famous line from \"Beyond the Black River\": \"Barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural.  It is a whim of circumstance. And barbarism must always ultimately triumph.\" Lovecraft held the opposite viewpoint, that civilization was the peak of human achievement and the only way forward. Howard countered by listing many historic abuses of the citizenry by so-called \\'civilized\\' leaders.[83] Howard initially deferred to Lovecraft but gradually asserted his own views, even coming to deride Lovecraft\\'s opinions.[77]\\nIn 1930, with his interest in Solomon Kane dwindling and his Kull stories not catching on, Howard applied his new sword-and-sorcery and horror experience to one of his first loves: the Picts. His story \"Kings of the Night\" depicted King Kull conjured into pre-Christian Britain to aid the Picts in their struggle against the invading Romans, and introduced readers to Howard\\'s king of the Picts, Bran Mak Morn. Howard followed up this tale with the now-classic revenge nightmare \"Worms of the Earth\" and several other tales, creating horrific adventures tinged with a Cthulhu-esque gloss and notable for their use of metaphor and symbolism.[26][69][84]\\nWith the onset of the Great Depression, many pulp markets reduced their schedules or went out of business entirely. Howard saw market after market falter and vanish.  Weird Tales became a bimonthly publication and pulps such as Fight Stories, Action Stories, and Strange Tales all folded.[85][86][87]  Howard was further hit when his savings were wiped out in 1931 when the Farmer\\'s National Bank failed, and again, after transferring to another bank, when that one failed as well.[84][clarification needed]\\nEarly 1932 saw Howard taking one of his frequent trips around Texas. He traveled through the southern part of the state with his main occupation being, in his own words, \"the wholesale consumption of tortillas, enchiladas and cheap Spanish wine.\"  In Fredericksburg, while overlooking sullen hills through a misty rain, he conceived of the fantasy land of Cimmeria, a bitter hard northern region home to fearsome barbarians. In February, while in Mission, he wrote the poem Cimmeria.[89][90]\\nIt was also during this trip that Howard first conceived of the character of Conan.  Later, in 1935, Howard claimed in a letter to Clark Ashton Smith that Conan \"simply grew up in my mind a few years ago when I was stopping in a little border town on the lower Rio Grande.\"  However, the character actually took nine months to develop.[89][91][92]\\nHoward had originally used the name \"Conan\" for a Gael reaver in a past-life-themed story he completed in October 1931, which was published in the magazine Strange Tales in June 1932.  Although the character swears by the god \"Crom\", that is his only link to the more famous successor character.[93]\\nGoing back home he developed the idea, fleshing out a new invented world—his Hyborian Age—and populating it with all manner of countries, peoples, monsters, and magic. Howard loved history and enjoyed writing historical stories.  However, the research necessary for a purely historical setting was too time-consuming for him to engage in on a regular basis and still earn a living.  The Hyborian Age, with its varied settings similar to real places and eras of history, allowed him to write fantastical historical fiction without such problems. He may have been inspired in the creation of his setting by Thomas Bulfinch\\'s 1913 edition of his Bulfinch\\'s Mythology called The Outline of Mythology, which contained stories from history and legend, including many that were direct influences on Howard\\'s work.[94]  Another potential inspiration is G. K. Chesterton\\'s The Ballad of the White Horse and Chesterton\\'s concept that \"it is the chief value of legend to mix up the centuries while preserving the sentiment.\"[95]\\nBy March, Howard had recycled an unpublished Kull story called \"By This Axe I Rule!\" into his first Conan story.  The central plot remains that of a barbarian having become king of a civilized country and a conspiracy to assassinate him.  However, he removed an entire subplot concerning a couple\\'s romance and created a new one with a supernatural element; the story was re-titled \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", an element from this new subplot.  Howard immediately went on to write two more Conan stories. The first of these was \"The Frost-Giant\\'s Daughter\", an inversion of the Greek myth surrounding Apollo and Daphne, set much earlier in Conan\\'s life.  The last of the initial trio was \"The God in the Bowl\", which went through three drafts and has a slower pace than most Conan stories.  This one is a murder mystery filled with corrupt officials and serves as Conan\\'s introduction into civilization, while showing that he is a more decent person than the civilized characters. Before the end of the month, he sent the first two stories to Weird Tales in the same package, with the third following a few days later.[96][97][98]\\nWith these three completed he created an essay called \"The Hyborian Age\" in order to flesh out his setting in more detail.  There were four drafts of this essay, starting with a two-page outline and finishing as an 8,000-word essay. Howard supplemented this with two sketched maps and an additional short piece entitled \"Notes on Various Peoples of the Hyborian Age.\"[99][100]\\nIn a letter dated March 10, 1932, Farnsworth Wright rejected \"The Frost-Giant\\'s Daughter\" but noted that \"The Phoenix on the Sword\" had \"points of real excellence\" and suggested changes.  \"The God in the Bowl\" would also be rejected and so a potential fourth Conan story concerning Conan as a thief was abandoned at the synopsis stage.[102] Instead of abandoning the entire Conan concept, as had happened with previous failed characters, Howard rewrote \"The Phoenix on the Sword\" based on Wright\\'s feedback and including material from his essay.  Both this revision and the next Conan story, \"The Tower of the Elephant\", sold with no problems.  Howard had written nine Conan stories before the first saw print.[103]\\nConan first appeared to the public in Weird Tales in December 1932 and was such a hit that Howard was eventually able to place seventeen Conan stories in the magazine between 1933 and 1936. Howard then took a short break from Conan after his initial burst of stories, returning to the character in mid-1933.  These stories, his \"middle period\", are routine and considered the weakest of the series.[69][104][105]  Stories, such as \"Iron Shadows in the Moon\", were often simply Conan rescuing a damsel in distress from a monster in some ruins. While earlier Conan stories had three or four drafts, some in this period had only two including the final version.  \"Rogues in the House\" is the only Conan story to be completed in a single draft.  These stories sold easily and they include the first and second Conan stories to feature on the cover of Weird Tales, \"Black Colossus\" and \"Xuthal of the Dusk\".[101][106]  Howard\\'s motivation for quick and easy sales at this time was influenced by the collapse of some other markets, such as Fight Stories, in the Depression.[87]\\nAlso in this period, Howard wrote the first of the James Allison stories, \"Marchers of Valhalla\".  Allison is a disabled Texan who begins to recall his past lives, the first of which is in the later part of Howard\\'s new Hyborian age. In a letter to Clark Ashton Smith in October 1933, he wrote that its sequel \"The Garden of Fear\" was \"dealing with one of my various conceptions of the Hyborian and post-Hyborian world.\"[107]\\nIn May 1933, a British publisher, Denis Archer, contacted Howard about publishing a book in the United Kingdom. Howard submitted a batch of his best available stories, including \"The Tower of the Elephant\" and \"The Scarlet Citadel\", on June 15. In January 1934 the publisher rejected the collection but suggested a novel instead.[104][105] Though the publisher was \"exceedingly interested\" in the stories, the rejection letter explained that there was a \"prejudice that is very strong over here just now against collections of short stories.\" The suggested novel, however, could be published by Pawling and Ness Ltd in a first edition of 5,000 copies for lending libraries.[108]\\nIn late 1933 Howard returned to Conan, starting again slightly awkwardly with \"The Devil in Iron\".[109]  However, this was followed with the beginning of the latter group of Conan stories that \"carry the most intellectual punch,\" starting with \"The People of the Black Circle\".[101]\\nHoward probably began to work on the novel in February 1934, starting to write Almuric (a non-Conan, sword and planet science fiction novel) but abandoned it half way.[110]  This was followed by another abortive attempt at a novel, this time a Conan novel that later became Drums of Tombalku.[110]  The third attempt at writing the novel was more successful, resulting in Howard\\'s only Conan novel The Hour of the Dragon, which was probably started on or around March 17, 1934.[111]  This novel combines elements of two previous Conan stories, \"Black Colossus\" and \"The Scarlet Citadel\", with Arthurian myth and provides an overview of Conan and the Hyborian age for the new British audience.[112]  Howard sent his final draft to Denis Archer on May 20, 1934. He had worked exclusively on the novel for two months, writing approximately 5,000 words per day, seven days a week.  Although he told acquaintances that he had little hope for this novel, he had put a lot of effort into it.[113] However, the publisher went into receivership in late 1934, before it could print the novel.  The story was briefly held as part of the company\\'s assets before being returned to Howard.  It was later printed in Weird Tales as a serial over five months, beginning with the December 1935 issue.[114]\\nHoward may have begun losing interest in Conan in late 1934, with a growing desire to write westerns.[115]  He began to write, although never finished, a Conan story called \"Wolves Beyond the Border\".  This was the first Conan tale to have an explicit (Robert W. Chambers-influenced) American setting, although American themes had appeared earlier, and the only one in which Conan himself does not appear.[116]  His next story was based on his unfinished material and became \"Beyond the Black River\", which not only used the different American-frontier setting but was also, in Howard\\'s own words, a \"Conan yarn without sex interest.\"  In another novel twist, Conan and the other protagonists have, at best, a pyrrhic victory; this was rare for pulp magazines.[117]  This was followed by another experimental Conan story, \"The Black Stranger\", with a similar setting.  The story was, however, rejected by Weird Tales, which was rare for later Conan stories.  Howard\\'s next piece, \"The Man-Eaters of Zamboula\", was more formulaic and was accepted by the magazine with no problems.[118]  Howard only wrote one more Conan story, \"Red Nails\", which was influenced both by his personal experiences at the time and an extrapolation of his views on civilization.[119]\\nThe character of Conan had a wide and enduring influence among other Weird Tales writers, including C. L. Moore and Fritz Leiber, and over the ensuing decades the genre of sword and sorcery grew up around Howard\\'s masterwork, with dozens of practitioners evoking Howard\\'s creation to one degree or another.[citation needed]\\nIn spring 1933, Howard started to place work with Otis Adelbert Kline, a former pulp writer, as his agent.  Kline encouraged him to try writing in other genres in order to expand into different markets.  Kline\\'s agency was successful in finding outlets for more of Howard\\'s stories and even placed works that had been rejected when Howard was marketing himself alone.  Howard continued to sell directly to Weird Tales, however.[87][98][120][121]\\nHoward wrote one of the first \"Weird Western\" stories ever created, \"The Horror from the Mound\", published in the May 1932 issue of Weird Tales.  This genre acted as a bridge between his early \"weird\" stories (a contemporary term for horror and fantasy) and his later straight western tales.[122][123]\\nHe tried writing detective fiction but hated reading mystery stories and disliked writing them; he was not successful in this genre.[120][122] More successfully, in late 1933 Howard took a character conceived in his youth, El Borak, and began using him in mature, professional tales of World War I-era Middle Eastern adventure that landed in Top Notch, Complete Stories, and Thrilling Adventures.  The 1920s version was a treasure-hunting adventurer but the 1930s version, first seen in \"The Daughter of Erlik Khan\" in the December 1934 issue of Top-Notch, was a grim gun-fighter keeping the peace after having gone native in Afghanistan.  The stories have a lot in common with those of Talbot Mundy, Harold Lamb and T. E. Lawrence, with Western themes and Howard\\'s hardboiled style of writing. As with his other series, he created another character in the same vein, Kirby O\\'Donnell, but this character lacked the grim, western elements and was not as successful.[124][125]\\nIn the years since Conan had been created, Howard found himself increasingly fascinated with the history and lore of Texas and the American Southwest. Many of his letters to H. P. Lovecraft ran for a dozen pages or more, filled with stories he had picked up from elderly Civil War veterans, Texas Rangers, and pioneers. His Conan stories began featuring western elements, most notably in \"Beyond the Black River\", \"The Black Stranger\", and the unfinished \"Wolves Beyond the Border\". By 1934 some of the markets killed off by the Depression had come back, and Weird Tales was over $1500 behind on payments to Howard. The author therefore stopped writing weird fiction and turned his attentions to this steadily growing passion.[126]\\nThe first of Howard\\'s most commercially successful series (within his own lifetime) was started in July 1933.  \"Mountain Man\" was the first of the Breckinridge Elkins stories, humorous westerns in a similar style to his earlier Sailor Steve Costigan stories and again featuring an exaggerated, cartoonish version of Howard himself as the main character.  Written as tall tales in the vein of Texas \"Tall Lying\" stories, the story first appeared in the March–April 1934 issue of Action Stories and was so successful that other magazines asked Howard for similar characters.  Howard created Pike Bearfield for Argosy and Buckner J. Grimes for Cowboy Stories.  Action Stories published a new Elkins story every issue without fail until well after Howard\\'s death.  At Kline\\'s suggestion, he also created A Gent from Bear Creek, a Breckinridge Elkins novel comprising existing short stories and new material.[123][127][128]\\nConan remained the only character that Howard ever spoke of with his friends in Texas and the only one in whom they seemed interested.  It is possible that Breckinridge Elkins and the other characters in his stories were too close to home for Howard to be entirely comfortable discussing them.[129]\\nIn the spring of 1936, Howard sold a series of \"spicy\" stories to Spicy-Adventure Stories.  The \"spicy\" series of pulp magazines dealt in stories that were considered borderline softcore pornography at the time but are now similar to romance novels.  These stories, which Howard referred to as \"bubby-twisters\", featured the character Wild Bill Clanton and were published under the pseudonym Sam Walser.[69][130]\\nHoward is known to have had only one girlfriend in his life, Novalyne Price.  Price was an ex-girlfriend of Tevis Clyde Smith, one of Howard\\'s best friends, whom she had known since high school; Smith and Price had remained friends after their relationship ended.  In the spring of 1933, Howard was visiting Smith after driving his mother to a Brownwood clinic.  Howard and Smith drove to the Price farm and Smith introduced his friends to each other.  Price was an aspiring writer, had heard of Howard from Smith in the past, and was enthusiastic to meet him in person.  However, he was not what she expected.  She wrote in her diary about this first meeting: \"This man was a writer! Him? It was unbelievable. He was not dressed as I thought a writer should dress.\" They parted after a drive and would not see each other again for over a year.[133][134]\\nIn late 1934, Price got a job as a schoolteacher in Cross Plains High School through her cousin, who was the head of the English department.  When Howard came up in conversation with her new colleagues, she defended him from accusations of being a \"freak\" and \"crazy\", then phoned his house and left a message.  When the call was not returned, she tried a few more times.  Price finally visited the Howard house in person after having her telephone calls blocked by Hester Howard.  After a drive through town, Howard and Price arranged their first date.[134][135]\\nOver much of the next two years, they dated on and off, spending much time discussing writing, philosophy, history, religion, reincarnation, and much else.  Both considered marriage but never at the same time.[134][136]  Price became ill from overwork in mid-1935.  Her doctor, a friend of Howard\\'s father, advised her to end the relationship and get a job in a different state. Despite agreeing to this, she met with Howard soon after being discharged.  Howard, however, was too preoccupied with the state of his mother\\'s health to give her the attention she wanted.  Their relationship did not last much longer.[137]\\nNot considering herself to be in an exclusive relationship, Price began dating one of Howard\\'s best friends, Truett Vinson.  Howard discovered his friends\\' relationship while he and Truett were on a week\\'s trip together to New Mexico (the same trip that inspired a lot of the final Conan story \"Red Nails\").[131][132]  The relationship between Howard and Price was irrevocably scarred, but they continued visiting with each other as friends until May 1936, when Price left Cross Plains for to pursue a graduate degree at Louisiana State University.  The two never spoke or wrote to each other again.[138]\\nIn an effort to improve her memory and writing, Price had begun recording all her daily conversations into a journal, in the process preserving an intimate record of her time with Howard.  This was useful years later when she wrote of their relationship in her book One Who Walked Alone.  This book became the basis for the 1996 film The Whole Wide World starring Vincent D\\'Onofrio as Howard and Renée Zellweger as Price.[139]\\nBy 1936, almost all of Howard\\'s fiction writing was being devoted to westerns. The novel A Gent from Bear Creek was due to be published by Herbert Jenkins in England, and by all accounts it looked as if he was finally breaking out of the pulps and into the more prestigious book market. However, life was becoming especially difficult for Howard. All of his close friends had married and were immersed in their careers, Novalyne Price had left Cross Plains for graduate school, and his most reliable market, Weird Tales, had grown far behind on its payments. His home life was also falling apart. Having suffered from tuberculosis for decades, his mother was finally nearing death. The constant interruptions of care workers at home, combined with frequent trips to various sanatoriums for her care, made it nearly impossible for Howard to write.[140][141][142][143]\\nIn hindsight, there were hints about Howard\\'s plans. Several times in 1935–36, whenever his mother\\'s health had declined, he made veiled allusions to his father about planning suicide, which his father did not understand at the time.[144] He had made references when speaking to Novalyne Price about being in his \"sere and yellow leaf\". The words sounded familiar to her, but it was only in early June 1936 that she found the source in Macbeth:[145]\\nI have liv\\'d long enough: my way of lifeIs fall\\'n into the sere, the yellow leaf;And that which should accompany old age,As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,I must not look to have; but, in their stead,Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.In the weeks before his suicide, Howard wrote to Kline giving his agent instructions of what to do in case of his death, he wrote his last will and testament, and he borrowed a .380 Colt Automatic from his friend Lindsey Tyson. On June 10, he drove to Brownwood and bought a burial plot for the whole family.[146] On the night before his suicide, when his father confirmed that his mother was finally dying, he asked where his father would go afterwards. Isaac Howard replied that he would go wherever his son went, thinking he meant to leave Cross Plains. It is possible that Howard thought his father would join him in ending their lives together as a family.[144][147]\\n\"All fled, all done, so lift me on the pyre;The feast is over and the lamps expire.\"\\n—Howard\\'s suicide note, found in his typewriter after the event.  The lines were taken from the poem \"The House of Cæsar\" by Viola Garvin.[148][149]In June 1936, as Hester Howard slipped into her final coma, her son maintained a death vigil with his father and friends of the family, getting little sleep, drinking huge amounts of coffee, and growing more despondent. On the morning of June 11, 1936, Howard asked one of his mother\\'s nurses, a Mrs. Green, if his mother would ever regain consciousness.  When she told him no, he walked out to his car in the driveway, took the pistol from the glove box, and shot himself in the head.[127][148][150] He died eight hours later,[148] and his mother died the following day. The story occupied the entirety of that week\\'s edition of the Cross Plains Review, along with the publication of Howard\\'s \"A Man-Eating Jeopard\". On June 14, 1936, a double funeral service was held at Cross Plains First Baptist Church, and both were buried in Greenleaf Cemetery in Brownwood, Texas.[127][146][149]\\nRobert E. Howard\\'s health, especially his mental health, has been the focus of the biographical and critical analysis of his life. In terms of physical health, Howard had a weak heart, which he treated by taking Digoxin.[47][120] The precise nature of Howard\\'s mental health has been much debated, both during his life and following his suicide.[151] Three main points of view exist: some have declared that Howard suffered from an Oedipal complex or similar;[152] another viewpoint is that Howard suffered from major depressive disorder;[153] the third view is that Howard had no disorders and his suicide was a common reaction to stress.[154]\\nHoward\\'s attitude towards race and racism is debated.[155][156] Howard used race as shorthand for physical characteristics and motivation.  He would also employ some racial stereotypes, possibly for the sake of simplification.[157]  He was also of the belief that, no matter who won the subsequent conflicts, it would only ever be a temporary victory. In \"Wings in the Night\", for instance, Howard writes that:\\nThe ancient empires fall, the dark-skinned peoples fade and even the demons of antiquity gasp their last, but over all stands the Aryan barbarian, white-skinned, cold-eyed, dominant, the supreme fighting man of the earth.[158][159]Howard became less racist as he grew older, due to several influences. Later works include more sympathetic black characters, as well as other minority groups, such as Jews.[160] Significant works in terms of Howard\\'s views on race are \"Black Canaan\" and \"The Last White Man\", which depict white protagonists at war with black characters defined by barbarity.[156][161]\\nHoward had feminist views, despite his era and location, which he espoused in both personal and professional life. Howard wrote to his friends and associates defending the achievements and capabilities of women.[162][163] Strong female characters in Howard\\'s works of fiction include the protofeminist Dark Agnes de Chastillon (first appearing in \"Sword Woman\", circa 1932–1934); the early modern pirate Helen Tavrel (\"The Isle of Pirates\\' Doom\", 1928), two pirates and Conan supporting characters, Bêlit (\"Queen of the Black Coast\", 1934) and Valeria of the Red Brotherhood (\"Red Nails\", 1936); as well as the Ukrainian mercenary Red Sonya of Rogatino (\"The Shadow of the Vulture\", 1934).[164][165]\\nPhysically, Howard was tall and heavily built. He had a gentle, round face with a soft, deep voice.[166] E. Hoffmann Price wrote that when he first met Howard in 1934 he \"was busy trying to combine two images, that of the actual man, and that of the man who loomed up in those stirring yarns. The synthesis was never effected. He was packed with the whimsy and poetry which rang out in his letters, and blazed up in much of his published fiction, but, as is usually the case with writers, his appearance belied him. His face was boyish, not yet having squared off into angles; his blue eyes slightly prominent, had a wide-openness which did not suggest anything of the man\\'s keen wit and agile fancy. That first picture persists—a powerful, solid, round-faced fellow, kindly and somewhat stolid seeming.\"[167]\\nHoward enjoyed listening to other people\\'s stories. He listened to tales told by family members growing up and, as an adult, collected stories from any older people willing to tell them.[168] Howard\\'s parents were both natural storytellers of different kinds and he grew up in early 20th century Texas, an environment in which the telling of tall tales was a standard form of entertainment.[169] Howard himself was a natural storyteller and later a professional storyteller. Combined, this often led to Howard embellishing facts in his communication, not with an intention to deceive but just to make a better story. This can be a problem for biographers reading his works and letters with an aim to understand Howard himself.[170]\\nHoward had an almost photographic memory and could memorize long poems after only a few readings.[21] Howard also enjoyed listening to music and drama on the radio. However his main interests were sports and politics, and he would listen to match reports and election results as they came in.[171]\\nAfter Howard bought a car in 1932, he and his friends took regular excursions across Texas and nearby states. His letters to Lovecraft also contain information about the history and geography he encountered on his journeys.[172] Howard was also a practitioner and fan of boxing, as well as an avid weightlifter.\\nHoward\\'s first published poem was The Sea, in an early 1923 issue of local newspaper The Baylor United Statement.[173] His first published story was \"Spear and Fang\", sold in late November 1924 and published in the July 1925 issue of the pulp magazine Weird Tales.[19][20][43]  However, Howard\\'s first real success was the Sailor Steve Costigan series of humorous boxing stories, beginning with \"The Pit of the Serpent\" published in the July 1929 issue of the pulp magazine Fight Stories.[174]\\nHoward\\'s distinctive literary style relies on a combination of existentialism, poetic lyricism, violence, grimness, humour, burlesque, and a degree of hardboiled realism.[citation needed]  Howard\\'s background in Texan tall tales is the source of the rhythm, drive and authenticity of his work.[175] Howard used an economy of words to sketch out scenes in his stories; his ability to do so has been attributed to his skill with, and experience of, both tall tales and poetry.[176] The tone of Howard\\'s works, especially in the Conan stories, is hardboiled and dark.[citation needed]  This is contrasted with the fantastic elements contained within the stories.[177]  Direct experience of the oil booms in early 20th century Texas influenced Howard\\'s view of civilization.  The benefits of progress came with lawlessness and corruption.[178]  One of the most common themes in Howard\\'s writing is based on his view of history, a repeating pattern of civilizations reaching their peak, becoming decadent, decaying and then being conquered by another people.  Many of his works are set in the period of decay or among the ruins the dead civilization leaves behind.[179]\\nI have carefully gone over, in my mind, the most powerful men—that is, in my opinion—in all of the world\\'s literature and here is my list: Jack London, Leonid Andreyev, Omar Khayyam, Eugene O\\'Neill, William Shakespeare. All these men, and especially London and Khayyam, to my mind stand out so far above the rest of the world that comparison is futile, a waste of time.  Reading these men and appreciating them makes a man feel life is not altogether useless.\\n—Robert E. Howard, letter to Tevis Clyde Smith, February 20, 1928[180]The oil boom in Texas was \"one of the most powerful influences on [Howard\\'s] life and art\", albeit one that he hated.  Howard grew to despise the oil industry along with everyone and everything associated with it.  The oil boom heavily influenced Howard\\'s view of civilization as a constant cycle of boom and bust in the same manner as the oil industry in contemporary Texas.  A town such as Cross Plains was built by pioneers. The boom brought civilization in the form of people and investment but also social breakdown.  The oil people contributed little or nothing to the town in the long term and eventually left for the next oil field.  This led Howard to see civilization as corrupting and society as a whole in decay.[181][182]\\nHoward first bought a pulp magazine, a copy of Adventure, when he was fifteen.  The stories and writers featured in this magazine were a strong influence on Howard.  In the same year, he sent his first story, \"Bill Smalley and the Power of the Human Eye\", to the magazine, although it was rejected.  Despite repeated attempts during his life, Howard never sold a story to Adventure.[31][183]\\nHoward was both influenced by and an influence on his friend H. P. Lovecraft.  Many ideas that he discussed in his letters to Lovecraft were repeated in his fiction and the discussion with a fellow professional writer was useful to him.  For his part, Lovecraft began to include Howardian action sequences in his own work, for example in The Shadow over Innsmouth.[184] Much of 1931 was spent by Howard attempting to mimic Lovecraft\\'s style.  After that year, he had absorbed the parts of it that worked best for him and made them his own.[185]\\nAnother inspiration for Howard was Theosophy and the theories of Helena Blavatsky and William Scott-Elliot, who described lost civilizations, ancient wisdom, races, magic and sunken continents and the lands of Lemuria, Atlantis and Hyperborea, and also influenced other writers of weird fiction.[186]\\nHoward influenced and inspired later writers including Samuel R. Delany, David Gemmell, Michael Moorcock, Matthew Woodring Stover, Charles R. Saunders, Karl Edward Wagner, Paul Kearney, Steven Erikson, Joe R. Lansdale, and William King.[nb 9] He also has an influence on the field of fantasy fiction rivaled only by J. R. R. Tolkien and Tolkien\\'s similarly inspired creation of the modern genre of high fantasy.[nb 10]\\nAlthough he had his faults as a writer, Howard was a natural storyteller, whose narratives are unmatched for vivid, gripping, headlong action\\xa0... In fiction, the difference between a writer who is a natural storyteller and one who is not is like the difference between a boat that will float and one that will not. If the writer has this quality, we can forgive many other faults; if not, no other virtue can make up for the lack, any more than gleaming paint and sparkling brass on a boat make up for the fact that it will not float.\\n—L. Sprague de Camp, Conan of the Isles, \"Introduction\", 1968Criticism of Robert E. Howard and his work often turns towards biographical details and \"backhanded compliment[s].\"[187] Some imply that Howard was an uneducated idiot savant and that his success was due more to luck than skill.[188]\\nThe first professional critic to comment on Howard\\'s work was Hoffman Reynolds Hays, reviewing the Arkham House collection Skull-Face and Others in The New York Times Book Review.  Under the title \"Superman on a Psychotic Bender\", Hays wrote, \"Howard used a good deal of the Lovecraft cosmogony and demonology, but his own contribution was a sadistic conqueror who, when cracking heads did not solve his difficulties, had recourse to magic and the aid of Lovecraft\\'s Elder Gods. The stories are written on a competent pulp level (a higher level, by the way, than that of some best sellers) and are allied to the Superman genre which pours forth in countless comic books and radio serials.\"[189] Hays then moved on to Howard himself and the genre in which he wrote:\\nA sensitive boy, he was apparently bullied by his schoolmates. ... Howard\\'s heroes were consequently wish-projections of himself.  All of the frustrations of his own life were conquered in a dream world of magic and heroic carnage.  In exactly the same way Superman compensates for all the bewilderment and frustration in which the semi-literate product of the Industrial age finds himself enmeshed. The problem of evil is solved by an impossibly omnipotent hero. ... Thus the hero-literature of the pulps and the comics is symptomatic of a profound contradiction.  On the one hand it is testimony to insecurity and apprehension, and on the other it is a degraded echo of the epic.  But the ancient hero story was a glorification of significant elements in the culture that produced it.  Mr. Howard\\'s heroes project the immature fantasy of a split mind and logically pave the way to schizophrenia.[189]In a review of Michel Houellebecq\\'s essay \"H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life\" published in the Los Angeles Times, April 17, 2005, Stephen King implies that Howard did not work at his craft and was merely pastiching Lovecraft.[188] King described his disapproval of the sword and sorcery genre, and superheroes, in his book on writing Danse Macabre: \"[It] is not fantasy at its lowest, but it still has a pretty tacky feel. ... Sword and sorcery novels and stories are tales of power for the powerless. The fellow who is afraid of being rousted by those young punks who hang around his bus stop can go home at night and imagine himself wielding a sword, his potbelly miraculously gone, his slack muscles magically transmuted into those \"iron thews\" which have been sung and storied in the pulps for the last fifty years.\"[190]  On Howard in particular, he wrote:\\nHoward overcame the limitations of his puerile material by the force and fury of his writing and by his imagination, which was powerful beyond his hero Conan\\'s wildest dreams of power. In his best work, Howard\\'s writing seems so highly charged with energy that it nearly gives off sparks. Stories such as \"The People of the Black Circle\" glow with the fierce and eldritch light of his frenzied intensity. At his best, Howard was the Thomas Wolfe of fantasy, and most of his Conan tales seem to almost fall over themselves in their need to get out. Yet his other work was either unremarkable or just abysmal.[190]An exception to this, in King\\'s opinion (again from Danse Macabre) was the author\\'s Southern Gothic horror story \"Pigeons From Hell\".  King referred to this work as \"one of the finest horror stories of our century.\"\\nIn the foreword to \"Two-Gun Bob\", a collection of essays on the subject of Howard, fellow fantasy fiction writer, Michael Moorcock, wrote: \"The ability to paint a complex scene with a few expert brushstrokes remains Howard\\'s greatest talent, and such talent can\\'t, of course, ever be taught.\"[191]  Howard scholar Rob Roehm considers the use of the phrase \"can\\'t ever be taught\" to be a variation on the recurrent theme of Howard\\'s lack of skill or training.[188]  Moorcock\\'s foreword goes on \"[Howard\\'s] greatest hero, Conan the Barbarian, is his best, created from whole cloth, with a nod to Natty Bumppo and Tarzan of the Apes, and most closely representing the kind of person Howard, home-bound, mother-worshipping, suspicious of big cities, would in his dreams most like to be.\"[192]  Roehm counters that none of the assertions made about Howard in that comment are true, although none of them are unique to Moorcock either.[193]  In Wizardry & Wild Romance, Moorcock has also written both that Howard \"brought a brash, tough element to the epic fantasy that did as much to change the course of the American school away from previous writing and static imagery as Hammett, Chandler and the Black Mask pulp writers were to change the course of the American detective fiction\" and that he \"was never a commercially successful writer in his lifetime. His brash, hasty, careless style did not lend itself to the classier pulps. Most of his work appeared in the cheapest of them.\"[194]\\nThe following table shows Howard\\'s earnings from writing throughout his career, with appropriate milestones and events noted by each year. During the Depression, Howard earned more than anyone else in Cross Plains.[195] When Howard died, Weird Tales still owed him between $800 and $1,300.[196] (Adjusted for inflation, this amount would be equivalent to between $17,565 and $28,544.)\\nThree publishing houses have put out collections of Howard\\'s letters. In 1989 and 1991, Necronomicon Press published Robert E. Howard: Selected Letters in two volumes (1923–1930 and 1931–1936) edited by Glenn Lord with Rusty Burke, S. T. Joshi, and Steve Behrends. In 2007 and 2008, The Robert E. Howard Foundation Press published a three volume set (1923–1929, 1930–1932, and 1933–1936) titled The Collected Letters of Robert E. Howard, edited by Rob Roehm. Additionally, in 2009, Hippocampus Press published two volumes (1930–1932 and 1933–1936) of Howard\\'s correspondence with H. P. Lovecraft as A Means to Freedom: The Letters of H.P. Lovecraft & Robert E. Howard, edited by S. T. Joshi, David Schultz, and Rusty Burke.\\nRobert E. Howard\\'s legacy extended after his death in 1936.  Howard\\'s most famous character, Conan the Barbarian, has a pop-culture imprint that has been compared to such icons as Tarzan of the Apes, Count Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, and James Bond.  Howard\\'s critical reputation suffered at first but, over the decades, works of Howard scholarship have been published.  The first professionally published example of this was L. Sprague de Camp\\'s Dark Valley Destiny (1983), which was followed by other works including Don Herron\\'s The Dark Barbarian (1984) and Mark Finn\\'s Blood & Thunder (2006).  Also in 2006, a charity, Robert E. Howard Foundation, was created to promote further scholarship.\\nFollowing Robert E. Howard\\'s death, the courts granted his estate to his father, who continued to work with Howard\\'s literary agent Otis Adelbert Kline.  Dr. Isaac Howard passed the rights on to his friend Dr. Pere Kuykendall, who passed them to his wife, Alla Ray Kuykendall, and daughter, Alla Ray Morris.  Morris left the rights to the widow of her cousin, Zora Mae Bryant, who gave control to her children, Jack Baum and Terry Baum Rogers.  The Baums eventually sold their rights to the Swedish (now US) company Paradox Entertainment.\\nHoward\\'s first published book, A Gent from Bear Creek, was printed in Britain one year after his death.  This was followed in the United States by a collection of Howard\\'s stories, Skull-Face and Others (1946) and then the novel Conan the Conqueror (1950).  The success of Conan the Conqueror led to a series of Conan books from publisher Gnome Press, the later editor of which was L. Sprague de Camp.  The series led to the first Conan pastiche, the novel The Return of Conan by de Camp and Swedish Howard fan Björn Nyberg. De Camp eventually achieved control over the Conan stories and Conan brand in general.  Oscar Friend took over from Kline as literary agent and he was followed by his daughter Kittie West.  When she closed the agency in 1965, a new agent was required.  De Camp was offered the role but he recommended Glenn Lord instead.  Lord began as a fan of Howard and had re-discovered many unpublished pieces that would otherwise have been lost, printing them in books such as Always Comes Evening (1957) and his own magazine The Howard Collector (1961–1973).  He became responsible for the non-Conan works and later restored, textually-pure versions of the Conan stories themselves.\\nIn 1966, de Camp made a deal with Lancer Books to republish the Conan series, which led to the \"First Howard Boom\" of the 1970s; their popularity was enhanced by the cover artwork of Frank Frazetta on most of the volumes. Many of his works were reprinted (some printed for the first time) and they expanded into other media such as comic books and films.  The Conan stories were increasingly edited by de Camp and the series was extended by pastiches until they replaced the original stories.  In response, a puristic movement grew up demanding Howard\\'s original, un-edited stories. The first boom ended in the mid-1980s. In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the \"Second Howard Boom\" occurred.  This saw the printing of new collections of Howard\\'s work, with the restored texts desired by purists.  As before, the boom led to new comic books, films and computer games.  Howard\\'s house in Cross Plains has been converted into the Robert E. Howard Museum, which has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.\\nThe works of Robert E. Howard have been adapted into multiple media, such as the two Conan films released in the 1980s starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and another in 2011 starring Jason Momoa. In addition to the Conan films, other adaptations have included Kull the Conqueror (1997) and Solomon Kane (2009). In television, the anthology series Thriller (1961) led the adaptations with an episode based on the short story \"Pigeons from Hell\". The bulk of the adaptations have, however, been based on Conan with two animated and one live action series. Multiple audio dramas have been adapted, from professional audio books and plays to LibriVox recordings of works in the public domain. Computer games have focussed on Conan, beginning with Conan: Hall of Volta (1984) and continuing on to the MMO Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures (2008). The first table-top roleplaying game based on Howard\\'s works was TSR\\'s \"Conan Unchained!\" (1984) for their game Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. The first comic book adaptation was in the Mexican Cuentos de Abuelito – La Reina de la Costa Negra No. 17 (1952).  Howard-related comic books continued to be published to the present day.\\nHoward is an ongoing inspiration for and influence on heavy metal music. Several bands have adapted Howard\\'s works to tracks or entire albums. The British metal band Bal-Sagoth is named after Howard\\'s story \"The Gods of Bal-Sagoth\".\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nLaura Elizabeth Ingalls Wilder (February 7, 1867 – February 10, 1957) was an American writer. The Little House on the Prairie series of children\\'s books, published between 1932 and 1943, were based on her childhood in a settler and pioneer family.[1]\\nThe television series Little House on the Prairie (1974–1983) was loosely based on the books, and starred Melissa Gilbert as Laura and Michael Landon as her father, Charles Ingalls.[2]\\nLaura Elizabeth Ingalls was born to Charles Phillip and Caroline Lake (née Quiner) Ingalls on February 7, 1867.  At the time of her birth, the family lived seven miles north of the village of Pepin, Wisconsin, in the Big Woods region of Wisconsin. Ingalls\\' home in Pepin became the setting for her first book, Little House in the Big Woods (1932).[3]  She was the second of five children, following her older sister, Mary Amelia.[4][5][6][7] Three more children would follow, Caroline Celestia (Carrie), Charles Frederick, who died in infancy, and Grace Pearl. Ingalls Wilder\\'s birth site is commemorated by a replica log cabin at the Little House Wayside in Pepin.[8]\\nIngalls was a descendant of the Delano family, the ancestral family of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.[9][10] One paternal ancestor, Edmund Ingalls, from Skirbeck, Lincolnshire, England, emigrated to America, settling in Lynn, Massachusetts.[9]\\nLaura was the 7th great-granddaughter of the Mayflower passenger Richard Warren.[11] She was a third cousin once removed of the U.S. President and Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant.[12]\\nWhen she was two years old, Laura moved with her family from Wisconsin (in 1869). After stopping in Rothville, Missouri, they settled in the Indian country of Kansas, near modern-day Independence, Kansas. Her younger sister, Carrie, was born in Independence in August 1870, not long before they moved again. According to Ingalls Wilder, her father Charles Ingalls had been told that the location would be open to white settlers, but when they arrived this was not the case. The Ingalls family had no legal right to occupy their homestead because it was on the Osage Indian reservation. They had just begun to farm when they heard rumors that settlers would be evicted, so they left in the spring of 1871. Despite the fact that, in her novel, Little House on the Prairie and her Pioneer Girl memoir, Ingalls portrayed their departure as being prompted by rumors of eviction, she also noted that her parents needed to recover their Wisconsin land because the buyer had not paid the mortgage.[13]\\nThe Ingalls family went back to Wisconsin where they lived for the next three years. Those experiences formed the basis for Wilder\\'s first two novels, Little House in the Big Woods (1932) and the beginning of Little House on the Prairie (1935).\\n\\nIn the book On the Banks of Plum Creek (published in 1939), the third volume of her fictionalized history which takes place around 1874, the Ingalls family moves from Kansas to an area near Walnut Grove, Minnesota, settling in a dugout on the banks of Plum Creek.[14]  They moved there from Wisconsin when Ingalls was about seven years old, after briefly living with the family of her uncle, Peter Ingalls, first in Wisconsin and then on rented land near Lake City, Minnesota. In Walnut Grove, the family first lived in a dugout sod house on a preemption claim; after wintering in it, they moved into a new house built on the same land. Two summers of ruined crops led them to move to Iowa. On the way, they stayed again with Charles Ingalls\\' brother, Peter Ingalls, this time on his farm near South Troy, Minnesota. Her brother, Charles Frederick Ingalls (\"Freddie\"), was born there on November 1, 1875, dying nine months later in August 1876. In Burr Oak, Iowa, the family helped run a hotel. The youngest of the Ingalls children, Grace, was born there on May 23, 1877.\\nThe family moved from Burr Oak back to Walnut Grove where Charles Ingalls served as the town butcher and justice of the peace. He accepted a railroad job in the spring of 1879, which took him to eastern Dakota Territory, where they joined him that fall. Ingalls Wilder omitted the period in 1876–1877 when they lived near Burr Oak, skipping to Dakota Territory, portrayed in By the Shores of Silver Lake (1939).\\nIngalls\\' father filed for a formal homestead over the winter of 1879–1880.[15] De Smet, South Dakota became home for her parents and her blind sister Mary for the remainder of their lives. After spending the mild winter of 1879–1880 in the surveyor\\'s house, they watched the town of De Smet rise up from the prairie in 1880. The following winter, known as the Hard Winter of 1880–81, one of the most severe on record in the Dakotas, was later described by Ingalls Wilder in her novel, The Long Winter (1940). Once the family was settled in De Smet, Ingalls attended school, worked several part-time jobs, and made friends. Among them was bachelor homesteader Almanzo Wilder. This time in her life is documented in the books Little Town on the Prairie (1941) and These Happy Golden Years (1943).\\nOn December 10, 1882, two months before her 16th birthday, Ingalls accepted her first teaching position.[16] She taught three terms in one-room schools when she was not attending school in De Smet. (In Little Town on the Prairie she receives her first teaching certificate on December 24, 1882, but that was an enhancement for dramatic effect.[citation needed]) Her original \"Third Grade\" teaching certificate can be seen on page 25 of William Anderson\\'s book Laura\\'s Album (1998).[17] She later admitted she did not particularly enjoy it, but felt a responsibility from a young age to help her family financially, and wage-earning opportunities for women were limited. Between 1883 and 1885, she taught three terms of school, worked for the local dressmaker, and attended high school, although she did not graduate. (According to the books, this was due to her third and final teaching job starting before her schooling finished.)\\nIngalls\\' teaching career and studies ended when she married Almanzo Wilder on August 25, 1885, in De Smet, South Dakota.[18][19] From the beginning of their relationship, the pair had nicknames for each other: she called him \"Manly\" and he called her \"Bess,\" from her middle name Elizabeth, to avoid confusion with his sister, who was also named Laura.[19] Almanzo had achieved a degree of prosperity on his homestead claim;[20] the newly married couple started their life together in a new home, north of De Smet.[21]\\nOn December 5, 1886, Wilder gave birth to her daughter, Rose.  In 1889, she gave birth to a son who died at 12 days of age before being named. He was buried at De Smet, Kingsbury County, South Dakota.[22][23] On the grave marker, he is remembered as \"Baby Son of A. J. Wilder.\"[24]\\nTheir first few years of marriage were difficult. Complications from a life-threatening bout of diphtheria in 1888 left Almanzo partially paralyzed. Although he eventually regained nearly full use of his legs, he needed a cane to walk for the remainder of his life. This setback, among many others, began a series of unfortunate events that included the death of their newborn son, the destruction of their barn along with its hay and grain by a mysterious fire,[25] the total loss of their home from a fire accidentally set by Rose,[26] and several years of severe drought that left them in debt, physically ill, and unable to earn a living from their 320 acres (129.5 hectares) of prairie land. These trials were documented in Wilder\\'s book The First Four Years (published in 1971). Around 1890, they left De Smet and spent about a year resting at the home of Almanzo\\'s parents on their Spring Valley, Minnesota, farm before moving briefly to Westville, Florida, in search of a climate to improve Almanzo\\'s health. They found, however, that the dry plains they were used to were very different from the humidity they encountered in Westville. The weather, along with feeling out of place among the locals, encouraged their return to De Smet in 1892, where they purchased a small home.[27][28]\\nIn 1894, the Wilders moved to Mansfield, Missouri, and used their savings to make the down payment on an undeveloped parcel of land just outside town. They named the place Rocky Ridge Farm[29] and moved into a ramshackle log cabin. At first, they earned income only from wagon loads of fire wood they would sell in town for 50 cents.  Financial security came slowly. Apple trees they planted did not bear fruit for seven years. Almanzo\\'s parents visited around that time and gave them the deed to the house they had been renting in Mansfield, which was the economic boost Wilder\\'s family needed. They then added to the property outside town, and eventually accrued nearly 200 acres (80.9 hectares). Around 1910, they sold the house in town, moved back to the farm, and completed the farmhouse with the proceeds. What began as about 40 acres (16.2 hectares) of thickly wooded, stone-covered hillside with a windowless log cabin became in 20 years a relatively prosperous poultry, dairy, and fruit farm, and a 10-room farmhouse.[30]\\nThe Wilders had learned from cultivating wheat as their sole crop in De Smet. They diversified Rocky Ridge Farm with poultry, a dairy farm, and a large apple orchard. Wilder became active in various clubs and was an advocate for several regional farm associations. She was recognized as an authority in poultry farming and rural living, which led to invitations to speak to groups around the region.[31]\\nAn invitation to submit an article to the Missouri Ruralist in 1911 led to Wilder\\'s permanent position as a columnist and editor with that publication, which she held until the mid-1920s. She also took a paid position with the local Farm Loan Association, dispensing small loans to local farmers.\\nWilder\\'s column in the Ruralist, \"As a Farm Woman Thinks,\" introduced her to a loyal audience of rural Ozarkians, who enjoyed her regular columns. Her topics ranged from home and family, including her 1915 trip to San Francisco, California to visit her now-married daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, and see the Pan-Pacific exhibition, to World War I and other world events, and to the fascinating world travels of Lane as well as her own thoughts on the increasing options offered to women during this era. While the couple were never wealthy until the \"Little House\" books began to achieve popularity, the farming operation and Wilder\\'s income from writing and the Farm Loan Association provided them with a stable living.\\n\"[By] 1924\", according to the Professor John E. Miller, \"[a]fter more than a decade of writing for farm papers, Wilder had become a disciplined writer, able to produce thoughtful, readable prose for a general audience.\" \\nAround this time her daughter, Lane, began intensively encouraging Wilder to improve her writing skills with a view toward greater success as a writer than Lane had already achieved.[32]  The Wilders, according to Miller, had come to \"[depend] on annual income subsidies from their increasingly famous and successful daughter.\" They both had concluded that the solution for improving their retirement income was for Wilder to become a successful writer herself. As a start, Lane helped Wilder publish two articles describing the interior of the farmhouse, in Country Gentleman magazine.[33] However, the \"project never proceeded very far.\"[34]\\nIn 1928, Lane hired out the construction of an English-style stone cottage for her parents on property adjacent to the farmhouse they had personally built and still inhabited. She remodeled and took it over.[35]\\nThe Stock Market Crash of 1929 wiped the Wilders out; Lane\\'s investments were devastated as well. They still owned the 200-acre (81-hectare) farm, but they had invested most of their savings with Lane\\'s broker. \\nIn 1930, Wilder requested Lane\\'s opinion about an autobiographical manuscript she had written about her pioneering childhood. The Great Depression, coupled with the deaths of Wilder\\'s mother in 1924 and her older sister in 1928, seem to have prompted her to preserve her memories in a life story called Pioneer Girl. She also hoped that her writing would generate some additional income. \\nThe original title of the first of the books was When Grandma Was a Little Girl.[36] On the advice of Lane\\'s publisher, she greatly expanded the story. As a result of Lane\\'s publishing connections as a successful writer and after editing by her, Harper & Brothers published Wilder\\'s book in 1932 as Little House in the Big Woods. After its success, she continued writing. The close and often rocky collaboration between her and Lane continued, in person until 1935, when Lane permanently left Rocky Ridge Farm, and afterward by correspondence.\\nThe collaboration worked both ways: two of Lane\\'s most successful novels, Let the Hurricane Roar (1932) and Free Land (1938), were written at the same time as the \"Little House\" series and basically retold Ingalls and Wilder family tales in an adult format.[37]\\nSome, including Lane\\'s biographer William Holtz, have alleged that Wilder\\'s daughter was her ghostwriter.[38]  Existing evidence including ongoing correspondence between the women about the books\\' development, Lane\\'s extensive diaries, and Wilder\\'s handwritten manuscripts with edit notations shows an ongoing collaboration between the two women.[21]\\nMiller, using this record, describes varying levels of involvement by Lane. Little House in the Big Woods (1932) and These Happy Golden Years (1943), he notes, received the least editing. \"The first pages...and other large sections of [Big Woods],\" he observes, \"stand largely intact, indicating...from the start...[Laura\\'s] talent for narrative description.\"[39]  Some volumes saw heavier participation by Lane,[40] while The First Four Years (1971) appears to be exclusively a Wilder work.[41]\\nMiller concludes that, \"[i]n the end, the lasting literary legacy remains that of the mother more than that of the daughter.... Lane possessed style; Wilder had substance.\"[37]\\nThe controversy over authorship is often tied to the movement to read the Little House series through an ideological lens. Lane emerged in the 1930s as an avowed conservative polemicist and critic of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration and his New Deal programs. According to a 2012 article in the New Yorker, \"When Roosevelt was elected, she noted in her diary, \\'America has a dictator.\\' She prayed for his assassination, and considered doing the job herself.\"[42] Whatever Lane\\'s politics, \"attacks on [Wilder\\'s] authorship seem aimed at infusing her books with ideological passions they just don\\'t have.\"[43]\\nOn the topic of historical fiction and its influence on modern views of race relations, literary scholar Rachelle Kuehl notes that Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House series has received backlash for her problematic portrayal of Native Americans.[44] They have also been the subject of postcolonial writing including Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner\\'s \"To Laura Ingalls Wilder\" included in her 2017 collection Iep Jaltok: Poems from a Marshallese Daughter.\\nThe original Little House books, written for elementary school–age children, became an enduring, eight-volume record of pioneering life late in the 19th century based on the Ingalls family\\'s experiences on the American frontier. Irene Smith said shortly after \"These Happy Golden Years (1943) was published that Wilder began \"with a style appealing to the eight-year-olds and continuing in volumes of increasing length and difficulty. This graduation is a distinguishing feature of the Little House books.\"[45] The First Four Years, about the early days of the Wilder marriage, was discovered by her literary executor Roger MacBride after Lane\\'s 1968 death and published in 1971, unedited by Lane or MacBride. It is now marketed as the ninth volume.[41]\\nSince the publication of Little House in the Big Woods (1932), the books have been continuously in print and have been translated into 40 other languages. Wilder\\'s first—and smallest—royalty check from Harper, in 1932, was for $500, equivalent to $11,170 in 2023. By the mid-1930s the royalties from the Little House books brought a steady and increasingly substantial income to the Wilders for the first time in their 50 years of marriage. The collaboration also brought the two writers at Rocky Ridge Farm the money they needed to recoup the loss of their investments in the stock market. Various honors,[46] huge amounts of fan mail,[47] and other accolades were bestowed on Wilder.\\nIn 1929–1930, in her early 60s, Wilder began writing her autobiography, titled Pioneer Girl. It was rejected by publishers. At Lane\\'s urging, she rewrote most of her stories for children. The result was the Little House series of books. In 2014, the South Dakota State Historical Society published an annotated version of Wilder\\'s autobiography, titled Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography.[48][49]\\nPioneer Girl includes stories that Wilder felt were inappropriate for children: e.g., a man accidentally immolating himself while drunk, and an incident of extreme violence of a local shopkeeper against his wife, which ended with his setting their house on fire. She also describes previously unknown facets of her father\\'s character. According to its publisher, \"Wilder\\'s fiction, her autobiography, and her real childhood are all distinct things, but they are closely intertwined.\" The book\\'s aim was to explore the differences, including incidents with conflicting or non-existing accounts in one or another of the sources.[50]\\nWilder has been referred to by some as one of America\\'s first libertarians.[51] She was a longtime Democrat, but became dismayed with Roosevelt\\'s New Deal and what she and her daughter, Rose Wilder Lane, saw as Americans\\' increasing dependence on the federal government. Wilder grew disenchanted with her party and resented government agents who came to farms like hers and grilled farmers about the number of acres they were planting.[52] Her daughter was similarly a strong libertarian.[53][52][54]\\nWilder supported women\\'s rights (though she worried that women would vote according to what their husbands wanted, and not as they wanted)[55] and education reform.[55] She also became infamous for a short period for shaking the hand of an African American man in segregated Missouri.[55] Indeed, part of the plot of Little House on the Prairie involves an African American doctor saving the Ingalls family\\'s lives.[56]\\nUpon Lane\\'s departure from Rocky Ridge Farm, Laura and Almanzo moved back into the farmhouse they had built, which had most recently been occupied by friends.[35]  From 1935 on, they were alone at Rocky Ridge Farm. Most of the surrounding area (including the property with the stone cottage Lane had built for them) was sold, but they still kept some farm animals, and tended their flower beds and vegetable gardens. Almost daily, carloads of fans stopped by, eager to meet the \"Laura\" of the Little House books.\\nThe Wilders lived independently and without financial worries until Almanzo\\'s death at the farm in 1949. Wilder remained on the farm. For the next eight years, she lived alone, looked after by a circle of neighbors and friends. She continued an active correspondence with her editors, fans, and friends during these years.\\nIn autumn 1956, 89-year-old Wilder became severely ill from undiagnosed diabetes and cardiac issues. She was hospitalized by Lane, who had arrived for Thanksgiving. She was able to return home on the day after Christmas.  However, her health declined after her release from the hospital, and she died at home in her sleep on February 10, 1957, at the age of 90.[57] She was buried beside Almanzo at Mansfield Cemetery in Mansfield. Lane was buried next to them upon her death in 1968.[58]\\nFollowing Wilder\\'s death, possession of Rocky Ridge Farm passed to the farmer who had earlier bought the property under a life lease arrangement.[59][60] The local population put together a non-profit corporation to purchase the house and its grounds for use as a museum.[61] After some wariness at the notion of seeing the house rather than the books be a shrine to Wilder, Lane came to believe that making a museum of it would draw long-lasting attention to the books. She donated the money needed to purchase the house and make it a museum, agreed to make significant contributions each year for its upkeep, and donated many of her parents\\' belongings.[62]\\nIn compliance with Wilder\\'s will, Lane inherited ownership of the Little House literary estate, with the stipulation that it be for only her lifetime, with all rights reverting to the Mansfield library after her death. Following her death in 1968, however, her chosen heir, as well as her business agent and lawyer Roger MacBride, gained control of the books\\' copyrights.[63] The copyrights to each of Wilder\\'s \"Little House\" books, as well as those of Lane\\'s own literary works, were renewed in his name after the original copyright had expired.[64][65]\\nControversy arose following MacBride\\'s death in 1995, when the Laura Ingalls Wilder Branch of the Wright County Library in Mansfield—the library founded in part by Wilder—tried to recover the rights to the series. The ensuing court case was settled in an undisclosed manner, with MacBride\\'s heirs retaining the rights to Wilder\\'s books. From the settlement, the library received enough to start work on a new building.[66]\\nThe popularity of the Little House books has grown over the years following Wilder\\'s death, spawning a multimillion-dollar franchise of mass merchandising under MacBride\\'s impetus.[67] Results of the franchise have included additional spinoff book series[68]—some written by MacBride and his daughter, Abigail—and the long-running television series, starring Melissa Gilbert as Wilder and Michael Landon as her father.\\nBecause she died in 1957, Wilder\\'s works are now public domain in countries where the term of copyright lasts 50 years after the author\\'s death, or less; generally this does not include works first published posthumously. Works first published before 1929 or where copyright was not renewed, primarily her newspaper columns, are also public domain in the United States.[citation needed]\\nThe eight \"original\" Little House books were published by Harper & Brothers with illustrations by Helen Sewell (the first three) or by Sewell and Mildred Boyle.\\nLittle House on the Prairie: The Legacy of Laura Ingalls Wilder (February 2015) is a one-hour documentary film that looks at the life of Wilder. Wilder\\'s story as a writer, wife, and mother is explored through interviews with scholars and historians, archival photography, paintings by frontier artists, and dramatic re-enactments.\\nLaura Ingalls Wilder: Prairie to Page (2020) is an 83-minutes documentary covering the life of Wilder, the authorship of the Little House books, the making of the television series, and her legacy.[85]\\nMultiple adaptations of Wilder\\'s Little House on the Prairie book series have been produced for screen and stage. In them, the following actresses have portrayed Wilder:\\nWilder was five times a runner-up for the annual Newbery Medal, the premier American Library Association (ALA) book award for children\\'s literature.[a] In 1954, the ALA inaugurated a lifetime achievement award for children\\'s writers and illustrators, named for Wilder, of which she was the first recipient. The Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal recognizes a living author or illustrator whose books, published in the United States, have made \"a substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children\". As of 2013, it has been conferred nineteen times, biennially starting in 2001.[96] In 2018, the award was renamed the Children\\'s Literature Legacy Award in light of language in Wilder\\'s works which the Association perceived as biased against Native Americans and African Americans.[97]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWashington Irving (April 3, 1783 – November 28, 1859) was an American short-story writer, essayist, biographer, historian, and diplomat of the early 19th century. He wrote the short stories \"Rip Van Winkle\" (1819) and \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" (1820), both of which appear in his collection The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. His historical works include biographies of Oliver Goldsmith, Muhammad, and George Washington, as well as several histories of 15th-century Spain that deal with subjects such as the Alhambra, Christopher Columbus, and the Moors. Irving served as American ambassador to Spain in the 1840s.\\nIrving was born and raised in Manhattan to a merchant family. He made his literary debut in 1802 with a series of observational letters to the Morning Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. He temporarily moved to England for the family business in 1815, where he achieved fame with the publication of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. which was serialized from 1819 to 1820. He continued to publish regularly throughout his life, and he completed a five-volume biography of George Washington just eight months before his death at age 76 in Tarrytown, New York.\\nIrving was one of the first American writers to earn acclaim in Europe, and he encouraged other American authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. He was also admired by some British writers, including Lord Byron, Thomas Campbell, Charles Dickens, Mary Shelley, Francis Jeffrey, and Walter Scott. He advocated for writing as a legitimate profession and argued for stronger laws to protect American writers from copyright infringement.\\nWashington Irving\\'s parents were William Irving Sr., originally of Quholm, Shapinsay, Orkney, Scotland, and Sarah (née Saunders), originally of Falmouth, Cornwall, England. They married in 1761 while William was serving as a petty officer in the British Navy. They had eleven children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. Their first two sons died in infancy, both named William, as did their fourth child John. Their surviving children were William Jr. (1766), Ann (1770), Peter (1771), Catherine (1774), Ebenezer (1776), John Treat (1778), Sarah (1780), and Washington.[1][2]\\nThe Irving family settled in Manhattan, and were part of the city\\'s merchant class. Washington was born on April 3, 1783,[1] the same week that New York City residents learned of the British ceasefire which ended the American Revolution. Irving\\'s mother named him after George Washington.[3] Irving met his namesake at age 6 when George Washington came to New York just before his inauguration as President in 1789. The President blessed young Irving,[4] an encounter that Irving had commemorated in a small watercolor painting which continues to hang in his home.[5]\\nThe Irvings lived at 131 William Street at the time of Washington\\'s birth, but they later moved across the street to 128 William Street.[6]  Several of Irving\\'s brothers became active New York merchants; they encouraged his literary aspirations, often supporting him financially as he pursued his writing career.\\nIrving was an uninterested student who preferred adventure stories and drama, and he regularly sneaked out of class in the evenings to attend the theater by the time he was 14.[7] An outbreak of yellow fever in Manhattan in 1798 prompted his family to send him upriver, where he stayed with his friend James Kirke Paulding in Tarrytown, New York. It was in Tarrytown where he became familiar with the bucolic beauty of the region with its Dutch customs and local ghost stories.[8] Though the town of Sleepy Hollow did not exist in Irving\\'s time (North Tarrytown changed its name to Sleepy Hollow in 1996), the area had been known as Slapershaven or \"Sleeper\\'s Haven\" by the Dutch.[9] Irving made several other trips up the Hudson as a teenager, including an extended visit to Johnstown, New York, where he passed through the Catskill Mountains region, the setting for \"Rip Van Winkle\". \"Of all the scenery of the Hudson\", Irving wrote, \"the Kaatskill Mountains had the most witching effect on my boyish imagination\".[10]\\nIrving began writing letters to the New York Morning Chronicle in 1802 when he was 19, submitting commentaries on the city\\'s social and theater scene under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. The name evoked his Federalist leanings[11] and was the first of many pseudonyms he employed throughout his career. The letters brought Irving some early fame and moderate notoriety. Aaron Burr was a co-publisher of the Chronicle, and was impressed enough to send clippings of the Oldstyle pieces to his daughter Theodosia. Charles Brockden Brown made a trip to New York to try to recruit Oldstyle for a literary magazine he was editing in Philadelphia.[12]\\nConcerned for his health, Irving\\'s brothers financed an extended tour of Europe from 1804 to 1806. He bypassed most of the sites and locations considered essential for the social development of a young man, to the dismay of his brother William who wrote that he was pleased that his brother\\'s health was improving, but he did not like the choice to \"gallop through Italy… leaving Florence on your left and Venice on your right\".[13] Instead, Irving honed the social and conversational skills that eventually made him one of the world\\'s most in-demand guests.[14] \"I endeavor to take things as they come with cheerfulness\", Irving wrote, \"and when I cannot get a dinner to suit my taste, I endeavor to get a taste to suit my dinner\".[15] While visiting Rome in 1805, Irving struck up a friendship with painter Washington Allston[13] and was almost persuaded into a career as a painter. \"My lot in life, however, was differently cast\".[16]\\nIrving returned from Europe to study law with his legal mentor Judge Josiah Ogden Hoffman in New York City. By his own admission, he was not a good student and barely passed the bar examination in 1806.[17] He began socializing with a group of literate young men whom he dubbed \"The Lads of Kilkenny\",[18] and he created the literary magazine Salmagundi in January 1807 with his brother William and his friend James Kirke Paulding, writing under various pseudonyms, such as William Wizard and Launcelot Langstaff. Irving lampooned New York culture and politics in a manner similar to the 20th century Mad magazine.[19] Salmagundi was a moderate success, spreading Irving\\'s name and reputation beyond New York. He gave New York City the nickname \"Gotham\" in its 17th issue dated November 11, 1807, an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \"Goat\\'s Town\".[20]\\n\\nIrving completed A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker (1809) while mourning the death of his 17-year-old fiancée Matilda Hoffman. It was his first major book and a satire on self-important local history and contemporary politics. Before its publication, Irving started a hoax by placing a series of missing person advertisements in the New York Evening Post seeking information on Diedrich Knickerbocker, a crusty Dutch historian who had allegedly gone missing from his hotel in New York City. As part of the ruse, he placed a notice from the hotel\\'s proprietor informing readers that, if Mr. Knickerbocker failed to return to the hotel to pay his bill, he would publish a manuscript that Knickerbocker had left behind.[21]\\nUnsuspecting readers followed the story of Knickerbocker and his manuscript with interest, and some New York city officials were concerned enough about the missing historian to offer a reward for his safe return. Irving then published A History of New York on December 6, 1809, under the Knickerbocker pseudonym, with immediate critical and popular success.[22] \"It took with the public\", Irving remarked, \"and gave me celebrity, as an original work was something remarkable and uncommon in America\".[23] The name Diedrich Knickerbocker became a nickname for Manhattan residents in general and was adopted by the New York Knickerbockers basketball team.[24]\\nAfter the success of A History of New York, Irving searched for a job and eventually became an editor of Analectic Magazine, where he wrote biographies of naval heroes such as James Lawrence and Oliver Hazard Perry.[25] He was also among the first magazine editors to reprint Francis Scott Key\\'s poem \"Defense of Fort McHenry\", which was immortalized as \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".[26] Irving initially opposed the War of 1812 like many other merchants, but the British attack on Washington, D.C., in 1814 convinced him to enlist.[27] He served on the staff of Daniel Tompkins, governor of New York and commander of the New York State Militia, but he saw no real action apart from a reconnaissance mission in the Great Lakes region.[28] The war was disastrous for many American merchants, including Irving\\'s family, and he left for England in mid-1815 to salvage the family trading company.  He remained in Europe for the next 17 years.[29]\\nIrving spent the next two years trying to bail out the family firm financially but eventually had to declare bankruptcy.[30] With no job prospects, he continued writing throughout 1817 and 1818. In the summer of 1817, he visited Walter Scott, beginning a lifelong personal and professional friendship.[31]\\nIrving composed the short story \"Rip Van Winkle\" overnight while staying with his sister Sarah and her husband, Henry van Wart, in Birmingham, England, a place that inspired other works as well.[32] In October 1818, Irving\\'s brother William secured for Irving a post as chief clerk to the United States Navy and urged him to return home.[33] Irving turned the offer down, opting to stay in England to pursue a writing career.[34]\\nIn the spring of 1819, Irving sent to his brother Ebenezer in New York a set of short prose pieces that he asked be published as The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. The first installment, containing \"Rip Van Winkle\", was an enormous success, and the rest of the work was equally successful; it was issued in 1819–1820 in seven installments in New York and in two volumes in London (\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" appeared in the sixth issue of the New York edition and the second volume of the London edition).[35]\\nLike many successful authors of this era, Irving struggled against literary bootleggers.[36] In England, some of his sketches were reprinted in periodicals without his permission, a legal practice as there was no international copyright law at the time. To prevent further piracy in Britain, Irving paid to have the first four American installments published as a single volume by John Miller in London.\\nIrving appealed to Walter Scott for help procuring a more reputable publisher for the remainder of the book. Scott referred Irving to his own publisher, London powerhouse John Murray, who agreed to take on The Sketch Book.[37] From then on, Irving would publish concurrently in the United States and Britain to protect his copyright, with Murray as his English publisher of choice.[38]\\nIrving\\'s reputation soared, and for the next two years, he led an active social life in Paris and Great Britain, where he was often feted as an anomaly of literature: an upstart American who dared to write English well.[39]\\nWith both Irving and publisher John Murray eager to follow up on the success of The Sketch Book, Irving spent much of 1821 traveling in Europe in search of new material, reading widely in Dutch and German folk tales.  Hampered by writer\\'s block—and depressed by the death of his brother William—Irving worked slowly, finally delivering a completed manuscript to Murray in March 1822.  The book, Bracebridge Hall, or The Humorists, A Medley (the location was based loosely on Aston Hall, occupied by members of the Bracebridge family, near his sister\\'s home in Birmingham) was published in June 1822.\\nThe format of Bracebridge was similar to that of The Sketch Book, with Irving, as Crayon, narrating a series of more than 50 loosely connected short stories and essays.  While some reviewers thought Bracebridge to be a lesser imitation of The Sketch Book, the book was well received by readers and critics.[40] \"We have received so much pleasure from this book\", wrote critic Francis Jeffrey in the Edinburgh Review, \"that we think ourselves bound in gratitude... to make a public acknowledgement of it\".[41] Irving was relieved at its reception, which did much to cement his reputation with European readers.\\nStill struggling with writer\\'s block, Irving traveled to Germany, settling in Dresden in the winter of 1822. Here he dazzled the royal family and attached himself to Amelia Foster, an American living in Dresden with her five children.[42] The 39-year-old Irving was particularly attracted to Foster\\'s 18-year-old daughter Emily and vied in frustration for her hand. Emily finally refused his offer of marriage in the spring of 1823.[43]\\nHe returned to Paris and began collaborating with playwright John Howard Payne on translations of French plays for the English stage, with little success. He also learned through Payne that the novelist Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley was romantically interested in him, though Irving never pursued the relationship.[44]\\nIn August 1824, Irving published the collection of essays Tales of a Traveller—including the short story \"The Devil and Tom Walker\"—under his Geoffrey Crayon persona. \"I think there are in it some of the best things I have ever written\", Irving told his sister.[45] But while the book sold respectably, Traveller was dismissed by critics, who panned both Traveller and its author. \"The public have been led to expect better things\", wrote the United States Literary Gazette, while the New-York Mirror pronounced Irving \"overrated\".[46] Hurt and depressed by the book\\'s reception, Irving retreated to Paris where he spent the next year worrying about finances and scribbling down ideas for projects that never materialized.[47]\\nWhile in Paris, Irving received a letter from Alexander Hill Everett on January 30, 1826. Everett, recently the American Minister to Spain, urged Irving to join him in Madrid,[48] noting that a number of manuscripts dealing with the Spanish conquest of the Americas had recently been made public. Irving left for Madrid and enthusiastically began scouring the Spanish archives for colorful material.[49]\\nWith full access to the American consul\\'s massive library of Spanish history, Irving began working on several books at once. The first offspring of this hard work, A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus, was published in January 1828. The book was popular in the United States and in Europe and would have 175 editions published before the end of the century.[50] It was also the first project of Irving\\'s to be published with his own name, instead of a pseudonym, on the title page.[51] Irving was invited to stay at the palace of the Duke of Gor, who gave him unfettered access to his library containing many medieval manuscripts.[52] Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada was published a year later,[53] followed by Voyages and Discoveries of the Companions of Columbus in 1831.[54]\\nIrving\\'s writings on Columbus are a mixture of history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works is the source of the durable myth that medieval Europeans believed the Earth was flat.[55] According to the popular book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.[56]\\nIn 1829, Irving was elected to the American Philosophical Society.[57] That same year, he moved into Granada\\'s ancient palace Alhambra, \"determined to linger here\", he said, \"until I get some writings under way connected with the place\".[58] Before he could get any significant writing underway, however, he was notified of his appointment as Secretary to the American Legation in London. Worried he would disappoint friends and family if he refused the position, Irving left Spain for England in July 1829.[59]\\nArriving in London, Irving joined the staff of American Minister Louis McLane. McLane immediately assigned the daily secretary work to another man and tapped Irving to fill the role of aide-de-camp.  The two worked over the next year to negotiate a trade agreement between the United States and the British West Indies, finally reaching a deal in August 1830. That same year, Irving was awarded a medal by the Royal Society of Literature, followed by an honorary doctorate of civil law from Oxford in 1831.[60]\\nFollowing McLane\\'s recall to the United States in 1831 to serve as Secretary of Treasury, Irving stayed on as the legation\\'s chargé d\\'affaires until the arrival of Martin Van Buren, President Andrew Jackson\\'s nominee for British Minister. With Van Buren in place, Irving resigned his post to concentrate on writing, eventually completing Tales of the Alhambra, which would be published concurrently in the United States and England in 1832.[61]\\nIrving was still in London when Van Buren received word that the United States Senate had refused to confirm him as the new Minister. Consoling Van Buren, Irving predicted that the Senate\\'s partisan move would backfire. \"I should not be surprised\", Irving said, \"if this vote of the Senate goes far toward elevating him to the presidential chair\".[62]\\nIrving arrived in New York on May 21, 1832, after 17 years abroad. That September, he accompanied Commissioner on Indian Affairs Henry Leavitt Ellsworth on a surveying mission, along with companions Charles La Trobe[63] and Count Albert-Alexandre de Pourtales, and they traveled deep into Indian Territory (now the state of Oklahoma).[64]  At the completion of his western tour, Irving traveled through Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, where he became acquainted with politician and novelist John Pendleton Kennedy.[65]\\nIrving was frustrated by bad investments, so he turned to writing to generate additional income, beginning with A Tour on the Prairies which related his recent travels on the frontier. The book was another popular success and also the first book written and published by Irving in the United States since A History of New York in 1809.[66]  In 1834, he was approached by fur magnate John Jacob Astor, who convinced him to write a history of his fur trading colony in Astoria, Oregon. Irving made quick work of Astor\\'s project, shipping the fawning biographical account Astoria in February 1836.[67] In 1835, Irving, Astor, and a few others founded the Saint Nicholas Society in the City of New York.\\nDuring an extended stay at Astor\\'s home, Irving met explorer Benjamin Bonneville and was intrigued with his maps and stories of the territories beyond the Rocky Mountains.[68] The two men met in Washington, D.C., several months later, and Bonneville sold his maps and rough notes to Irving for $1,000.[69] Irving used these materials as the basis for his 1837 book The Adventures of Captain Bonneville.[70] These three works made up Irving\\'s \"western\" series of books and were written partly as a response to criticism that his time in England and Spain had made him more European than American.[71] Critics such as James Fenimore Cooper and Philip Freneau felt that he had turned his back on his American heritage in favor of English aristocracy.[72] Irving\\'s western books were well received in the United States, particularly A Tour on the Prairies,[73] though British critics accused him of \"book-making\".[74]\\nIn 1835, Irving purchased a \"neglected cottage\" and its surrounding riverfront property in Tarrytown, New York, which he named Sunnyside in 1841.[75] It required constant repair and renovation over the next 20 years, with costs continually escalating, so he reluctantly agreed to become a regular contributor to The Knickerbocker magazine in 1839, writing new essays and short stories under the Knickerbocker and Crayon pseudonyms.[76] He was regularly approached by aspiring young authors for advice or endorsement, including Edgar Allan Poe, who sought Irving\\'s comments on \"William Wilson\" and \"The Fall of the House of Usher\".[77]\\n\\nIn 1837, a lady of Charleston, South Carolina brought to the attention of William Clancy, newly appointed bishop to Demerara, a passage in The Crayon Miscellany, and questioned whether it accurately reflected Catholic teaching or practice. The passage under \"Newstead Abbey\" read:One of the parchment scrolls thus discovered, throws rather an awkward light upon the kind of life led by the friars of Newstead. It is an indulgence granted to them for a certain number of months, in which a plenary pardon is assured in advance for all kinds of crimes, among which, several of the most gross and sensual are specifically mentioned, and the weaknesses of the flesh to which they were prone.[78]Clancy wrote to Irving, who \"promptly aided the investigation into the truth, and promised to correct in future editions the misrepresentation complained of\". Clancy traveled to his new posting by way of England, and bearing a letter of introduction from Irving, stopped at Newstead Abbey and was able to view the document to which Irving had alluded. Upon inspection, Clancy discovered that it was, in fact, not an indulgence issued to the friars from any ecclesiastical authority, but a pardon given by the king to some parties suspected of having broken \"forest laws\". Clancy requested the local pastor to forward his findings to Catholic periodicals in England, and upon publication, send a copy to Irving. Whether this was done is not clear as the disputed text remains in the 1849 edition.[79]\\nIrving also championed America\\'s maturing literature, advocating stronger copyright laws to protect writers from the kind of piracy that had initially plagued The Sketch Book. Writing in the January 1840 issue of Knickerbocker, he openly endorsed copyright legislation pending in Congress.  \"We have a young literature\", he wrote, \"springing up and daily unfolding itself with wonderful energy and luxuriance, which … deserves all its fostering care\". The legislation, however, did not pass at that time.[80]\\nIn 1841, Irving was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.[81] He also began a friendly correspondence with Charles Dickens and hosted Dickens and his wife at Sunnyside during Dickens\\'s American tour in 1842.[82]\\nPresident John Tyler appointed Irving as Minister to Spain in February 1842, after an endorsement from Secretary of State Daniel Webster.[83] Irving wrote, \"It will be a severe trial to absent myself for a time from my dear little Sunnyside, but I shall return to it better enabled to carry it on comfortably\".[84] He hoped that his position as Minister would allow him plenty of time to write, but Spain was in a state of political upheaval during most of his tenure, with a number of warring factions vying for control of the 12-year-old Queen Isabella II.[85] Irving maintained good relations with the various generals and politicians, as control of Spain rotated through Espartero, Bravo, then Narváez. Espartero was then locked in a power struggle with the Spanish Cortes. Irving\\'s official reports on the ensuing civil war and revolution expressed his romantic fascination with the regent as young Queen Isabella\\'s knight protector, He wrote with an anti-republican, undiplomatic bias. Though Espartero, ousted in July 1843, remained a fallen hero in his eyes, Irving began to view Spanish affairs more realistically.[86] However, the politics and warfare were exhausting, and Irving was both homesick and suffering from a crippling skin condition.\\nI am wearied and at times heartsick of the wretched politics of this country…. The last ten or twelve years of my life, passed among sordid speculators in the United States, and political adventurers in Spain, has shewn me so much of the dark side of human nature, that I begin to have painful doubts of my fellow man; and look back with regret to the confiding period of my literary career, when, poor as a rat, but rich in dreams, I beheld the world through the medium of my imagination and was apt to believe men as good as I wished them to be.[87]With the political situation relatively settled in Spain, Irving continued to closely monitor the development of the new government and the fate of Isabella. His official duties as Spanish Minister also involved negotiating American trade interests with Cuba and following the Spanish parliament\\'s debates over the slave trade. He was also pressed into service by Louis McLane, the American Minister to the Court of St. James\\'s in London, to assist in negotiating the Anglo-American disagreement over the Oregon border that newly elected president James K. Polk had vowed to resolve.[88]\\nIrving returned from Spain in September 1846, took up residence at Sunnyside, and began work on an \"Author\\'s Revised Edition\" of his works for publisher George Palmer Putnam. For its publication, Irving had made a deal which guaranteed him 12 percent of the retail price of all copies sold, an agreement that was unprecedented at that time.[89] As he revised his older works for Putnam, he continued to write regularly, publishing biographies of Oliver Goldsmith in 1849 and Islamic prophet Muhammad in 1850. In 1855, he produced Wolfert\\'s Roost, a collection of stories and essays that he had written for The Knickerbocker and other publications,[90] and he began publishing a biography of his namesake George Washington which he expected to be his masterpiece. Five volumes of the biography were published between 1855 and 1859.[91]\\nIrving traveled regularly to Mount Vernon and Washington, D.C., for his research, and struck up friendships with Presidents Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce.[90] He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.[92] He was hired as an executor of John Jacob Astor\\'s estate in 1848 and appointed by Astor\\'s will as first chairman of the Astor Library, a forerunner to the New York Public Library.[93]\\nIrving continued to socialize and keep up with his correspondence well into his seventies, and his fame and popularity continued to soar. \"I don\\'t believe that any man, in any country, has ever had a more affectionate admiration for him than that given to you in America\", wrote Senator William C. Preston in a letter to Irving. \"I believe that we have had but one man who is so much in the popular heart\".[94] By 1859, author Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. noted that Sunnyside had become \"next to Mount Vernon, the best known and most cherished of all the dwellings in our land\".[95]\\nIrving died of a heart attack in his bedroom at Sunnyside on November 28, 1859, age 76—only eight months after completing the final volume of his Washington biography. Legend has it that his last words were: \"Well, I must arrange my pillows for another night. When will this end?\"[96] He was buried under a simple headstone at Sleepy Hollow cemetery on December 1, 1859.[97] Irving and his grave were commemorated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his 1876 poem \"In the Churchyard at Tarrytown\", which concludes with:\\nHow sweet a life was his; how sweet a death!\\nLiving, to wing with mirth the weary hours,\\nOr with romantic tales the heart to cheer;\\nDying, to leave a memory like the breath\\nOf summers full of sunshine and of showers,\\nA grief and gladness in the atmosphere.[98]\\nIrving is largely credited as the first American Man of Letters and the first to earn his living solely by his pen. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow acknowledged Irving\\'s role in promoting American literature in December 1859: \"We feel a just pride in his renown as an author, not forgetting that, to his other claims upon our gratitude, he adds also that of having been the first to win for our country an honourable name and position in the History of Letters\".[99]\\nIrving perfected the American short story[100] and was the first American writer to set his stories firmly in the United States, even as he poached from German or Dutch folklore. He is also generally credited as one of the first to write in the vernacular and without an obligation to presenting morals or being didactic in his short stories, writing stories simply to entertain rather than to enlighten.[101] He also encouraged many would-be writers. As George William Curtis noted, there \"is not a young literary aspirant in the country, who, if he ever personally met Irving, did not hear from him the kindest words of sympathy, regard, and encouragement\".[102]\\nEdgar Allan Poe, on the other hand, felt that Irving should be given credit for being an innovator but that the writing itself was often unsophisticated. \"Irving is much over-rated\", Poe wrote in 1838, \"and a nice distinction might be drawn between his just and his surreptitious and adventitious reputation—between what is due to the pioneer solely, and what to the writer\".[103] A critic for the New-York Mirror wrote: \"No man in the Republic of Letters has been more overrated than Mr. Washington Irving\".[104] Some critics claimed that Irving catered to British sensibilities, and one critic charged that he wrote \"of and for England, rather than his own country\".[105] For instance, American critic John Neal in his 1824–25 critical work American Writers dismissed Irving as a poor copy of Goldsmith.[106]\\nOther critics were more supportive of Irving\\'s style. William Makepeace Thackeray was the first to refer to Irving as the \"ambassador whom the New World of Letters sent to the Old\",[107] a banner picked up by writers and critics throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. \"He is the first of the American humorists, as he is almost the first of the American writers\", wrote critic H.R. Hawless in 1881, \"yet belonging to the New World, there is a quaint Old World flavor about him\".[108] Early critics often had difficulty separating Irving the man from Irving the writer. \"The life of Washington Irving was one of the brightest ever led by an author\", wrote Richard Henry Stoddard, an early Irving biographer.[109] Later critics, however, began to review his writings as all style with no substance. \"The man had no message\", said critic Barrett Wendell.[110]\\nAs a historian, Irving\\'s reputation had fallen out of favor but then gained a resurgence. \"With the advent of \\'scientific\\' history in the generations that followed his, Irving\\'s historical writings lapsed into disregard and disrespect. To late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historians, including John Franklin Jameson, G. P. Gooch, and others, these works were demiromances, worthy at best of veiled condescension. However, more recently several of Irving\\'s histories and biographies have again won praise for their reliability as well as the literary skill with which they were written. Specifically, A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus; Astoria, or Anecdotes of an Enterprise beyond the Rocky Mountains; and Life of George Washington have earned the respect of scholars whose writings on those topics we consider authoritative in our generation: Samuel Eliot Morison, Bernard DeVoto, Douglas Southall Freeman\".[111]\\nIrving popularized the nickname \"Gotham\" for New York City,[112] and he is credited with inventing the expression \"the almighty dollar\". The surname of his fictional Dutch historian Diedrich Knickerbocker is generally associated with New York and New Yorkers, as found in New York\\'s professional basketball team The New York Knickerbockers.\\nOne of Irving\\'s most lasting contributions to American culture is in the way that Americans celebrate Christmas. In his 1812 revisions to A History of New York, he inserted a dream sequence featuring St. Nicholas soaring over treetops in a flying wagon, an invention which others dressed up as Santa Claus. In his five Christmas stories in The Sketch Book, Irving portrayed an idealized celebration of old-fashioned Christmas customs at a quaint English manor which depicted English Christmas festivities that he experienced while staying in England, which had largely been abandoned.[113] He used text from The Vindication of Christmas (London 1652) of old English Christmas traditions,[114] and the book contributed to the revival and reinterpretation of the Christmas holiday in the United States.[115]\\nIrving introduced the erroneous idea that Europeans believed the world to be flat prior to the discovery of the New World in his biography of Christopher Columbus,[116] yet the flat-Earth myth has been taught in schools as fact to many generations of Americans.[117][118] American painter John Quidor based many of his paintings on scenes from the works of Irving about Dutch New York, including such paintings as Ichabod Crane Flying from the Headless Horseman (1828), The Return of Rip Van Winkle (1849), and The Headless Horseman Pursuing Ichabod Crane (1858).[119][120]\\nThe village of Dearman, New York, changed its name to \"Irvington\" in 1854 to honor Washington Irving, who was living in nearby Sunnyside, which is preserved as a museum.[121] Influential residents of the village prevailed upon the Hudson River Railroad, which had reached the village by 1849,[122] to change the name of the train station to \"Irvington\", and the village incorporated as Irvington on April 16, 1872.[123][124][125]\\nThe town of Knickerbocker, Texas, was founded by two of Irving\\'s nephews, who named it in honor of their uncle\\'s literary pseudonym.[126] The city of Irving, Texas, states that it is named for Washington Irving.[127]\\nIrvington, New Jersey is also named after Irving. It was incorporated on March 27, 1874, from parts of Clinton Township (Clinton Township is now part of Newark, New Jersey since 1902).\\nIrving Street in San Francisco is named after him.[128]\\nThe Irving Park neighborhood in Chicago is named for him as well, though the original name of the subdivision was Irvington and then later Irving Park before annexation to Chicago.[129]\\nGibbons Memorial Park, located in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, is located on Irving Cliff, which was named after him.[130]\\nThe Irvington neighborhood in Indianapolis is also one of the many communities named after him.[131]\\nIrving College (1838–1890) in Irving College, Tennessee, was named for Irving.[132]\\nThere is a statue of Irving in Granada, Spain.[133]\\nThe Village of North Tarrytown, New York, changed its name to Sleepy Hollow in 1996 to honor Washington Irving and capitalize on the popularity of the story \"The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow\".[134]\\nWashington Irving Memorial Park and Arboretum, located in Bixby, Oklahoma, is named in honor of Washington Irving and features an amphitheater stage with a replica façade of his Sunnyside home. The home includes a statue of Irving seated on the porch of the home. Among the tributes to Irving are memorials to the victims of the Oklahoma City Bombing and the World Trade Center attacks, with a steel beam from the towers on display. The park is also the site of local community events, including the annual Bixby BBQ and Blues festival.[135]\\nDownload coordinates as:\\n Category\\n',\n",
       "  'William Roderick James (June 6, 1892 – September 3, 1942)[1] was a Canadian-American artist and writer of the American West. He is known for writing Smoky the Cowhorse, for which he won the 1927 Newbery Medal,[2] and numerous \"cowboy\" stories for adults and children. His artwork, which predominantly involved cowboy and rodeo scenes, followed \"in the tradition of Charles Russell\",[3] and much of it was used to illustrate his books. In 1992, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.[4]\\nJames was born Joseph Ernest Nephtali Dufault, in 1892 in Saint-Nazaire-d\\'Acton, Quebec, Canada,[1] although later, when he began mythologizing his life and in his autobiography, he claimed he was born in Montana.[5] He accounted for his francophone accent by claiming that after his mother died when he was one (from influenza) and his father when he was four (having been gored by a steer), he was adopted by a fur trader (\"old trapper Jean\" Beaupré, whom he called \"Bopy\" since childhood) whose native language was French. Additionally, Beaupré was not fluent in English.[6]\\nJames settled near the new Franco-Saskatchewan settlement of Val Marie in 1910 and learned to be a  western cowboy. He was taught wrangling by local cowboy Pierre Beaupre, and the two built separate homesteads along the Frenchman River in southwest Saskatchewan. James\\'s property later became part of the Walt Larson ranch, which has been folded into the new Grasslands National Park.\\nJames migrated to the United States, where he assumed the new name \"William Roderick James\". He came to Nevada from Montana in 1914. He was arrested there for cattle rustling and was sentenced to twelve to eighteen months in prison, which he served first in Ely, Nevada, and then at the Nevada State Penitentiary at Carson City.[7] While in prison he concentrated on his drawing and produced pictures that the Ely Record commended with the recommendation that \"with proper training he would soon be able to do first class work.\" At the state penitentiary he used his art in connection with his parole application, making a sketch entitled \"A Turning Point\", with the note: \"Have had ample time for serious thought and it is my ambition to follow up on my art.\"[3]\\nAccording to cowboy and folksinger Ian Tyson, James traveled to San Francisco to sell sketches and began working as a stuntman in western movies there.[8] Soon he was in the U.S. Army, serving from 1918 to 1919. It was after his discharge that he began artwork in earnest. He returned to Nevada, arriving in Reno in July in time for the First Annual Nevada Round-Up in Reno, for which he illustrated the cover of the program and was paid $50.[3] He also worked as a horse wrangler for the round-up.\\nIn Reno, James soon teamed up with two men he knew before the war, Fred Conradt and Elmer Freel, to stage \"broncobusting\" exhibitions. During one of these events, James was thrown from a horse and sustained a severe concussion when he landed headfirst on a railroad track. He convalesced at the Conradt household.[3]\\nJames described his first interest in drawing as a pastime he took up (with stick in dirt or charcoal on the \"rough boards of the bunk-house porch\") to alleviate his boredom during the long stretches when his father was away working under a contract to break horses.[9] His first extended period of concentrated drawing took place while he was in prison. While convalescing at the Conradt home he again took up drawing in earnest. It was there that he decided on a career in art. This decision was encouraged by Conradt\\'s 15-year-old sister Alice.[3]\\nIn 1919 James decided to move to San Francisco to pursue an art career. He enrolled at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco where he took evening classes, while working as a theater ticket-taker by day. In San Francisco he met both Maynard Dixon and Harold Von Schmidt. The three occasionally rode horses together and spent time discussing art.[10] At the end of the year, through Von Schmidt\\'s connections, James was able to sell two series of sketches to Sunset, a West Coast periodical. They both formed a narrative and contained text written by James; they ran in the January and November issues.[11]\\nJames returned to Reno and married the 16-year-old Alice Conradt. The couple then travelled first to Kingman, Arizona, then to Santa Fe, New Mexico, near an artists\\' colony. Ranchers near the colony met James and introduced him to Burton Twitchell, dean of students at Yale University. As a result of the meeting, and with financial assistance by the same ranchers, James enrolled in Yale University the following fall. Alice soon followed but James was ill-suited for academics. The couple, with an introduction from Twitchell, travelled to New York City to sell his work. When Life Magazine declined his work, the couple returned to Reno.[12] They soon moved to a cabin built by Alice\\'s father in Washoe Valley. It was there that James first began writing for publication.[13]\\nIn the fall of 1922 James began writing an article on horse bucking. It came to the attention of Max Perkins who believed the writing revealed \"authentic American vernacular\" and recommended the article for publication in Scribner\\'s Magazine.[14] Scribner\\'s paid $300 for the work \"\"Bucking Horses and Bucking-Horse Riders,\" together with its illustrations, James\\'s first published story.[3] Perkins asked James for more work, and over the years the Scribner\\'s publishing house published twenty books of his over the following twenty years.[15]\\nThe sale of several short stories and books followed, enabling him and his wife to buy a small ranch in Washoe Valley, Nevada, where he wrote his most famous book, Smoky the Cowhorse. It was published in 1926 and won the Newbery Medal for children\\'s literature in 1927. Several film adaptations were made of the book, with James narrating the 1933 film. His fictionalized autobiography, Lone Cowboy, was written in 1930 and was a bestselling Book-of-the-Month Club selection. He wrote his last book, The American Cowboy, in 1942, shortly before his death and the last line he wrote was \"The cowboy will never die.\" In all, he wrote and illustrated 23 books, 5 of which were made into feature films.\\nHis later years were spent on his ranch at Pryor Creek, Montana and at his Billings home on Smoky Lane. In the late 1930s he lived in the California high desert on the Godshall C Bar G Ranch. The ranch overlooked the Mojave River and is now within the boundaries of the town of Apple Valley, California. While on the ranch he wrote at least one book, Flint Spears.  He died of alcoholism in Hollywood, California, in 1942.[1]\\nThe largest public collection of James\\' writings, artwork, and personal effects is preserved at the Yellowstone Art Museum in Billings, Montana.\\nIn 1988, the Canadian National Film Board sponsored an 83-minute biography, Alias Will James, which commemorates the French Canadian\\'s life and features his art and storycraft.[8] Folk singer Ian Tyson wrote \"The Man They Called Will James\" for the score and it became a minor hit for Tyson.\\nJames was inducted into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame in 1991,[1] and into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in 1992, on the hundredth anniversary of his birth.[16]\\nJames is an uncle to journalist Pierre Dufault and a grand uncle to singer Luce Dufault.[17]\\n',\n",

After the war, she produced some of her better-known Western stories. Three of these were made into notable films, namely A Man Called Horse (1970) starring Richard Harris, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) starring John Wayne and James Stewart, and The Hanging Tree (1959) starring Gary Cooper.[3][6]\\nBetween 1956 and 1960, Johnson taught creative writing at the University of Montana, from which she had graduated in 1928. Before and during her tenure, she wrote numerous articles and fictional stories for many different magazines. These were often based on interviews with Western old-timers, Native Americans, and characters she met during her tenure as secretary and researcher for the Montana Historical Society. She was also secretary/manager of the Montana Press Association in the 1950s.\\nIn 1957, the Western Writers of America gave her its highest award, the Spur Award, for \"Lost Sister\", a short story in The Hanging Tree collection, that deals with the reintegration into white settler society of Cynthia Ann Parker, who had been kidnapped by Comanche as a child. In 1959, she was made an honorary member of the Blackfoot Tribe. In 1976, she was awarded the Levi Strauss Golden Saddleman Award for bringing dignity and honor to the history and legends of the West.

       "  'Edward Zane Carroll Judson Sr. a.k.a. Ned Buntline (March 20, 1821 – July 16, 1886), was an American publisher, journalist, and writer.\\nJudson was born on March 20, 1821 in Harpersfield, New York.[Note 1] He moved with his parents to Bethany, Pennsylvania in 1826, then to Philadelphia in 1834. His father Levi Carroll Judson was a lawyer and wanted his son to be a clergyman.[2][3]\\nIn November 1834, Judson ran away to sea as a soldier, and the next year he shipped on board a Navy vessel. A number of years later, he rescued the crew of a boat that had been run down by a Fulton Ferry in New York\\'s East River. As a result, he received a commission as a midshipman in the Navy from President Martin Van Buren on February 10, 1838, and he was assigned to the USS Levant. He later served on the USS Constellation and the USS Boston.[1]\\nAs a seaman, he served in the Seminole Wars, but he saw little combat, and he resigned after four years. During the Civil War, he enlisted in the First New York Mounted Rifles and rose to the rank of sergeant before he was dishonorably discharged for drunkenness.[4]\\nJudson\\'s first publication was an adventure story in The Knickerbocker in 1838. He spent several years in the East starting up newspapers and story papers, only to have most of them fail. An early success that helped launch his fame was The Mysteries and Miseries of New York, a gritty serial story of the Bowery and slums of New York City. He was an opinionated man and strongly advocated nativism and temperance; he also became a leader in the Know Nothing movement. In 1844, he adopted the pen name \"Ned Buntline\". \"Buntline\" is the nautical term for a rope at the bottom of a square sail.[4]\\nIn 1841, Buntline\\'s father, Levi Carroll Judson, his wife, and his daughter moved to Pittsburgh, where Levi set up a law practice and his wife and daughter Irene opened a select school in the basement of the First Baptist Church. Here, the Judson and Allen families became acquainted. Rebecca Allen and Irene Judson were teaching at the time and became social friends. Through this connection, William and George Allen, Rebecca\\'s brothers, became friends with Buntline when he arrived in Pittsburgh in December 1843, ostensibly to study law with his father, but in reality to start a literary magazine. Buntline published just two issues of Ned Buntline\\'s Magazine in Pittsburgh in 1844 before it failed.[5]\\nWilliam and George were a co-owners of the steamboat Cicero and they invited Ned to go along on a January 1844 voyage to Cincinnati. On this cruise, Buntline told the Allen brothers of his recent marriage in St. Augustine, Florida, to Seberina Escudero, whom he described to the two brothers in glowing terms. Escudero joined her husband in Pittsburgh in May 1844. In August 1844, Buntline and Escudero relocated to Cincinnati, where Ned partnered with Lucius Hine and Hudson Kidd in an effort to purchase the Western Literary Journal. This magazine also failed.[5]\\nEstranged from his family and in financial straits, Buntline borrowed money from the Allen brothers and pawned his wife\\'s jewelry to meet living expenses. In October, William Allen hired Buntline as a hand on his steamboat, where Ned accepted a counterfeit $10 note and lost a barrel of whiskey. While her husband was steam-boating, Escudero was sewing shirts in Cincinnati for 12 1/2 cents each. In October 1844, the Knickerbocker published an article of Ned\\'s titled \"Running the Blockade\" in which the hero of the story was William Allen. In January 1845 with the assistance of the Allen brothers, Buntline relocated to Nashville, where Hudson Kidd secured temporary living quarters for Escudero while her husband went off to St. Louis for a time. By January 1846, she was living in the Gower House in Smithland, Kentucky.[6][7]\\nBuntline started a third magazine, Buntline\\'s Own, at this time. It was usually said to have been published in Nashville, but the Allen brothers\\' journals suggest that the early issues at least were printed in Smithland. George Allen\\'s journal of January 25, 1846, said that upon his return to Smithland, he went to visit Escudero and learned that she had died there days earlier. William Allen later stated she was buried in Smithland.[6]\\nIn 1845, his Cincinnati venture, Western Literary Journal and Monthly Magazine, was facing bankruptcy, and he fled from Ohio. In Eddyville, Kentucky, he collected a $600 bounty for single-handedly capturing two murderers. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and used the money to start a magazine, Ned Buntline\\'s Own.[4]\\nJudson had a romance with the teenaged wife of Robert Porterfield in Nashville in 1846. On 14 March 1846, Porterfield challenged Judson to a duel, and Judson killed him. At his trial for murder, Judson was shot and wounded by Porterfield\\'s brother, and during the chaos, escaped from custody. He was subsequently captured by a lynch mob and hanged from an awning, but was rescued by friends. A Tennessee grand jury refused to indict him for murder.[4]\\nIn 1847, the Boston publisher and dime-novel author Maturin Murray Ballou paid Judson $100 to write The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main: or, The Fiend of Blood, a melodramatic and violent pirate novel. This was followed the same year with The Red Revenger; Or, The Pirate King of the Floridas. Buntline moved Ned Buntline\\'s Own to New York City in 1848.[4][8][9]\\nThrough his columns and his association with New York City\\'s notorious gangs of the early 19th century, Buntline was one of the instigators of the Astor Place Riot, which left 23 people dead. He was fined $250 and sentenced to a year\\'s imprisonment in September 1849.[10]\\nAfter his release, he devoted himself to writing sensational stories for weekly newspapers, and his income purportedly amounted to $20,000 a year. In 1852 he was involved in a nativist riot in St. Louis, while he was a member of the Know Nothing Party. He eluded the authorities but was arrested in 1872 while touring and promoting his play in the city.[5]\\nAlthough a heavy drinker, he traveled around the country giving lectures about temperance. He was an ardent Republican until the election of 1884, when he refused to support James G. Blaine. On one of his temperance lecture tours, he met William F. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody.[4]\\nBuntline was traveling through Nebraska when he heard that Wild Bill Hickok was in Fort McPherson. Buntline had read a popular article about Hickok and hoped to interview him and write a dime novel about him. He found Hickok in a saloon and rushed up to him, saying, \"There\\'s my man! I want you!\" By this time in his life, Hickok had an aversion to surprises. He threatened Buntline with a gun and ordered him out of town in 24 hours. Buntline took him at his word and left the saloon. Still looking to get information on his subject, Buntline took to finding Hickok\\'s friends. This is likely how he first met Buffalo Bill.[11]\\nBuntline took a train in 1869 from California to Nebraska, where he had been lecturing on the virtues of temperance. There, he met William Cody, who was with a group of men who had recently participated in a battle against the Sioux and Cheyenne.[12]\\nTraveling with the gregarious Cody, Buntline became friends with him and later claimed that he created the nickname \"Buffalo Bill\" for the hero of his serial novel Buffalo Bill, the King of the Border Men, published in the New York Weekly beginning 23 December 1869.[13][12]\\nOriginally, Buntline was going to cast Cody as a sidekick of \"Wild Bill\" Hickok, but he found Cody\\'s character more interesting than Hickok\\'s. Buntline presented Cody as a \"compendium of cliches\"; however, this did not stop the New York playwright Frank Meader from using Buntline\\'s novel as the basis of a play about Cody\\'s life in 1872. In the same year, Buntline and James Gordon Bennett Jr. invited Cody to New York City, where Cody saw the play at the Bowery Theater. In December of that year, Buntline also wrote a Buffalo Bill play, Scouts of the Prairie, which was performed by Cody himself, Texas Jack Omohundro, the Italian ballerina Giuseppina Morlacchi, and Buntline.[14]\\nFor some time, 6-year-old Carlos Montezuma also was featured in the show as \"Atzeka, the Apache-child of Cochise\", being the only genuine American Indian on stage, while his adoptive father, the Italian photographer Carlo Gentile, was hired to produce and sell promotional cartes de visite of the cast members.[15]\\nCody at first was a reluctant actor, but came to enjoy the spotlight. Scouts of the Prairie opened in Chicago in December 1872 and starred Cody. It was panned by critics, but was a success nonetheless. It was performed to packed theaters across the country for years. Cody served as a scout for the Army in the summer; when campaigning stopped for the winter, he would head to the stage. Buntline\\'s play served as training for Cody\\'s later Wild West show.[14]\\nBuntline continued to write dime novels, but none was as successful as his earlier work. Later in life, he embellished his military career, claiming to have been chief of scouts in the Indian Wars with the rank of colonel, and to have received 20 wounds in battle. He also used these pseudonyms: Captain Hal Decker, Scout Jack Ford, and Edward Minturn.  He settled into his home in Stamford, New York, where he died of congestive heart failure on July 18, 1886.  He was once one of the wealthiest authors in America, but his wife had to sell his home the \"Eagle\\'s Nest\" to pay his debts.\\nBuntline\\'s novels may have had unintended consequences. Some readers became thrilled with the exploits of western outlaws, and the novels glamorized crime in their eyes. Female bandits Little Britches and Cattle Annie, for instance, read dime novels, which allegedly aroused their interest in the Bill Doolin gang and may have propelled them into a life of crime.[16]\\nStuart N. Lake wrote in Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal (1931) that Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Bill Tilghman, Charlie Bassett, and Neal Brown each received a Colt Single Action Army revolver as a gift from Buntline in thanks for their help in contributing local color to his Western yarns.[17] The revolvers were said to be chambered in .45 Colt with 12-inch barrels, removable shoulder stocks, standard sights, and wooden grips into which the name \"Ned\" was ornately carved. These revolvers came to be known collectively as the Buntline Special. According to Lake, Earp kept his at the original 12-inch length, but the four other recipients cut their barrels down to 7½ inches. Modern researchers have not found any evidence in secondary sources or primary documents of the guns\\' existence prior to the publication of Lake\\'s book.[18]\\nLake expended much effort trying to track these guns through the Colt company, Masterson, and Earp\\'s contacts in Alaska. Researchers have not found any record of an order received by Colt, and Buntline\\'s alleged connection with Earp has been largely discredited by William B. Shillinberg, who presented a detailed case to confute the Buntline Special legend.[5]\\nMassad Ayoob stated in Greatest Handguns of the World that \"historians debate whether Wyatt Earp owned a \\'Buntline Special\\' (author is inclined to believe that he did), but Colt manufactured many in the latter half of the 20th century\".[19]\\nDick Elliott played \"Major Ned Buntline\" in the 1935 film Annie Oakley with Barbara Stanwyck in the title role.[20] Thomas Mitchell played him in the 1944 film Buffalo Bill.[21] Lloyd Corrigan played him in six episodes of the ABC Western series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp from 1955 to 1958.[22] Burt Lancaster played him (referred to as \"the Legend Maker\") in Robert Altman\\'s 1976 film Buffalo Bill and the Indians.[23]\\n',\n",

He wrote articles documenting the Marines in World War II as a combat correspondent.  He wrote novels, most of which were westerns, but also wrote science fiction.  And, as television became ever-present in American culture, Germano wrote numerous television scripts for western, science-fiction, drama, and cartoon series.\\nGermano was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the eldest of six children. His parents, Italian immigrants from the town of Cigliano, gave him the name Pietro Baptisto Germano, which became Peter B. early in his life. As a young man, he worked several jobs, including as a clerk for the local railroad. It was during his employment at the local train station that he met his wife, Muriel Garant. She was an actress and model, who worked in theater in Cape Cod, but took a job at the railroad station in New Bedford, Massachusetts during World War II. The couple married in February 1943, just before Germano left to serve in the Pacific Theater in World War II. He had a few short stories published in magazines before his tour of duty.[1]\\nAs a war correspondent for the United States Marine Corps, Germano wrote numerous articles that appeared in various newspapers. After the war Peter and Muriel lived in Chicago until he was called to serve in the Korean War in 1950. A few years later, the family settled in Anaheim, California (within walking distance to the newly opened Disneyland). Germano and his wife raised four children, while he began a successful writing career.\\nThroughout his career in the military and his work as a writer, Germano went to college to receive two degrees. With only two years of high school, he attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island from 1946-1950. After his service in the Korean War, Germano transferred to Chapman College in Orange, California in 1956 and received a B. A. in 1959. In 1968, he attended Loyola Marymount University, where he earned his Master of Arts in 1970. From 1971-1973, Germano was a part-time lecturer at Loyola Marymount, where he taught Advanced Writing for Film and Television to graduate students.\\nWith his transition from military to civilian life complete, Germano worked tirelessly on the bulk of his fiction career. He wrote western novels under several pseudonyms, and in the 1950s and 1960s wrote television scripts for several western and science fiction programs.[2]\\nWith a steady career, the family moved in 1966 to a new suburban home in Thousand Oaks, California, located north of Los Angeles in Ventura County. By the 1970s, he had published a science fiction novel, mystery short stories, and western short stories for the Jim Hatfield series in \"Texas Rangers\".\\nGermano collaborated with his wife, Muriel, on several projects. In the 1970s, he became the associate editor of The Californian, the newspaper of the Golden State Mobilehome Owners League. When the editor of the newspaper, Thomas Thompson, retired, Germano and his wife took over as editors; a position which they held for eight years. During this same time period, with grandchildren visiting often, the couple wrote scripts for several animated cartoons televisions series, including The Little Prince.\\nA strong supporter of union labor, Germano was a member of the Writers Guild of America, West. He also held memberships to the Western Writers of America (which published \"The Roundup\" out of the University of Texas at El Paso), the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and the Marine Corps Combat Correspondents Association.\\nGermano died in 1983. When not writing, he hiked the golden hills of California. His ashes were spread in the hills near Thousand Oaks.

He graduated from West Point in 1866 and served in the Army during the Indian Wars under George Crook. He was wounded in the arm and head during the Battle of Sunset Pass forcing his retirement from the regular army as a captain in 1879.  During this time he became acquainted with Buffalo Bill Cody. King would later write scripts for several of Cody\\'s silent films. He also served in the Wisconsin National Guard from 1882 until 1897, becoming Adjutant General in 1895.\\nIn the spring of 1885, General King (at that time a captain in the National Guard) was riding in the area of Delafield, Wisconsin after visiting the Cushing homestead on the Bark River (present day Cushing Park) and the parents of the three historic Cushing Brothers. Captain King came upon a man dressed in a bathrobe drilling young men with broomsticks. Watching this futile exercise by toy soldiers, General King began to chuckle. Reverend Sydney T. Smythe asked what was so funny, and the reply was, \"I mean no disrespect, sir, but let me show you how it is done.\" He then proceeded to teach the young men the West Point Manual of Arms. The now Impressed Head Master of the St. Johns Military Academy (now the St. John\\'s Northwestern Military Academy) inquired as to the gentlemen\\'s name. Upon answering, Reverend Smythe shook hands and inquired on the spot of General King\\'s availability.\\nIn 1898, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and sailed to the Philippines during the Spanish–American War. The fighting with Spain was over by the time he arrived, but he assisted in the surrender negotiations.\\nDuring the following Philippine–American War, King was placed in command of the 1st Brigade in Henry W. Lawton\\'s division. He led his brigade during the Battle of Manila and sailed for Santa Cruz with Lawton\\'s division. He was incapacitated by sickness during the Battle of Santa Cruz, but he returned to fight in the following Battle of Pagsanjan. He took part in the final major campaigns before the fighting turned primarily to guerilla warfare.\\nHe returned to the United States and was active in the Wisconsin National Guard and in training troops for World War I. He wrote and edited over 60 books and novels.

In 1925 he explored early Olmec sites in Mexico, and later studied additional sites in Central America and the American Southwest. In addition to more than 15 scholarly works, mostly about Native Americans, he wrote several novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning Laughing Boy (1929). La Farge also wrote and published short stories, in magazines such as The New Yorker and Esquire.\\nHis more notable works, both fiction and non-fiction, emphasize Native American culture. He was most familiar with the Navajo people, had a speaking knowledge of their language, and was nicknamed by them \\'Anast\\'harzi Nez\\', i.e. \"Tall Cliff-Dweller\".\\nOliver La Farge was born in New York City but grew up in Newport, Rhode Island. He was the son of Christopher Grant La Farge, a noted Beaux-Arts architect, and Florence Bayard Lockwood. His older brother Christopher La Farge became a writer and was a novelist. La Farge and his paternal uncle, architect Oliver H.P. La Farge, were both named for their great-great-grandfather Oliver Hazard Perry.\\nLa Farge received both his Bachelor of Arts degree (1924) and his master\\'s degree (1929) from Harvard University.\\nLa Farge worked as a writer and an anthropologist. In 1925, he traveled with the Danish archeologist Frans Blom, who taught at Tulane University, to what is now known as the Olmec heartland. He (re)discovered San Martin Pajapan Monument 1 and more importantly the ruins of La Venta, one of the major Olmec centers.[1]\\nLa Farge devoted considerable study to Native American peoples and issues, especially after moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1933. He became a champion for American Indian rights and was president of the Association on American Indian Affairs for several years.[2]\\nDuring World War II, La Farge served with the U.S. Air Transport Command, ending service with the rank of major. He participated with the Battle for Greenland, commanded by Colonel Bernt Balchen. Balchen, together with Corey Ford and La Farge, wrote War Below Zero: The Battle for Greenland (1944) about the actions to defend Greenland.\\nLa Farge married heiress Wanden Matthews and had two children with her: a son, Oliver Albee La Farge (b. 1931, later known as Peter La Farge and a daughter, Povy.  They moved to Santa Fe in 1933, but Wanden disliked the area, and they eventually divorced in 1937.\\nTheir first son, Oliver Albee, became estranged from his father[why?] and changed his name to Peter La Farge. His son moved to New York City, where he became a well-known folksinger and songwriter in Greenwich Village, performing during the 1950s and 1960s. Some of his more successful songs have Native American themes, including \"As Long as the Grass Shall Grow\", which takes its name from the title of one of his father\\'s books.\\nLa Farge married a second time to Consuelo Otile Baca with whom he had a son, John Pendaries \"Pen\" La Farge. La Farge\\'s non-fiction book Behind the Mountains (1956) is based on his memories of Consuelo\\'s family, the Baca family of New Mexico, who were ranchers in northern New Mexico.

       "  '\\nLouis Dearborn L\\'Amour (/ˈluːi ləˈmʊər/; né LaMoore; March 22, 1908 – June 10, 1988) was an American novelist and short story writer. His books consisted primarily of Western novels, though he called his work \"frontier stories\". His most widely known Western fiction works include Last of the Breed, Hondo, Shalako, and the Sackett series. L\\'Amour also wrote historical fiction (The Walking Drum), science fiction (The Haunted Mesa), non-fiction (Frontier), and poetry and short-story collections. Many of his stories were made into films. His books remain popular and most have gone through multiple printings. At the time of his death, almost all of his 105 existing works (89 novels, 14 short-story collections, and two full-length works of nonfiction) were still in print, and he was \"one of the world\\'s most popular writers\".[1][2]\\nLouis Dearborn LaMoore was born in Jamestown, North Dakota, on March 22, 1908, the seventh child of Emily Dearborn and veterinarian, local politician, and farm equipment broker Louis Charles LaMoore (who had changed the French spelling of the name L\\'Amour). His mother had Irish ancestry, while his father was of French-Canadian descent. His father had arrived in Dakota Territory in 1882. Although the area around Jamestown was mostly farm land, cowboys and livestock often traveled through Jamestown on their way to or from ranches in Montana and the markets to the east. Louis played \"Cowboys and Indians\" in the family barn, which served as his father\\'s veterinary hospital, and spent much of his free time at the local library, the Alfred E. Dickey Free Library, particularly reading the works of 19th-century British historical boys\\' author G. A. Henty. L\\'Amour once said, \"[Henty\\'s works] enabled me to go into school with a great deal of knowledge that even my teachers didn\\'t have about wars and politics.\"[3]\\nAfter a series of bank failures devastated the economy of the upper Midwest, Dr. LaMoore and Emily took to the road. Removing Louis and his adopted brother John from school, they headed south in the winter of 1923. Over the next seven or eight years, they skinned cattle in west Texas, baled hay in the Pecos Valley of New Mexico, worked in the mines of Arizona, California and Nevada, and in the sawmills and lumber camps of the Pacific Northwest. It was in colorful places like these that Louis met a wide variety of people, upon whom he later modeled the characters in his novels, many of them actual Old West personalities who had survived into the 1920s and 1930s.\\nMaking his way as a mine assessment worker, professional boxer, and merchant seaman, Louis traveled the country and the world, sometimes with his family, sometimes not. He visited all of the western states plus England, Japan, China, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies, Arabia, Egypt, and Panama, finally moving with his parents to Choctaw, Oklahoma in the early 1930s. There, he changed his name to the original French spelling \"L\\'Amour\" and settled down to try to make something of himself as a writer.[4]\\nHe had success with poetry, articles on boxing and writing and editing sections of the WPA Guide Book to Oklahoma, but the dozens of short stories he was churning out met with little acceptance. Finally, L\\'Amour placed a story, Death Westbound, in \"10 Story Book\", a magazine that featured what was supposed to be quality writing (Jack Woodford, author of several books on writing, is published in the same edition as L\\'Amour) alongside scantily attired or completely naked young women. Several years later, L\\'Amour placed his first story for pay, Anything for a Pal, published in True Gang Life. Two lean disappointing years passed after that, and then, in 1938, his stories began appearing in pulp magazines fairly regularly.\\nAlong with other adventure and crime stories, L\\'Amour created the character of mercenary sea captain Jim Mayo. Starting with East of Gorontalo, the series ran through nine episodes from 1940 until 1943. L\\'Amour wrote only one story in the western genre prior to World War II, 1940\\'s The Town No Guns Could Tame.[4]\\nL\\'Amour continued as an itinerant worker, traveling the world as a merchant seaman until the start of World War II. During World War II, he served in the United States Army as a lieutenant with the 362nd Quartermaster Truck Company.  In the two years before L\\'Amour was shipped off to Europe, L\\'Amour wrote stories for Standard Magazine. After World War II, L\\'Amour continued to write stories for magazines; his first after being discharged in 1946 was Law of the Desert Born in Dime Western Magazine (April 1946). L\\'Amour\\'s contact with Leo Margulies led to L\\'Amour agreeing to write many stories for the Western pulp magazines published by Standard Magazines, a substantial portion of which appeared under the name \"Jim Mayo\". The suggestion of L\\'Amour writing Hopalong Cassidy novels also was made by Margulies who planned on launching Hopalong Cassidy\\'s Western Magazine at a time when the William Boyd films and new television series were becoming popular with a new generation. L\\'Amour read the original Hopalong Cassidy novels, written by Clarence E. Mulford, and wrote his novels based on the original character under the name \"Tex Burns\". Only two issues of the Hopalong Cassidy Western Magazine were published, and the novels as written by L\\'Amour were extensively edited to meet Doubleday\\'s thoughts of how the character should be portrayed in print.  Strongly disagreeing—L\\'Amour preferred Mulford\\'s original, much rougher characterization of Cassidy—for the rest of his life he denied authoring the novels.\\nIn the 1950s, L\\'Amour began to sell novels. L\\'Amour\\'s first novel, published under his own name, was Westward The Tide, published by World\\'s Work in 1951. The short story The Gift of Cochise was printed in Colliers (5 July 1952) and seen by John Wayne and Robert Fellows, who purchased the screen rights from L\\'Amour for $4,000. James Edward Grant was hired to write a screenplay based on this story changing the main character\\'s name from Ches Lane to Hondo Lane. L\\'Amour retained the right to novelize the screenplay and did so, even though the screenplay differed substantially from the original story. This was published as Hondo in 1953 and released on the same day the film opened with a blurb from John Wayne stating that \"Hondo was the finest Western Wayne had ever read\". During the remainder of the decade L\\'Amour produced a great number of novels, both under his own name as well as others (e. g. Jim Mayo). Also during this time he rewrote and expanded many of his earlier short story and pulp fiction stories to book length for various publishers.\\nMany publishers in the 1950s and \\'60s refused to publish more than one or two books a year by the same author. Louis\\'s editor at Gold Medal supported his writing up to three or four but the heads of the company vetoed that idea even though Louis was publishing books with other houses. Louis had sold over a dozen novels and several million copies before Bantam Books editor-in-chief Saul David was finally able to convince his company to offer Louis a short term exclusive contract that would accept three books a year. It was only after 1960, however, that Louis\\'s sales at Bantam would begin to surpass his sales at Gold Medal.\\nL\\'Amour\\'s career flourished throughout the 1960s and he began work on a series of novels about the fictional Sackett family. The Daybreakers, published in 1960 and the first, was actually not in the chronological order of the series of novels.[5][circular reference] Initially he wrote five books about William Tell Sackett and his close relatives; however, in later years the series spread to include other families and four centuries of North American history. It was an ambitious project and several stories intended to close the gaps in the family\\'s time line were left untold at the time of L\\'Amour\\'s death. L\\'Amour also branched out into historical fiction with The Walking Drum, set in the 11th century, a contemporary thriller, Last of the Breed, and science fiction with The Haunted Mesa.\\nL\\'Amour eventually wrote 100 novels, over 250 short stories, and (as of 2010) sold more than 320 million copies of his work. By the 1970s his writings were translated into over ten languages. Every one of his works is still in print.[1]\\nMany of the L\\'Amour titles have been produced in the \"single voice\" style.[6] In the early days, however, when the fledgling Bantam Audio Publishing (now Random House Audio) came to L\\'Amour about converting some of his old short stories into audio, he insisted that they do something to offer the audience more value than just having an actor read a bunch of old pulp stories.  Together he and Bantam executive Jenny Frost created the concept of a series of \"Radio Drama\" style productions that would combine a large cast of actors, sound effects and music to produce a modern audio drama of each story.[7]\\nThe team of David Rapkin (Producer) and Charles Potter (Director) was employed to produce a prototype show and L\\'Amour\\'s son Beau came into the program as Supervising Producer. Between 1986 and 2004 the team had completed over sixty-five dramatized audio productions. Several different styles of show were produced over the years. The first several shows were \"transcriptions\", literal breakdowns of the exact L\\'Amour short story into lines for the different characters and narrator. Later productions used more liberally interpreted adaptations written by screenwriters, playwrights and a few film and theater students, who were taught the process by Beau L\\'Amour and the more prolific writers from earlier adaptations.\\nThe majority of productions were done in New York City. In the early years the pace of production was six shows a year but in the mid-1990s it slowed to four. At this time the running time for all the programs was roughly sixty minutes. The cast members were veterans of the New York stage, film and advertising worlds and came together for a rehearsal and then a day of recording the show. Sound effects were created by effects man Arthur Miller in the studio as the lines were being recorded and narration was done.\\nAlthough many of the programs were written and produced in a modified \"Old Time Radio\" style, attempts were also made to modernize the approach. Whenever the story material supported it a more contemporary style was used in the writing and more and more high tech solutions to the effects and mix found their way into the productions. While hiring and supervising the writers, mostly out of Los Angeles, Beau L\\'Amour created a few programs on his own. The techniques used by him and producer/editor Paul O\\'Dell were more in line with motion picture production, simply taping the voices of the actors in the studio and then recording the majority of sound effects in the field. This called for a great deal more editing, both in cutting the actor\\'s performances and the sound effects, but it allowed for a great deal more control.\\nIn the mid-1990s a series of the L\\'Amour Audio Dramas was recut for radio. Louis L\\'Amour Theater[8] played on over two hundred stations for a number of years. Several of the scripts from the L\\'Amour series have been produced as live theater pieces, including The One for the Mojave Kid and Merrano of the Dry Country.\\nThe L\\'Amour program of Audio Dramas is still ongoing but the pace of production has slowed considerably. Beau L\\'Amour and Paul O\\'Dell released Son of a Wanted Man,[9] the first L\\'Amour Drama in half a decade in 2004. Son of a Wanted Man is also the first Louis L\\'Amour novel to be turned into a drama. Considerably more complex than earlier shows it had a cast of over twenty mid-level Hollywood actors, a music score was created by John Philip Shenale[10] and recorded specifically for the production and sound effects completely recorded in the field in many locations across the west. Produced as sort of a \"profitable hobby\" Beau L\\'Amour and Paul O\\'Dell created the production while working around their day-to-day jobs. Since this allowed them no more than nine or ten weeks a year, the show took four years to complete.\\nDuring the 1960s, L\\'Amour intended to build a working town typical of those of the 19th century Western frontier, with buildings with false fronts situated in rows on either side of an unpaved main street and flanked by wide boardwalks before which, at various intervals, were watering troughs and hitching posts. The town, to be named Shalako after the protagonist of L\\'Amour\\'s novel of the same name, was to have featured shops and other businesses that were typical of such towns: a barber shop, a hotel, a dry goods store, one or more saloons, a church, a one-room schoolhouse, etc. It would have offered itself as a filming location for Hollywood motion pictures concerning the Wild West. However, funding for the project fell through, and Shalako was never built.\\nWhen interviewed not long before his death, he was asked which among his books he liked best. His reply:\\nI like them all. There\\'s bits and pieces of books that I think are good. I never rework a book. I\\'d rather use what I\\'ve learned on the next one, and make it a little bit better. The worst of it is that I\\'m no longer a kid and I\\'m just now getting to be a good writer. Just now.[11]The critic Jon Tuska, surveying Western literature, writes:\\nI have no argument that L\\'Amour\\'s total sales have probably surpassed every other author of Western fiction in the history of the genre. Indeed, at the time of his death his sales had topped 200,000,000. What I would question is the degree and extent of his effect \"upon the American Imagination\". His Western fiction is strictly formulary and frequently, although not always, features the ranch romance plot where the hero and the heroine are to marry at the end once the villains have been defeated. Not only is there nothing really new in the basic structure of his stories, even L\\'Amour\\'s social Darwinism, which came to characterize his later fiction, was scarcely original and was never dramatized in other media the way it was in works based on Zane Grey\\'s fiction.[12]But Tuska also notes \"At his best, L\\'Amour was a master of spectacular action and stories with a vivid, propulsive forward motion.\"[13]\\nIn May 1972 he was awarded an Honorary PhD by Jamestown College, as a testament to his literary and social contributions.[14]\\nIn 1979, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[15][16]\\nBendigo Shafter (1979) won the U.S. National Book Award in the one-year category Western.[17]\\nIn 1982 he received the Congressional Gold Medal, and in 1984 President Ronald Reagan awarded L\\'Amour the Presidential Medal of Freedom. L\\'Amour is also a recipient of North Dakota\\'s Roughrider Award and the MPTF Golden Boot Award.\\nL\\'Amour, a non-smoker, died from lung cancer at his home in Los Angeles on June 10, 1988, and was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.[1] His autobiography detailing his years as an itinerant worker in the west, Education of a Wandering Man, was published posthumously in 1989. He was survived by his wife Kathy, their son Beau, and their daughter Angelique.[18]\\n(including series novels)\\n\\n\\nL\\'Amour often wrote series of novels and short stories featuring previously introduced characters, the most notable being the Sackett clan.\\nIn fictional story order (not the order written).[21]\\nThere are also two Sackett-related short stories:\\nSacketts are also involved in the plot of 10 other novels:\\n(Note: The Talon and Chantry series are often combined into one list for a total of eight)[22]\\n[23]\\nOriginally published under the pseudonym \"Tex Burns\". Louis L\\'Amour was commissioned to write four Hopalong Cassidy books in the spring and summer of 1950 by Doubleday\\'s Double D Western imprint. They were the first novels he ever had published and he denied writing them until the day he died, refusing to sign any of them that fans would occasionally bring to his autograph sessions. The reason given to his young son for doing this was, \"I wrote some books. I just did it for the money, and my name didn\\'t go on them. So now, when people ask me if they were mine, I say \\'no.\\'\" When his son asked if this would be a lie, he said, \"I just wrote them for hire. They weren\\'t my books.\"\\n\\n',\n",
       "  'Marcial Lafuente Estefanía (Spanish: [maɾˈθjal laˈfwente estefaˈnia]; (13 June 1903 Toledo-7 August 1984 Madrid) was a prolific Spanish writer of romance and western fiction, widely considered as the leading voice of the latter genre in the Hispanic world.  The most conservative sources estimate he wrote 2,600 books.[1]\\nEventually, his sons, Francisco and Federico and his grandson Francisco, would join the family business by churning out novels under his name.[1][2][3]\\nLafuente Estefanía was born in Toledo in 1903. His father, Federico Lafuente López-Elías, was a lawyer and also an author.[4] He studied industrial engineering and worked in Spain, Angola, South America, and the United States, where he traveled between 1928 and 1931.[1][4] During the Spanish Civil War he would become an artillery general in the Republican army. Upon their defeat, he refused to go into exile, and during the subsequent repression he was incarcerated several times and nearly executed.[1][5]\\nAccording to Lafuente\\'s son, Federico Lafuente Beorlegui (see Spanish naming customs), during the war Lafuente Estefanía met humor novelist and playwright Enrique Jardiel Poncela, who advised him to write stories that would amuse people, as he believed it to be \"the only way to live off writing\". Once released from prison in the early 40s, Lafuente began writing mass-market paperbacks, initially for a small publisher in Vigo.[2] His political allegiances and his imprisonment had made him an outcast under the fascist regime, closing him all doors to any jobs in his own trade: thus mass-market literature became his lifesaver.[3]\\nHis first books were romances, which he published under his wife\\'s name, María Luisa Beorlegui.[4] In 1943 he published his first western, La mascota de la pradera. He would continue to cultivate this genre until his death.[1]\\nIn 1947 and 1948, Lafuente Estefanía and several other western authors, many of them liberal professionals like him now forced to resort to pulp literature for survival, were attracted toward Spanish publisher Bruguera.  Among them were Silver Kane (pen name of lawyer Francisco González Ledesma) or Keith Luger (Miguel Oliveros Touan).[5] At the time, Bruguera was building an empire of popular literature spanning the whole Hispanic world, cemented on mass-market paperbacks and comic-books; Francisco Ibáñez, of Mortadelo y Filemón fame, and M.L. Estefanía became Bruguera\\'s star names.[2]\\nAccording to Silver Kane, Bruguera\\'s guidelines were very strict; novels had to be catchy from page one, and there was heavy censorship. It was frequent to turn in a completed manuscript (around a hundred pages) every week. Given these limitations, Silver Kane said he was often surprised by how good the novels were.[5]\\nLafuente Estefanía\\'s novels became the readers\\' favorites. They had a deep impact in the pop culture of Spain, Latin America and the Southern United States in the 50s and 60s. First printings of 30,000 copies were frequent.[1] In the golden years of the format (late 50s and early 60s) printings reached 100,000 copies.[2]  Lafuente\\'s creative process often involved adapting popular dramas into typical Far West settings and stock characters.[1] He was also unique among other Spanish western authors in that he had visited the American west he was writing about.\\nLafuente Estefanía died on August 7, 1984, in Madrid. His sons and later a grandson continued to write novels under the same name, still published by Ediciones B (Bruguera\\'s rebranded name after its acquisition by Grupo Zeta). Adding all hands behind it, the house name \"M.L. Estefanía\" is estimated to have sold fifty million books as of 2007.[2]\\nIn an interview in 2008, Federico Lafuente Beorlegui, last surviving son of Marcial, explained he continued to write one novel a week, now released under the family\\'s own imprint, Cíes. According to him, the Latino population of the U.S. are currently the biggest consumers of Spanish westerns.[6]\\n',\n",

Kennedy battling a soul-sucking Egyptian mummy in a nursing home (the plot of his Bram Stoker Award-nominated novella, Bubba Ho-Tep, which was made into a movie by Don Coscarelli).[5]\\nHis Hap and Leonard series of twelve novels, four novellas, and three short story collections feature Hap Collins and Leonard Pine who live in the fictional town of Laborde, in East Texas, where they find themselves solving a variety of crimes.[5] Hap is a white working class laborer in his mid forties who once protested against the war in Vietnam and spent time in federal prison rather than be drafted, and Leonard is a gay black Vietnam vet. Both of them are accomplished fighters. The stories (told from Hap\\'s point of view) are violent, and characterized by strong language and sexual situations. Lansdale depiction of East Texas is essentially \"good\" but blighted by racism, ignorance, urban and rural deprivation and corrupt public officials. His novels are also characterized by sharp humor and \"wisecracking\" dialogue.[6] These books have been adapted into a TV series for the SundanceTV channel[7] and a series of graphic novels in 2017.[8] Season 2 is based on the second Hap and Leonard novel Mucho Mojo and season 3, which premiered on 3/7/18, is based on the third novel The Two-Bear Mambo.[9]\\nMuch of Lansdale\\'s work has been issued and re-issued as limited editions by Subterranean Press[10] and as trade paperbacks by Vintage Crime/Black Lizard Publications.[11]\\nLansdale\\'s novel titled Fender Lizards was published in November 2015 by Subterranean Press.[12] In February 2016 two full-length novels Hell\\'s Bounty was published Feb 27 also by Subterreanean Press[13] and a new Hap and Leonard novel titled Honky Tonk Samurai was released Feb 2 by Mulholland Books.[14] On January 31, 2017 Coco Butternut: A Hap and Leonard Novella was released by Subterranean Press[15] and Rusty Puppy was released by Mulholland Books February 21, 2017.[16] A new mosaic novel titled Blood and Lemonade was released on March 14, 2017.[17]\\nLansdale and daughter Kasey started a new publishing company called Pandi Press to control the re-issue and publication of his older works.[18]\\nLansdale book of essays and memoirs, Miracles Ain\\'t What They Used To Be, was released by PM Press\\'s Outspoken Author Series.[19] His newest Hap and Leonard release is a novel titled Jackrabbit Smile and released March 27, 2018.[20] He also, along with his daughter Kasey, released a collection of Dana Roberts mysteries titled Terror is Our Business: Dana Roberts\\' Casebook of Horrors, published in May 2018 by Cutting Block Books.[21] In October 2018 a short story collection titled Driving to Geronimo\\'s Grave and Other Stories has been published by Subterranean Press as a limited edition.

       "  '\\nElmore John Leonard Jr. (October 11, 1925\\xa0– August 20, 2013) was an American novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter. His earliest novels, published in the 1950s, were Westerns, but he went on to specialize in crime fiction and suspense thrillers, many of which have been adapted into motion pictures. Among his best-known works are Hombre, Swag, City Primeval, LaBrava, Glitz, Freaky Deaky, Get Shorty, Rum Punch, Out of Sight and Tishomingo Blues.\\nLeonard\\'s short story \"Three-Ten to Yuma\" was adapted as 3:10 to Yuma, which was remade in 2007. Rum Punch was adapted as the Quentin Tarantino film Jackie Brown (1997). Steven Soderbergh adapted Out of Sight in 1998 into a film of the same name. Get Shorty was adapted into an eponymous film in 1995, and in 2017 it was adapted into a television series of the same name. His writings were also the basis for The Tall T, as well as the FX television series Justified and Justified: City Primeval. Among other honors, he won the 2009 Pen Lifetime Award[1] and the 2012 Medal For Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.[2][3]\\nAnthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote that Leonard was hailed as one of the best crime writers in the land. High praise, but not quite high enough, and some way off the mark. He was one of the best writers, and he happened to write about crime. Even that is not entirely accurate. It\\'s true that his novels (more than forty of them, with another left unfinished at his death) enjoyed the company of criminals and of those who tried to stop them in their tracks. This was seldom hard, since, as Leonard delighted in showing us, crime—more than anything, even politics—allows men of all ages to disport themselves across the full range of human ineptitude. Boy, do they screw up.[4]Leonard was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Flora Amelia (née Rive) and Elmore John Leonard.[5] Because his father worked as a site locator for General Motors, the family moved frequently for several years. In 1934, the family settled in Detroit. In the 1930s, there were two news items that would influence many of Leonard\\'s works.[6][7] From 1931, until they were killed in May 1934, gangsters Bonnie and Clyde were on a rampage. In 1934, the baseball team the Detroit Tigers made it to the World Series, winning the Series in 1935. Leonard developed lifelong fascinations with sports and crime. He graduated from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School in 1943 and, after being rejected for the Marines for weak eyesight, immediately joined the Navy, where he served with the Seabees for three years in the South Pacific, where he earned the nickname \"Dutch\", after Tigers pitcher Dutch Leonard.[8] Enrolling at the University of Detroit in 1946, he pursued writing more seriously, entering short stories in contests and submitting then to magazines for publication. He graduated in 1950[9] with a bachelor\\'s degree in English and philosophy. A year before he graduated, he got a job as a copy writer with Campbell-Ewald Advertising Agency, a position he kept for several years, writing on the side.[9]\\nLeonard had his first success in 1951 when Argosy magazine published his short story \"Trail of the Apaches\".[10]:\\u200a29\\u200a During the 1950s and early \\'60s, he continued writing Westerns, publishing more than 30 short stories. His debut novel, The Bounty Hunters, was published in 1953 and was followed by four more Westerns. His early work already showed his affection for outsiders and underdogs. He developed his characters through dialogue, each defined by their manner of speech. In many stories, he favored Arizona and New Mexico as settings.[11] Five of his westerns were adapted as movies before 1972: The Tall T (1957), 3:10 to Yuma (1957), Hombre (1967), Valdez Is Coming (1971), and Joe Kidd (1972).\\nIn 1969, his first crime story, The Big Bounce, was published by Gold Medal Books. Leonard differed from well-known names writing in this genre\\u2060—he was less interested in melodrama than in his characters and in realistic dialogue. He wrote the screenplay for, and the novelization of, Mr. Majestyk (both 1974); Anthony Lane called the latter \"the best novel ever written about a melon grower.\"[4] The stories were often located in Detroit but he also liked to use South Florida as a setting. LaBrava, a 1983 novel set in the latter locale, was praised in a New York Times review, which said Leonard moved from mystery suspense short story writer to novelist.[12] His next novel, Glitz (1985), an Atlantic City gambling story, was his breakout in the crime genre. It spent 16 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, and his subsequent crime novels were all bestsellers.[13][14] In his review of Glitz, Stephen King placed Leonard in the company of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and John D. MacDonald.[15] \\nLeonard believed that his books during the 1980s were becoming funnier and that he was developing a style that was more free and easy. His own favorites were Freaky Deaky (1988), about ex-hippie criminals and the Dixie Mafia story Tishomingo Blues (2002).[16]\\nSome of Leonard\\'s characters appear in several novels, including mobster Chili Palmer, bank robber Jack Foley and the U. S. Marshals Carl Webster and Raylan Givens.[17][18]\\nAt the time of his death his novels had sold tens of millions of copies.[19]\\nAmong film adaptations of his work are Jackie Brown, (1997), based on Rum Punch and described as an \"homage to the author\\'s trademark rhythm and pace\";[19] Get Shorty (1995); Out of Sight (1998) and the TV series Justified (2010—2015) and Justified: City Primeval (2023—).[20] Nearly thirty movies were made from Leonard\\'s novels, but for some critics his special style worked best in print.[4]\\nHe married Beverly Clare Cline in 1949, and they had five children together—two daughters and three sons[21]—before divorcing in 1977. His second marriage in 1979, to Joan Leanne Lancaster (aka Joan Shepard), ended with her death in 1993. Later that same year, he married Christine Kent and they divorced in 2012.[22][23] Leonard spent the last years of his life with his family in Oakland County, Michigan. He suffered a stroke on July 29, 2013. Initial reports stated that he was recovering,[24] but on August 20, 2013, Leonard died at his home in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills of stroke complications.[25] He was 87 years old.[22][23] One of Leonard\\'s grandchildren is Alex Leonard, the drummer in the Detroit band Protomartyr.[26]\\nCommended by critics for his gritty realism and strong dialogue, Leonard sometimes took liberties with grammar in the interest of speeding the story along.[27] In his essay \"Elmore Leonard\\'s Ten Rules of Writing\" he said: \"My most important rule is one that sums up the 10: If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it.\" He also said: \"I try to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip.\"[27]\\nLeonard has been called \"the Dickens of Detroit\" because of his intimate portraits of people from that city, though he said, \"If I lived in Buffalo, I\\'d write about Buffalo.\"[10]:\\u200a90\\u200a His favorite epithet was given to him by Britain\\'s New Musical Express: \"the poet laureate of wild assholes with revolvers\".[28] His ear for dialogue has been praised by writers such as Saul Bellow and Martin Amis. \"Your prose makes Raymond Chandler look clumsy,\" Amis told Leonard at a Writers Guild event in Beverly Hills in 1998.[29] Stephen King called Leonard \"the great American writer.\"[30] According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, Leonard\\'s mastery of free indirect discourse, a third-person narrative technique that gives the illusion of immediate access to a character\\'s thoughts, \"is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, and Hemingway in the mix.\"[31]\\nLeonard often cited Hemingway as his most important influence, but also criticized his lack of humor.[32] Still, it was Leonard\\'s affection for Hemingway, and for George V. Higgins, that led him to will his personal papers to the University of South Carolina, where many of Hemingway\\'s and Higgins\\' papers are archived. Leonard\\'s papers reside at the university\\'s Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections.[33][34] John Steinbeck was another influence.[citation needed]\\nLeonard in turn had a very strong influence on a generation of crime writers that followed him, among them George Pelecanos, Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, and Laura Lippman.[35]\\n\\nAnthony Lane praised Leonard\\'s ear for dialogue, comparing him to Dickens and Evelyn Waugh: \"Leonard can make do with a single letter, or a blank where a letter is meant to be. \\'What in the hell\\'s a Albanian?,\\' a guy named Clement asks in Chapter 4 of City Primeval (1980). Typesetters may have pounced upon what they took to be a typo, but Leonard never misheard. In that respect, as in others, he was less like Hemingway—of whom he was a fan, and to whom he was often compared—than like Dickens, another city kid with his nose and ear to the ground... One proof of literary genius, we might say, is a democratic generosity toward your mother tongue—the conviction that every part or particle of speech, be it e\\'er so humble, can be put to fruitful use...\\nHe is gone now, but he left us a fine consolation: if you\\'ve never read him, or if you\\'d never heard of him until yesterday, or if you merely need a fitting way to mourn, pick up 52 Pick-Up, LaBrava, Swag, or Glitz, and tune into the voices of America—calling loud and clear, and largely ungrammatical, from Atlantic City, Miami, Hollywood, and his home turf of Detroit. Elmore Leonard got them right, and did them proud. As Clement would say, he was a author.\"[4]Leonard has been anthologized by the Library of America in four volumes: Westerns (Last Stand at Saber River, Hombre, Valdez is Coming, Forty Lashes Less One and eight short stories); Four Novels of the 1970s (Fifty-Two Pickup, Swag, Unknown Man No. 89, The Switch); Four Novels of the 1980s (City Primeval, LaBrava, Glitz, Freaky Deaky) and Four Later Novels (Get Shorty, Rum Punch, Out of Sight, Tishomingo Blues and the short story \"Karen Makes Out\".)[40]\\nLeonard also contributed one chapter (the twelfth of thirteen) to the 1996 Miami Herald parody serial novel Naked Came the Manatee (ISBN\\xa00-449-00124-5).\\nNearly all of Leonard\\'s novels have been performed as audiobooks. A number of them (including The Big Bounce, Be Cool and The Tonto Woman) have been recorded more than once resulting in over 60 English-language audiobook versions of his novels.[42] Many of the earlier recordings were abridgements, the last of which was Pagan Babies (2000) read by Steve Buscemi. Certain narrators have dominated the Elmore Leonard oeuvre, notably Frank Muller (11 audiobooks), Grover Gardner aka Alexander Adams (7), George Guidall (5), Mark Hammer (5), and Joe Mantegna (5). Other notable Leonard narrators include Liev Schreiber, Neil Patrick Harris, Tom Wopat, Arliss Howard, Joe Morton, Taye Diggs, Brian Dennehy, Bruce Boxleitner, Tom Skerritt, Robert Forster, Dylan Baker, Paul Rudd, Keith Carradine, Ed Asner, and Henry Rollins.[42][43]\\nTwenty-six of Leonard\\'s novels and short stories have been adapted for the screen (19 as motion pictures and another seven as television programs).\\nNumerous Leonard novels and short stories have been adapted as films including Get Shorty (1990 novel, 1995 film), Out of Sight (1996 novel, 1998 film) and Rum Punch (1992 novel, 1997 film Jackie Brown). The novel 52 Pickup was first adapted very loosely into the 1984 film The Ambassador (1984), starring Robert Mitchum and, two years later, under the slightly altered 52 Pick-Up title starring Roy Scheider. Leonard has also written several screenplays based on his novels, plus original screenplays such as Joe Kidd (1972). The film Hombre (1967), starring Paul Newman, was an adaptation of Leonard\\'s 1961 eponymous novel. His short story \"Three-Ten to Yuma\" (March 1953) and novels The Big Bounce (1969) and 52 Pickup (1974) have each been filmed twice.\\nOther novels filmed include:\\nQuentin Tarantino has optioned the right to adapt Leonard\\'s novel Forty Lashes Less One (1972).[44]\\n',\n",

Lott received a citation from the National Institute of Letters and Arts for The Last Hunt, and was granted a Literacy Fellowship Award by Houghton Mifflin to finish the book.[4] The Last Hunt was selected by the Pulitzer fiction jury for the 1955 Pulitzer Prize, but John Hohenberg convinced the Pulitzer board that William Faulkner was long overdue for the award, despite his submitted novel A Fable being a lesser work of his, and the board overrode the jury's selection, much to the disgust of its members.[5] The Last Hunt was made into a 1957 movie.\\n\\nThis article about a fiction writer from the United States is a stub.

       "  'Giles Alfred Lutz (March 1910\\xa0– June 1982) was a prolific author of fiction in the Western genre.  Born in March 1910 in Missouri, United States, Lutz for many years wrote short stories about the American West that were published in pulp magazines.  His story \"Get a Wild Horse Hunter\", an example of his pulp fiction writing, appeared in the June 1952 edition of the magazine Western Novels and Short Stories.  In the mid-1950s Lutz made the transition to full-length novels, and until his death in June 1982, published numerous stories about the American West.  In 1962, Lutz won the Western Writers of America Golden Spur Award for his novel The Honyocker.\\nLutz wrote under several pseudonyms during his pulp fiction career, including under the names: \"James B. Chaffin,\" \"Wade Everett (with Will Cook),\" \"Alex Hawk,\" \"Hunter,\" \"Hunter Ingram,\" \"Reese Sullivan,\" and \"Gene Thompson.\"  Under the pseudonym \"Brad Curtis,\" Lutz wrote steamy pulp novels in the erotica genre.

Three of his books were adapted to film.[1] He was born in Lewiston, New York, and wrote adventure novels set in the American West in the early 20th century.[1] The Chattanooga-Hamilton County Bicentennial Library has a collection of his papers.[2]\\nHis novels were set in the mountains of Colorado, Nevada, and Utah. Railroading and mining provided settings for his storylines. The main characters were often mining or railroad engineers. His collection of detective stories was titled Scientific Sprague.[3] His story Moonshiner of Fact is set in the Appalachian Mountains of Eastern Tennessee.[4]\\nMary Antoinette Stickle Lynde (née Stickle; 1867–1960) was his wife.[1]\\nHe is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery, Chattanooga, Tennessee.[1]\\n',\n",

He attended the University of Montana in Missoula where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and later lived in Helena.\\nIn 1958, Lynde created the comic strip Rick O\\'Shay, a critical and commercial success. Like most of his work, it was set in the West and mixed humor with strong storytelling. After a dispute with the syndicate, Lynde left the strip in 1977. The strip continued, drawn by Alfredo Alcala.[2]\\nIn 1979, Lynde launched another strip, Latigo, starring Cole \"Latigo\" Cantrell, a.k.a. \"Two Trails\". His father was a mountain man and his mother a Crow Indian. After serving in the Union Army during the Civil War, Latigo returned to the West and became a federal marshal. The daily strip was launched on 25 June 1979, joined by a Sunday strip, best seen in the half page format, on 1 July 1979. It was not a great commercial success and ended in 1983, the daily on 7 May, the Sunday on 5 June.\\nFrom 1984 to 1985, Lynde produced the weekly panel Grass Roots, which was revived in 1998. In the late 1980s, the Swedish financial newspaper Dagens Industri commissioned a comic strip from Lynde. It became \"Chief Plenty Bucks\", set in the West and starring a capitalistic Native American chief. Lynde drew ten pages, but the project was shelved and never published in Dagens Industri. In 1997, the strip was revived for the Swedish Fantomen magazine (and its Norwegian and Finnish counterparts). The title was changed to Chief Sly Fox and a total of 86 pages (including the originals from the 1980s) were published from 1997 to 2000. They have never been published in English.[3]\\nIn 2002, Lynde returned with another exclusive comic for Fantomen; Bad Bob about a hopeless Wild West criminal. This strip was published irregularly in Fantomen until 2010.\\nIn December 2012, Lynde announced relocating to Ecuador.[4] He quoted Charles Marion Russell in his last blog post stating of his time: Just a little sunshine, just a little rain. Just a little pleasure, just a little pain. After moving to Ecuador, Lynde fell ill but initially believed he had bronchitis. In May 2013 it was discovered to be a form of lung cancer and he moved back to Helena MT where he died at age 81 on 6 August 2013.[5]\\nStan Lynde and his wife Lynda founded Cottonwood Publishing in order to publish books reprinting his comics, plus publish new material, primarily Western novels.\\nMerlin Fanshaw series\\nStand Alone Novel\\n',\n",
       "  'Maurilio Manara (/məˈnɑːrə/; born 12 September 1945), known professionally as Milo Manara, is an Italian comic book writer and artist.\\nAfter architecture and painting studies, he made his comics debut in 1969 drawing for Genius, a fumetti neri series of pocket books from publisher Furio Vanio in the wake of the popularity of Kriminal and Satanik.[1] In 1970, he illustrated for the magazine Terror, and starting in 1971 drew the erotic series Jolanda de Almaviva written by Francisco Rubino, issued in small format by publisher Erregi. Joining the youth magazine Il Corriere dei Ragazzi, he worked with Rubino, Carlo Barbieri, Mino Milani and Silverio Pisú.[2] With Pisú Manara launched the publications Telerompo and Strategia della Tensione in 1974 and the series Alessio, Il Borghese Rivoluzionario, and with writer Mino Milani the series La parola alla giuria in 1975. Manara and Pisú later went on to publish Lo Scimmiotto (The Ape) along the story of the Chinese Monkey King in Alter Linus in 1976, and with Alfredo Castelli, L\\'Uomo delle Nevi (The Snowman) in 1978.[2]\\nDuring this period Manara began publishing work in several Franco-Belgian comics magazines including Charlie Mensuel, Pilote and L\\'Écho des savanes.[1] For (A SUIVRE) Manara created the first stories featuring HP and Giuseppe Bergman, which grew to become a large body of work. The character \"HP\" is based on Manara\\'s friend, the Italian comics creator Hugo Pratt, and a collaborator on some of Manara\\'s most acclaimed work, initially Tutto ricominciò con un\\'estate indiana (1983, Indian Summer) and later El Gaucho (1991). Manara also completed two stories working with another of his heroes, Federico Fellini.[1] In his own right Manara has been commended on his skills as a writer, as with the western L\\'uomo di carta (1982, The Paper Man).[2]\\nManara\\'s reputation for producing comics that revolve around elegant, beautiful women caught up in unlikely and fantastical erotic scenarios became solidified with work such as Il Gioco (1983, also known as Click or Le Déclic), about a device which renders women helplessly aroused; Il Profumo dell\\'invisibile (1986, Butterscotch), introducing the heroine Miele (Honey) and a sweet-smelling body-paint which makes the wearer invisible; and Candid camera (1988, Hidden Camera), featuring the same protagonist in further explicit adventures. In the following years of combining sequels, original work, and collaborations with noted creators, Manara\\'s production continued in this direction to explore erotic comics themes with an artistic and storytelling expression in a manner considered unique to Manara.\\nIn the U.S. The Ape was serialised in Heavy Metal in the early 1980s and Manara received some exposure through collaborations with Neil Gaiman and other artists.\\nIn connection with their joint project Quarantasei, in July 2006, Manara designed a helmet for Moto GP rider Valentino Rossi, specifically made for the Italian GP in Mugello. Rossi declared:\\n\"He has drawn some kind of a mythical history of my life, in cartoons, with some of my heroes such as Steve McQueen, Enzo Ferrari, Jim Morrison, and other characters such as my dog Guido, the chicken Osvaldo and a lot of beautiful women! I really like Milo...he\\'s a person that I have admired for a long time.\"In 2003, Manara\\'s work featured on the cover of Scottish rock band Biffy Clyro\\'s second studio album The Vertigo of Bliss. Manara also created the artwork for all the singles released from this album.\\nIn October 2006, Manara developed character designs for the animated television series City Hunters. The series, consisting of ten 11-minute episodes, blends traditional animation techniques with modern CGI, to be broadcast across all of Latin America on the FOX network throughout 2006 and 2007.\\nManara penciled an X-Men project written by Chris Claremont for Marvel Comics called X-Men: Ragazze in fuga that released in April 2009 in Italy, and was later reprinted in short circulation by Marvel Comics in English as X-Women.[3]\\nIn 2013 he started to do low print variant covers for issues of Marvel comic books.\\nHe was profiled in the 2011 documentary film Derailments (Deragliamenti).[4]\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nRichard Burton Matheson (February 20, 1926\\xa0– June 23, 2013) was an American author and screenwriter, primarily in the fantasy, horror, and science fiction genres.\\nHe is best known as the author of I Am Legend, a 1954 science fiction horror novel that has been adapted for the screen three times. Matheson himself was co-writer of the first film version, The Last Man on Earth, starring Vincent Price, which was released in 1964. The other two adaptations were The Omega Man, starring Charlton Heston, and I Am Legend, with Will Smith. Matheson also wrote 16 television episodes of The Twilight Zone, including \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\", \"Little Girl Lost\" and \"Steel\", as well as several adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories for Roger Corman and American International Pictures – House of Usher, The Pit and the Pendulum, Tales of Terror and The Raven. He adapted his 1971 short story \"Duel\" as a screenplay, directed by Steven Spielberg as the television film of the same name that year.\\nIn addition to I Am Legend and Duel, nine more of his novels and short stories have been adapted as motion pictures: The Shrinking Man (filmed as The Incredible Shrinking Man), Hell House (filmed as The Legend of Hell House), What Dreams May Come, Bid Time Return (filmed as Somewhere in Time), A Stir of Echoes, \"Steel\" (filmed as Real Steel), and \"Button, Button\" (filmed as The Box). The movie Cold Sweat was based on his novel Ride the Nightmare, and Les seins de glace (Icy Breasts) was based on his novel Someone Is Bleeding. Both \"Steel\" and \"Button\" had previously been episodes of The Twilight Zone.\\nMatheson was born in Allendale, New Jersey, to Norwegian immigrants Bertolf and Fanny Matheson. They divorced when he was eight, and he was raised in Brooklyn, New York, by his mother. His early writing influences were the film Dracula (1931), novels by Kenneth Roberts, and a poem which he read in the newspaper Brooklyn Eagle,[2] where he published his first short story at age eight.[3] He entered Brooklyn Technical High School in 1939, graduated in 1943, and served with the Army in Europe during World War II; this formed the basis for his 1960 novel The Beardless Warriors.[2][4] He attended the Missouri School of Journalism at the University of Missouri, earning his BA in 1949, then moved to California.[2][3]\\nHis first-written novel, Hunger and Thirst, was ignored by publishers for several decades before eventually being published in 2010, but his short story \"Born of Man and Woman\" was published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\\'s summer 1950 issue, the new quarterly\\'s third issue,[1] and attracted attention.[3] It is the tale of a monstrous child chained by its parents in the cellar, written in the form of the creature\\'s diary and using non-idiomatic English. Later that year, Matheson placed stories in the first and third issues of Galaxy Science Fiction, a new monthly.[1] His first anthology of work was published in 1954.[3] Between 1950 and 1971, he produced dozens of stories, frequently blending elements of the science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres.\\nHe was a member of the \"Southern California Sorcerers\" group in the 1950s and 1960s, a collective of west coast writers which included Charles Beaumont, Ray Bradbury, George Clayton Johnson, William F. Nolan, Jerry Sohl, and others.[5]\\nMatheson\\'s first novel to be published, Someone Is Bleeding, appeared from Lion Books in 1953.[1] In the 1950s, he published a handful of Western stories (later collected in By the Gun), and in the 1990s, he published Western novels such as Journal of the Gun Years, The Gunfight, The Memoirs of Wild Bill Hickok, and Shadow on the Sun.\\nHis other early novels include The Shrinking Man (1956, filmed in 1957 as The Incredible Shrinking Man, again from Matheson\\'s own screenplay) and a science fiction vampire novel, I Am Legend (1954, filmed as The Last Man on Earth in 1964, The Omega Man in 1971, and I Am Legend in 2007). In 1960, Matheson published The Beardless Warriors, a non-fantastic, autobiographical novel about teenage American soldiers in World War II. It was filmed in 1967 as The Young Warriors, though most of Matheson\\'s plot was jettisoned. \\nMatheson wrote teleplays for several television programs, including the Westerns Cheyenne, Have Gun – Will Travel, and Lawman.[6] He also wrote the Star Trek episode \"The Enemy Within\" (1966). However, he is most closely associated with the American TV series The Twilight Zone, for which he wrote more than a dozen episodes,[6] including \"Steel\" (1963), \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" (1963), \"Little Girl Lost\" (1962), and \"Death Ship\" (1963). For all of his Twilight Zone scripts, Matheson wrote the introductory and closing statements spoken by creator Rod Serling.[7] He adapted five works of Edgar Allan Poe for Roger Corman\\'s Poe series, including House of Usher (1960), The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), and The Raven (1963).[3] He was one of the key screenwriters in Corman\\'s career.[8]\\nFor Hammer Film Productions, he wrote the screenplay for Fanatic (1965; US title: Die! Die! My Darling!), starring Tallulah Bankhead and Stefanie Powers and based on the novel Nightmare by Anne Blaisdell; he also adapted for Hammer Dennis Wheatley\\'s The Devil Rides Out (1968).[3]\\nIn 1971, Mattheson\\'s short story \"Duel\" was adapted into the TV movie of the same name. In 1973, Matheson earned an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for his teleplay for The Night Stalker (1972), one of two TV movies written by Matheson for producer Dan Curtis, the other being The Night Strangler (1973), which preceded the TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker. Matheson worked extensively with Curtis; the 1977 television anthology film Dead of Night features three stories written for the screen by Matheson: \"Second Chance\" (based on the story by Jack Finney); \"No Such Thing as a Vampire\" (based on Matheson\\'s story of the same name); and \"Bobby\", an original script written for this anthology by Matheson.\\nThree of his short stories were filmed together as Trilogy of Terror (1975), including \"Prey\" (initially published in the April 1969 issue of Playboy magazine), a tale of a Zuni warrior fetish doll. The doll later reappeared in the final segment of the belated sequel to the first movie, Trilogy of Terror II (1996), and \"Bobby\" from Dead of Night was refilmed with different actors for the second segment of the film.\\nOther Matheson novels adapted into films in the 1970s include Bid Time Return (1975, released as Somewhere in Time in 1980), and Hell House (1971, released as The Legend of Hell House in 1973), both adapted and scripted by Matheson himself.\\nIn the 1980s, Matheson published the novel Earthbound, wrote several screenplays for the TV series Amazing Stories, and continued to publish short fiction.\\nMatheson published four Western novels in this decade, as well as the suspense novel Seven Steps to Midnight (1993) and the darkly comic locked-room mystery novel Now You See It\\xa0... (1995), dedicated to Robert Bloch.\\nHe also wrote the screenplays for several movies, including the comedy Loose Cannons (1990) and the television biopic The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story (1990), as well as a segment of Twilight Zone: Rod Serling\\'s Lost Classics (1994) and segments of Trilogy of Terror II. Matheson continued to write short stories, and two more of his novels were adapted by others for the big screen: What Dreams May Come (1998) and A Stir of Echoes (1999, as Stir of Echoes). In 1999, Matheson published a non-fiction work, The Path, inspired by his interest in psychic phenomena.[3]\\nMany previously unpublished novels by Matheson appeared late in his career, as did various collections of his work and previously unpublished screenplays. He also wrote new works, such as the suspense novel Hunted Past Reason (2002)[9] and the children\\'s illustrated fantasy Abu and the 7 Marvels (2002).\\nSeveral of Matheson\\'s stories, including \"Third from the Sun\" (1950), \"Deadline\" (1959), and \"Button, Button\" (1970), are simple sketches with twist endings; others, like \"Trespass\" (1953), \"Being\" (1954), and \"Mute\" (1962), explore their characters\\' dilemmas over 20 or 30 pages. Some tales, such as \"The Doll that Does Everything\" (1954) and \"The Funeral\" (1955), incorporate satirical humor at the expense of genre clichés, and are written in bombastic prose that differed from Matheson\\'s usual pared-down style. Others, like \"The Test\" (1954) and \"Steel\" (1956), portray the moral and physical struggles of ordinary people, rather than those of scientists and superheroes, in situations which are at once futuristic and quotidian. Still others, such as \"Mad House\" (1953), \"The Curious Child\" (1954) and \"Duel\" (1971), are tales of paranoia, in which the commonplace environment of the present day becomes inexplicably alien or threatening.\\nMatheson cited specific inspirations for many of his works. Duel was derived from an incident in which he and friend Jerry Sohl were dangerously tailgated by a large truck on the same day as the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[3]\\nAccording to film critic Roger Ebert, Matheson\\'s scientific approach to the supernatural in I Am Legend and other novels from the 1950s and early 1960s \"anticipated pseudorealistic fantasy novels like Rosemary\\'s Baby and The Exorcist.\"[10]\\nIn 1952, Matheson married Ruth Ann Woodson, whom he met in California. They had four children:[2] Bettina Mayberry, Richard Christian, Christopher Matheson and Ali Marie Matheson. Richard, Chris, and Ali became writers of fiction and screenplays.[citation needed]\\nMatheson died on June 23, 2013, at his home in Calabasas, California, at the age of 87.[11][12][13][14]\\nMatheson received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1984 and the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Horror Writers Association in 1991. The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted him in 2010.[15][16]\\nAt the annual World Fantasy Conventions, he won two judged, annual literary awards for particular works: World Fantasy Awards for Bid Time Return as the best novel of 1975 and Richard Matheson: Collected Stories as the best collection of 1989.[15][17]\\nMatheson died just days before he was due to receive the Visionary Award at the 39th Saturn Awards ceremony. As a tribute, the ceremony was dedicated to him and the award was presented posthumously. Academy president Robert Holguin said, \"Richard\\'s accomplishments will live on forever in the imaginations of everyone who read or saw his inspired and inimitable work.\"[18]\\nStephen King has listed Matheson as a creative influence, and his novels Cell (2006) and Elevation (2018) are dedicated to Matheson, along with filmmaker George A. Romero. Romero frequently acknowledged Matheson as an inspiration and listed the shambling vampire creatures that appear in The Last Man on Earth, the first film version of I Am Legend, as the inspiration for the zombie \"ghouls\" he envisioned in Night of the Living Dead.[19]\\nAnne Rice stated that Matheson\\'s short story \"Dress of White Silk\" was an early influence on her interest in vampires and fantasy fiction.[20]\\n\\nAfter his death, several figures offered tributes to his life and work. Director Steven Spielberg said: Richard Matheson\\'s ironic and iconic imagination created seminal science-fiction stories and gave me my first break when he wrote the short story and screenplay for Duel. His Twilight Zones were among my favorites, and he recently worked with us on Real Steel. For me, he is in the same category as Bradbury and Asimov.[21]\\nAnother frequent collaborator, Roger Corman, said: Richard Matheson was a close friend and the best screenwriter I ever worked with. I always shot his first draft. I will miss him.[22]On Twitter, director Edgar Wright wrote, \"If it\\'s true that the great Richard Matheson has passed away, 140 characters can\\'t begin to cover what he has given the sci fi & horror genre.\" Director Richard Kelly added, \"I loved Richard Matheson\\'s writing and it was a huge honor getting to adapt his story \\'Button, Button\\' into a film.

       "  '\\nKarl Friedrich May (/maɪ/ MY, German: [kaʁl ˈmaɪ] ⓘ; 25 February 1842\\xa0– 30 March 1912) was a German author. He is best known for his novels of travels and adventures, set in the American Old West, the Orient, the Middle East, Latin America, China and Germany. He also wrote poetry, a play, and composed music. He was a proficient player of several musical instruments. Many of his works were adapted for film, theatre, audio dramas and comics. Later in his career, May turned to philosophical and spiritual genres. He is one of the best-selling German writers of all time, with about 200,000,000 copies sold worldwide.\\nMay was the fifth child of a poor family of weavers in Ernstthal, Schönburgische Rezessherrschaften (then part of the Kingdom of Saxony). He had 13 siblings, of whom nine died in infancy. His parents were Heinrich August May and Wilhelmine Christiane Weise.  During his school years, he received instruction in music and composition. At age twelve, May was making money at a skittle alley, where he was exposed to rough language.[2]\\nIn 1856, May commenced teacher training in Waldenburg, but in 1859 was expelled for stealing six candles. After an appeal, he was allowed to continue in Plauen. Shortly after graduation, when his roommate accused him of stealing a watch, May was jailed in Chemnitz for six weeks and his license to teach was revoked. After this, May worked with little success as a private tutor, an author of tales, a composer and a public speaker. For four years, from 1865 to 1869, May was jailed in the workhouse at Osterstein Castle, Zwickau. With good behaviour, May became an administrator of the prison library, which gave him the chance to read widely. He made a list of the works he planned to write (Repertorium C. May.)\\nOn his release, May continued his life of crime, impersonating various characters (policemen, doctors etc.) and spinning fantastic tales as a method of fraud. He was arrested, but when he was transported to a crime scene during a judicial investigation, he escaped and fled to Bohemia, where he was detained for vagrancy. For another four years, from 1870 to 1874, May was jailed in Waldheim, Saxony. There he met a Catholic Catechist, Johannes Kochta, who assisted May.[3]\\nAfter his release in May 1874, May returned to his parents\\' home in Ernstthal and began to write. In November 1874, Die Rose von Ernstthal (\"The Rose from Ernstthal\") was published.[4] May then became an editor in the publishing house of Heinrich Gotthold Münchmeyer in Dresden. May managed entertainment papers such as Schacht und Hütte (\"Mine and Mill\") and continued to publish his own works such as Geographische Predigten (\"Collected Travel Stories\") (1876). May resigned in 1876[4] and was employed by Bruno Radelli of Dresden.\\nIn 1878, May became a freelance writer. Once again, May was insolvent.[4] In 1882, May returned to the employ of Münchmeyer and began the first of five large colportage novels. One of these was Das Waldröschen (1882–1884). From 1879, May was also published in Deutscher Hausschatz (\"German House Treasure\"), a Catholic weekly journal from the press of Friedrich Pustet in Regensburg. In 1880, May began the Orient Cycle, which ran, with interruption, until 1888. May was also published in the teenage boys\\' journal Der Gute Kamerad (\"The Good Comrade\") of Wilhelm Spemann, Stuttgart. In 1887, it published Der Sohn des Bärenjägers (\"Son of the Bear Hunter\"). In 1891 Der Schatz im Silbersee (\"The Treasure of Silver Lake\") was published.  May published in other journals using pseudonyms. In all, he published over one hundred articles. In October 1888, May moved to Kötzschenbroda (a part of Radebeul) and in 1891 to Villa Agnes in Oberlößnitz. In 1891, Friedrich Ernst Fehsenfeld offered to print the Deutscher Hausschatz \"Son of the Bear Hunter\" stories as books. In 1892, the publication of Carl May\\'s Gesammelte Reiseromane (Collected Travel Accounts or Karl May\\'s Gesammelte Reiseerzählungen) brought financial security and recognition. May became deeply absorbed in the stories he wrote and the lives of his characters. Readers wrote to May, addressing him as the protagonists of his books. May conducted talking tours in Germany and Austria and allowed autographed cards to be printed and photos in costume to be taken. In December 1895, May moved to the Villa Shatterhand in Alt-Radebeul, which he purchased from the Ziller brothers.[5]\\nIn 1899, May traveled to Egypt then Sumatra with his servant, Sejd Hassan. In 1900, he was joined by Klara and Richard Plöhn. The group returned to Radebeul in July 1900. May demonstrated some emotional instability during his travels.[6]\\nHermann Cardauns and Rudolf Lebius criticised May for his self-promotion with the Old Shatterhand legend. He was also reproached for his writing for the Catholic Deutscher Hausschatz and several Marian calendars. There were also charges of unauthorised book publications and the use of an illegal doctoral degree. In 1902, May did receive a Doctor honoris causa from the Universitas Germana-Americana in Chicago for Im Reiche des Silbernen Löwen (\"In the Realm of the Silver Lion.\")[7] In 1908, Karl and Klara May spent six weeks in North America. They traveled through Albany, New York, Buffalo, New York, the Niagara Falls and visited friends in Lawrence, Massachusetts. May was inspired to write Winnetou IV.\\nOn his return, May began work on complex allegorical texts. He considered the \"question of mankind\", pacifism and the raising of humans from evil to good. Sascha Schneider provided symbolist covers for the Fehsenfeld edition. On 22 March 1912, May was invited by the Academic Society for Literature and Music in Vienna to present a lecture entitled Empor ins Reich der Edelmenschen (\"Upward to the Realm of Noble Men\"). There, he met pacifist and Nobel Laureate Bertha von Suttner.\\nMay died in his own Villa Shatterhand on 30 March 1912.[8] According to the register of deaths, the cause was cardiac arrest, acute bronchitis and asthma, but according to Ralf Harder from the Karl-May-Stiftung, May\\'s death certificate does not include the cause of death.[9] Scientists examining the remains of May in 2014 found excessive quantities of lead and other heavy metals, and concluded that his death was probably due to a long-time exposure to lead in water as well as tobacco.[10] May was buried in Radebeul East. His tomb was inspired by the Temple of Athena Nike.[9]\\nIn 1880, he married Emma Pollmer. They divorced in 1903 and had no children. May subsequently married Klara Plöhn, who was widowed.\\nMay used many pseudonyms, including \"Capitan Ramon Diaz de la Escosura\", \"D. Jam\", \"Emma Pollmer\", \"Ernst von Linden\", \"Hobble-Frank\", \"Karl Hohenthal\", \"M. Gisela\", \"P. van der Löwen\", \"Prinz Muhamel Lautréamont\" and \"Richard Plöhn\". Most pseudonymously or anonymously published works have been identified.\\nFor the novels set in America, May created the characters of Winnetou, the wise chief of the Apaches, and Old Shatterhand, Winnetou\\'s white blood brother. Another series of novels were set in the Ottoman Empire. In these, the narrator-protagonist, Kara Ben Nemsi, travels with his local guide and servant Hadschi Halef Omar through the Sahara desert to the Near East, experiencing many exciting adventures.\\nMay\\'s writing developed from the anonymous first-person observer-narrator (for example Der Gitano, 1875) to a narrator with heroic skills and equipment, to a fully formed first-person narrator-hero.[citation needed]\\nWith few exceptions, May had not visited the places he described, but he compensated successfully for his lack of direct experience through a combination of creativity, imagination, and documentary sources including maps, travel accounts and guidebooks, as well as anthropological and linguistic studies. The work of writers such as James Fenimore Cooper, Gabriel Ferry, Friedrich Gerstäcker, Balduin Möllhausen and Mayne Reid served as his models.[citation needed]\\nNon-dogmatic Christian values play an important role in May\\'s works. Some of the characters are described as being of German, particularly Saxon, origins.\\nIn a letter to a young Jew who intended to become a Christian after reading May\\'s books, May advised him first to understand his own religion, which he described as holy and exalted, until he was experienced enough to choose.[11]\\nIn his later works (after 1900) May left the adventure fiction genre to write symbolic novels with religious and pacifistic content. The change is best shown in Im Reiche des silbernen Löwen, where the first two parts are adventurous and the last two parts belong to the mature work.[citation needed]\\nIn his early work, May wrote in a variety of genres until he showed his proficiency in travel stories.[12] During his time as an editor, he published many of these works within the periodicals for which he was responsible.\\nThe shorter stories of the early work can be grouped as follows, although in some works genres overlap. Some of the shorter stories were later published in anthologies, for example, Der Karawanenwürger und andere Erzählungen (1894), Humoresken und Erzählungen (1902) and Erzgebirgische Dorfgeschichten (1903).\\nMay wrote five large (many thousands of pages) colportage novels, which he published either anonymously or under pseudonyms between 1882 and 1888.\\nFrom 1900 to 1906, Münchmeyer\\'s successor Adalbert Fischer published the first book editions. These were revised by third hand and published under May\\'s real name instead of pseudonyms. This edition was not authorized by May and he tried to stop its publication.[13]\\nThirty-three volumes of Carl May\\'s Gesammelte Reiseromane, (Karl May\\'s Gesammelte Reiseerzählungen) were published from 1892 to 1910 by Friedrich Ernst Fehsenfeld. Most had been previously published in Deutscher Hausschatz, but some were new. The best known titles are the Orient Cycle (volumes 1–6) and the Winnetou-Trilogy (volumes 7–9). Beyond these shorter cycles, the works are troubled by chronological inconsistencies arising when original articles were revised for book editions.\\nMay\\'s oeuvre includes some shorter travel stories that were not published within this series (for example, Eine Befreiung in Die Rose von Kaïrwan, 1894). After the founding of the Karl May Press in 1913, works in Gesammelte Werke were revised (sometimes extensively) and many received new titles. Texts (other than those from Fehsenfeld Press) were also added to the new series.\\nThese stories were written from 1887 to 1897 for the magazine Der Gute Kamerad. Most of the stories are set in the Wild West, but Old Shatterhand is just a figure and not the first-person narrator as he is in the travel stories. The best-known volume is Der Schatz im Silbersee. In the broadest sense, the early works Im fernen Westen and Der Waldläufer belong in this category.\\nMay\\'s mature work dates to 1900, after his travels to the East.[14] Many of them were published by Fehsenfeld.\\nMay was a member of the \"Lyra\" choir in about 1864 and composed musical works, including a version of Ave Maria and Vergiss mich nicht within Ernste Klänge, 1899.[15]\\nDuring his last years, May lectured on his philosophical ideas.\\nFurthermore, there are posthumous publications of fragments of stories and dramas, lyrics, musical compositions, letters and the library catalog.\\nAccording to an encyclopedia dedicated to May, he is the \"most read writer of the German tongue\". The total number of copies published is about 200 million, half of them in German.[16]\\nMay\\'s first translated work is considered to have been the first half of the Orient Cycle into a French daily in 1881.[17] Recently, it was discovered, and confirmed by Hans Dieter Steinmet (Karl May Museum) that Croatian writer Nikola Tordinac published a translation of May\\'s novel Tree carde monte in the magazine Sriemski Hrvat in 1880.[18] Tordinac\\'s translation became a part of the permanent exhibition of the Karl May Museum in 2017.[18] Since that time, May\\'s work has been translated into more than 30 languages, including Latin and Esperanto. In the 1960s, UNESCO indicated that May was the most frequently translated German writer.[16] His most popular translations are in Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian and Dutch.[17] Seabury Press, New York, began publishing English translations by Michael Shaw in 1977.[19] In 2001, Nemsi Books Publishing Company, Pierpont, South Dakota, was one of the first English publishing houses to produce the unabridged translations of May\\'s oeuvre. Since the closing of Nemsi Books in 2023, some of the English translations by Juergen Nett have been made available on Amazon through KDP.\\nMay had a substantial influence on a number of well-known German-speaking people and on the German population itself.[20] The popularity of his writing, and his (generally German) protagonists, are seen as having filled a lack in the German psyche, which had few popular heroes until the 19th century.[21] His readers longed to escape from an industrialised, capitalist society, an escape which May offered.[22] May \"helped shape the collective German dream of feats far beyond middle-class bounds.\"[21] and contributed to the popular image of Native Americans in German-speaking countries, which has been described by many as racist and harmful.[23]\\nThe name Winnetou has an entry in the German dictionary, Duden. The wider influence on the populace also surprised US occupation troops after World War II, who realised that thanks to May, \"Cowboys and Indians\" were familiar concepts to local children (though fantastic and removed from reality).[20]\\nMany well-known German-speaking people used May\\'s heroes as models in their childhood.[24] Albert Einstein enjoyed May\\'s books and said, \"My whole adolescence stood under his sign. Indeed, even today, he has been dear to me in many a desperate hour...\"[21]\\nAdolf Hitler was an admirer, who noted in Mein Kampf that the novels \"overwhelmed\" him as a boy, going as far as to ensure \"a noticeable decline\" in his school grades. According to an anonymous friend, Hitler attended the lecture given by May in Vienna in March 1912 and was enthusiastic about the event.[25] The lecture was an appeal for peace, also heard by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Bertha von Suttner. May died suddenly only ten days after the lecture, leaving the young Hitler deeply upset.[26] Claus Roxin noted that he doubts the anonymous description, because Hitler had said much about May, but not that he had seen him.[27] Hitler defended May against critics in the men\\'s hostel where he lived in Vienna, as the evidence of May\\'s earlier time in jail had come to light; although it was true, Hitler confessed that May had never visited the sites of his American adventure stories. This made him a greater writer in Hitler\\'s view since it showed the author\\'s powers of imagination. \\nHitler later recommended the books to his generals and had special editions distributed to soldiers at the front, praising Winnetou as an example of \"tactical finesse and circumspection\",[28] though some note that the latter claims of using the books as military guidance are not substantiated.[21] However, as told by Albert Speer, \"when faced by seemingly hopeless situations, he [Hitler] would still reach for these stories,\" because \"they gave him courage like works of philosophy for others or the Bible for elderly people.\"[28] Hitler\\'s admiration for May led the German writer Klaus Mann to accuse May of having been a form of \"mentor\" for Hitler.[20] In his admiration, Hitler ignored May\\'s Christian and humanitarian approach and views completely, not mentioning his relatively sympathetic description of Jews and other persons of non-Northern European ancestry. The National Socialists in particular tried to use May\\'s popularity and his work for their purposes.[21]\\nThe popularity of May\\'s books sparked a fascination in German popular culture with the Indigenous peoples of North America that continues to this day. In 1985, the German scholar Hartmut Lutz invented the term Deutsche Indianertümelei (\"German Indian Enthusiasm\") for the phenomenon.[29] The phrase Indianertümelei is a reference to the German term Deutschtümelei (\"German Enthusiasm\") which mockingly describes the phenomenon of celebrating in an excessively nationalistic and romanticized manner Deutschtum (\"Germanness\").[29] In the English-speaking world, the phenomenon of the German obsession with the First Nations of North America is known as \"Indianthusiasm\".[29] In a 1999 speech delivered in the United States in English, Lutz declared:\\nFor over two hundred years Germans have found Indianer so fascinating that even today an Indian iconography is used in advertising. The most popular image of the Indianer is provided by Karl May\\'s fictional Apache chief Winnetou...Indian lore is profitable and marketable, as some Native Americans travelling in Germany may attest...There is a marked Indian presence in German everyday culture, even down to the linguistic level, where sentences like ein Indianer weint nicht (an Indian doesn\\'t cry), ein Indianer kennt keinen Schmerz (an Indian braves pain) or figures such as der letzte Mohikaner (the Last of the Mohicans) have become part of the everyday speech.[30]As part of the phenomenon of Indianertümelei a number of Western and Indian theme parks operate in Germany, the most popular of which are the Pullman City theme park outside of Munich and El Dorado theme park outside of Berlin.[31] May\\'s books also inspired hobbyist clubs, where Germans pretend to be cowboys or Indians, the first of which was the Cowboy Club founded in Munich in 1913.[31] In 2019, it was estimated that between 40,000 and 100,000 Germans are involved in Indianer hobbyist clubs at any given moment.[31] Interviewed in 2007, one member of an Indianer club stated: \"Our camp is always in summer, in July for two weeks. During this time, we live in tipis, we wear only Indian clothes. We don\\'t use technology and we try to follow Indian traditions. We have those [pretending to be] Lakota, Oglala, Blackfeet, Blood, Siksika, Pawneee... and we go on the warpath against each other day and night, anytime at all. In two weeks, every tribe can fight each other. We don\\'t know when somebody will attack or when they will come to steal our horses. And the battles are always exciting, too. I really enjoy them\".[32]\\nThe German writer Carl Zuckmayer was intrigued by May\\'s Apache chief and named his daughter Maria Winnetou.[16] Max von der Grün said he read May as a young boy. When asked whether reading May\\'s books had given him anything, he answered, \"No. It took something away from me. The fear of bulky books, that is.\"[33]\\nHeinz Werner Höber, the twofold Glauser prize winner, was a follower of May. He said, \"When I was about 12 years old I wrote my first novel on Native Americans which was, of course, from the beginning to the end completely stolen from Karl May.\" He had pleaded with friends to get him to Radebeul \"because Radebeul meant Karl May\". There, he was deeply impressed by the museum and said, \"My great fellow countryman from Hohenstein-Ernstthal and his immortal heroes have never left me ever since.\"[34]\\nAsteroid 15728 Karlmay is named in May\\'s honour.[35]\\nMay\\'s poem Ave Maria (1896) was set to music in at least 19 versions. Other poems, especially from the collection Himmelsgedanken were also set to music. Carl Ball wrote Harp Clangs for the drama Babel und Bibel for May. The Swiss composer Othmar Schoeck adapted Der Schatz im Silbersee for opera. May\\'s concepts, such as Winnetou\\'s death, inspired musical works.[36]\\nThe first stage adaptation of May\\'s work was Winnetou (1919) by Hermann Dimmler. Dimmler and Ludwig Körner made revised editions of the play. Different novel revisions have been played on outdoor stages since the 1940s. The Karl May Festival in Bad Segeberg has been held every summer since 1952 and in Lennestadt-Elspe since 1958. At some of these festivals, Pierre Brice has played Winnetou. Another festival has been conducted on a rock stage in Rathen, in Saxon Switzerland near Radebeul in 1940 and then since 1984.[37]\\nIn 1920, May\\'s friend Marie Luise Droop, her husband Adolf Droop and the Karl May Press founded Ustad-Film, a production company. Ustad-Film made three silent movies (Auf den Trümmern des Paradieses, Die Todeskarawane and Die Teufelsanbeter) after the Orientcycle. The company became bankrupt in 1921 and the films are lost.[16] In 1936 a first sound movie Durch die Wüste was shown. Die Sklavenkarawane\\xa0[de] (1958) and its sequel Der Löwe von Babylon\\xa0[de] (1959) were the first colour movies.\\nFrom 1962 to 1968, a series of May movies were made.[38] While most of the seventeen movies of this series were Wild West movies (beginning with Der Schatz im Silbersee), three were based on the Orientcycle and two on Das Waldröschen. Most of these movies were made separately by the two competitors Horst Wendlandt and Artur Brauner. Several actors were employed, including Lex Barker (Old Shatterhand, Kara Ben Nemsi, Karl Sternau), Pierre Brice (Winnetou), Gojko Mitić (Winnetou), Stewart Granger (Old Surehand), Milan Srdoč (Old Wabble) and Ralf Wolter (Sam Hawkens, Hadschi Halef Omar, André Hasenpfeffer). The film score by Martin Böttcher and the landscape of Yugoslavia are associated with the movies. Other movies such as Die Spur führt zum Silbersee (1990) and TV productions such as Das Buschgespenst (1986) and the television series Kara Ben Nemsi Effendi (1973) were produced. The productions vary from the original written works.[38]\\nIn 2016, German RTL Television premiered three-part television movies based on Winnetou, directed by Philipp Stölzl.[39] In the part \"Winnetou and Old Shatterhand\", Gojko Mitić, one of the actors who played Winnetou in the \\'60s movies, portrayed a character named Intschu Tschuna.\\nMay\\'s works (about 300) have been adapted for audio dramas, particularly in the 1960s.[16][40] The first, Der Schatz im Silbersee, was written by Günther Bibo in 1929.[16] There are also Czech and Danish versions of the audio dramas.[40] In 1988, Der Schatz im Silbersee was read by Gert Westphal and published as an audiobook. Wann sehe ich dich wieder, du lieber, lieber Winnetou? (1995) is a compendium of Karl May texts read by Hermann Wiedenroth.[40]\\nIn the 1950s Croatian comic book artist Walter Neugebauer finished his 1930s comic book adaptation of Karl May\\'s stories.[41] Serbian artist Aleksandar Hecl also drew one.[42] In the 1960s and 1970s, May\\'s works were adapted for German comics including an eight-issue series based on Winnetou and a further nine-issue series titled Karl May (1963–1965). The series was drawn by Helmut Nickel and Harry Ehrt and published by Walter Lehning Verlag. Belgian comics artist Willy Vandersteen created a whole series of comics based on May\\'s stories, simply titled Karl May (1962–1977).[43] Eighty-seven issues of Karl May were published by Standaard Uitgeverij from 1962 to 1987. Comics based on May\\'s novels were also produced in Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Mexico, Spain and Sweden.[44]\\nMay\\'s life has been the subject of screen works, novels and a stage play, including \\nMay was copied or parodied during his lifetime. Some wrote similar Wild West stories. Others, such as Franz Treller, published under May\\'s name.[45] Novelizations of May\\'s characters include \\nIn his will, May made his second wife, Klara, his sole heiress. He instructed that after her death all of his property and any future earnings from his work should go to a foundation. This foundation should support the education of the gifted poor including writers, journalists, and editors. One year after May\\'s death, on 5 March 1913, Klara May established the \"Karl May Foundation\" (\"Karl-May-Stiftung\"). Contributions have been made since 1917. Klara and Karl May\\'s estate went to the foundation. The foundation established the Karl May Museum to maintain the Villa Shatterhand, the estates, the collections and May\\'s tomb.[46][47] In 1960, the Karl May Foundation received the Karl May Press.[47]\\nOn 1 July 1913, Klara May, Friedrich Ernst Fehsenfeld (May\\'s main publisher) and the jurist Euchar Albrecht Schmid established the \"Foundation Press Fehsenfeld & Co.\" (\"Stiftungs-Verlag Fehsenfeld & Co.\") in Radebeul. In 1915, the name changed to \"Karl May Press\" (\"Karl-May-Verlag\" (KMV)). The KMV consolidated the rights to May\\'s works from internal discord and from other publishers.[48] Third-hand revisions of these texts were added to the series Karl May\\'s Gesammelte Reiseerzählungen, which was renamed to Karl May\\'s Gesammelte Werke (und Briefe). The existing 33 volumes of the original series were also revised, some extensively. By 1945 there were 65 volumes. The press is exclusive to May\\'s work and subsidiary literature. Besides the Gesammelte Werke (the classical \"green volumes\"), which have 91 volumes today, the press has a huge reprint programme.\\nThe Karl May Press aims to rehabilitate May from literary criticism and to support the Karl May Foundation. In 1921, Fehsenfeld left and in 1960, the foundation fell to Klara May\\'s estate, and thus the Press is owned by the Schmid family. In 1959, due to censorship in the Soviet occupation zone and East Germany, the Press moved to Bamberg (Germany). In 1963, when copyright ended, the Press began commercialising May\\'s works. After German reunification, in 1996, the Press took a second office in Radebeul. The name \"Karl May\" is a registered trade mark of the \"Karl May Verwaltungs- und Vertriebs-GmbH\", which belongs to the Karl May Press.[48]\\nThe Karl May Museum is in the Villa Shatterhand in Radebeul and contains artifacts from May\\'s life as well as from life on the American frontier and Native American life of that era.[49]  It was founded in 1928 by May\\'s widow and an eccentric Austrian named Ernst Tobis.[50]  When the Nazis took over Germany, they appropriated the museum and the image of May, and were especially focused on swastikas that appeared in some of the Native American artwork.  Hitler Youth were encouraged to visit the museum and hear stories from Tobis.[51] After World War II, the original museum remained in East Germany and a replica was built in Bamberg in West Germany.[52]:\\u200a73\\u200a  From 1956 to 1984, the museum in Radebeul was called the \"Indianer Museum\", because May\\'s books were suppressed by the East German government; its original name was restored in 1986.[49]  Around 2010, controversy arose over scalps, some of them from Native Americans, that were in the museum\\'s collection.[50]\\nThe \"Karl May House\" (\"Karl-May-Haus\") is the three-centuries-old weaver house where May was born. Since 12 March 1985, it has been a memorial and museum. It shows an original weaving room and non-German book editions. The garden has been arranged according to May\\'s description in his memoirs.\\nOpposite the house is the International Karl May Heritage Center (\"Karl-May-Begegnungsstätte\"), which is used for events and special exhibitions. In Hohenstein-Ernstthal, called \"Karl May Home Town\" since 1992, every May-related place has a commemorative plaque. These places are connected by a \"Karl May Path\" (\"Karl-May-Wanderweg\"). Outside the city lies the \"Karl May Cave\" (\"Karl-May-Höhle\"), where May found shelter during his criminal times.[53]\\nIn the 1890s, there were Karl May clubs.[54] Today, various entities focus on research about the author.[55] These organisations exist in German-speaking regions, the Netherlands, Australia and Indonesia. While such societies are responsible for the release of most May-related periodicals, for example, Der Beobachter an der Elbe, Karl-May-Haus Information, Wiener Karl-May-Brief, and Karl May in Leipzig, the magazine Karl May & Co. is published independently.\\nThe \"Karl May Society\" (KMG), founded on 22 March 1969, is the largest organisation, with approximately 1800 members.[56] The KMG publishes Jahrbuch, Mitteilungen, Sonderhefte der Karl-May-Gesellschaft, and KMG-Nachrichten and reprints. Since 2008 and in cooperation with the Karl May Foundation and the Karl May Press, the KMG has published the critiqued edition of \"Karl Mays Werke\". This project was initiated by Hans Wollschläger and Hermann Wiedenroth in 1987.[13][57]\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nCormac McCarthy (born Charles Joseph McCarthy Jr.; July 20, 1933 – June 13, 2023) was an American writer who wrote twelve novels, two plays, five screenplays, and three short stories, spanning the Western, postapocalyptic, and Southern Gothic genres. His works often include graphic depictions of violence, and his writing style is characterised by a sparse use of punctuation and attribution. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American novelists.[1][2][3]\\nMcCarthy was born in Providence, Rhode Island, although he was raised primarily in Tennessee. In 1951, he enrolled in the University of Tennessee, but dropped out to join the U.S. Air Force. His debut novel, The Orchard Keeper, was published in 1965. Awarded literary grants, McCarthy was able to travel to southern Europe, where he wrote his second novel, Outer Dark (1968). Suttree (1979), like his other early novels, received generally positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. A MacArthur Fellowship enabled him to travel to the American Southwest, where he researched and wrote his fifth novel, Blood Meridian (1985). Although it initially garnered a lukewarm critical and commercial reception, it has since been regarded as his magnum opus, with some labeling it the Great American Novel.\\nMcCarthy first experienced widespread success with All the Pretty Horses (1992), for which he received both the National Book Award[4] and the National Book Critics Circle Award. It was followed by The Crossing (1994) and Cities of the Plain (1998), completing The Border Trilogy. His 2005 novel No Country for Old Men received mixed reviews. His 2006 novel The Road won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction.\\nMany of McCarthy\\'s works have been adapted into film. The 2007 film adaptation of No Country for Old Men was a critical and commercial success, winning four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The films All the Pretty Horses, The Road, and Child of God were also adapted from his works of the same names, and Outer Dark was turned into a 15-minute short. McCarthy had a play adapted into a 2011 film, The Sunset Limited.\\nMcCarthy worked with the Santa Fe Institute, a multidisciplinary research center, where he published the essay \"The Kekulé Problem\" (2017), which explores the human unconscious and the origin of language. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2012.[5] His final novels, The Passenger and Stella Maris, were published on October 25, 2022, and December 6, 2022, respectively.[6]\\nCharles Joseph McCarthy Jr.[7]  was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on July\\xa020, 1933, one of six children of Gladys Christina McGrail and Charles Joseph McCarthy.[8] His family was Irish Catholic.[9] In 1937, the family relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, where his father worked as a lawyer for the Tennessee Valley Authority.[10] The family first lived on Noelton Drive in the upscale Sequoyah Hills subdivision, but by 1941, had settled in a house on Martin Mill Pike in South Knoxville.[11] McCarthy later said, \"We were considered rich because all the people around us were living in one- or two-room shacks.\"[12] Among his childhood friends was Jim Long (1930–2012), who was later depicted as J-Bone in Suttree.[13]\\nMcCarthy attended St. Mary\\'s Parochial School and Knoxville Catholic High School,[14] and was an altar boy at Knoxville\\'s Church of the Immaculate Conception.[13] As a child, McCarthy saw no value in school, preferring to pursue his own interests. He described a moment when his teacher asked the class about their hobbies. McCarthy answered eagerly, as he later said, \"I was the only one with any hobbies and I had every hobby there was\\xa0... name anything, no matter how esoteric. I could have given everyone a hobby and still had 40 or 50 to take home.\"[15]\\nIn 1951, he began attending the University of Tennessee, studying liberal arts.[16] He became interested in writing after a professor asked him to repunctuate a collection of eighteenth-century essays for inclusion in a textbook.[17] McCarthy left college in 1953 to join the U.S. Air Force. While stationed in Alaska, McCarthy read books voraciously, which he said was the first time he had done so.[12] He returned to the University of Tennessee in 1957, where he majored in English and published two stories, \"Wake for Susan\" and \"A Drowning Incident\" in the student literary magazine, The Phoenix, writing under the name C. J. McCarthy, Jr. For these, he won the Ingram-Merrill Award for creative writing in 1959 and 1960. In 1959, McCarthy dropped out of college and left for Chicago.[10][12]\\nFor the purpose of his writing career, McCarthy changed his first name from Charles to Cormac to avoid confusion, and comparison, with ventriloquist Edgar Bergen\\'s dummy Charlie McCarthy.[18] \"Cormac\" is the Gaelic version of \"Charles\".[19]\\nCormac had been a family nickname given to his father by his Irish aunts.[12] Other sources say he changed his name to honor the Irish chieftain Cormac MacCarthy, who constructed Blarney Castle.[20]\\nAfter marrying fellow student Lee Holleman in 1961, McCarthy moved to what Lee\\'s obituary calls \"a shack with no heat and running water in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains outside of Knoxville.\" There, the couple had a son, Cullen, in 1962.[21] When writer James Agee\\'s childhood home was being demolished in Knoxville that year, McCarthy used the site\\'s bricks to build fireplaces inside his Sevier County shack.[22] Lee moved to Wyoming shortly after, where she filed for divorce from McCarthy.[21]\\nRandom House published McCarthy\\'s first novel, The Orchard Keeper, in 1965.[12] He had finished the novel while working part time at an auto-parts warehouse in Chicago and submitted the manuscript \"blindly\" to Albert Erskine of Random House.[12][23] Erskine continued to edit McCarthy\\'s work for the next 20 years.[23] Upon its release, critics noted its similarity to the work of Faulkner and praised McCarthy\\'s striking use of imagery.[24][25] The Orchard Keeper won a 1966 William Faulkner Foundation Award for notable first novel.[26]\\nWhile living in the French Quarter in New Orleans, McCarthy was evicted from a $40-a-month room for failing to pay his rent.[12] When he traveled the country, McCarthy always carried a 100-watt bulb in his bag so he could read at night, no matter where he was sleeping.[15]\\nIn the summer of 1965, using a Traveling Fellowship award from The American Academy of Arts and Letters, McCarthy shipped out aboard the liner Sylvania hoping to visit Ireland. On the ship, he met Englishwoman Anne DeLisle, who was working on the ship as a dancer and singer. In 1966, they were married in England. Also in 1966, he received a Rockefeller Foundation grant, which he used to travel around Southern Europe before landing in Ibiza, where he wrote his second novel, Outer Dark (1968). Afterward, he returned to the United States with his wife, where Outer Dark was published to generally favorable reviews.[27]\\nIn 1969, the couple moved to Louisville, Tennessee, and purchased a dairy barn,[28] which McCarthy renovated, doing the stonework himself.[27] According to DeLisle, the couple lived in \"total poverty\", bathing in a lake. DeLisle claimed, \"Someone would call up and offer him $2,000 to come speak at a university about his books. And he would tell them that everything he had to say was there on the page. So we would eat beans for another week.\"[12] While living in the barn, he wrote his next book, Child of God (1973).[29] Like Outer Dark before it, Child of God was set in southern Appalachia. In 1976, McCarthy separated from Anne DeLisle and moved to El Paso, Texas.[30]\\nIn 1974, Richard Pearce of PBS contacted McCarthy and asked him to write the screenplay for an episode of Visions, a television drama series. Beginning in early 1975, and armed with only \"a few photographs in the footnotes to a 1928 biography of a famous pre-Civil War industrialist William Gregg as inspiration\", McCarthy and Pearce spent a year traveling the South to research the subject of industrialization there.[31] McCarthy completed the screenplay in 1976 and the episode, titled The Gardener\\'s Son, aired on January 6, 1977. Numerous film festivals abroad screened it.[32] The episode was nominated for two Primetime Emmy awards in 1977.[31]\\nIn 1979, McCarthy published his semiautobiographical Suttree, which he had written over 20 years before, based on his experiences in Knoxville on the Tennessee River. Jerome Charyn likened it to a doomed Huckleberry Finn, noting how the Yew tree of the author\\'s sprawling Tennessee garden was inspiration for the \"christening of what became the principal character\\'s name.\"[33][34][35]\\nIn 1981, McCarthy was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship worth $236,000. Saul Bellow, Shelby Foote, and others had recommended him to the organization. The grant enabled him to travel the American Southwest to research his next novel, Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West (1985).[23] The book is violent, with The New York Times declaring it the \"bloodiest book since the Iliad\".[30] Although snubbed by many critics, the book has grown appreciably in stature in literary circles; Harold Bloom called Blood Meridian  \"the greatest single book since Faulkner\\'s As I Lay Dying\".[36] In a 2006 poll of authors and publishers conducted by The New York Times Magazine to list the greatest American novels of the previous quarter-century, Blood Meridian placed third, behind Toni Morrison\\'s Beloved (1987) and Don DeLillo\\'s Underworld (1997).[37][38] Some have even suggested it is the Great American Novel.[39] Time included it on their 2005 list of the 100 best English-language books published since 1923.[40] At the time, McCarthy was living in a stone cottage behind an El Paso shopping center, which he described as \"barely habitable\".[12]\\nAs of 1991, none of McCarthy\\'s novels had sold more than 5,000 hardcover copies, and \"for most of his career, he did not even have an agent\". He was labeled the \"best unknown novelist in America\".[30]\\nAfter working with McCarthy for twenty years, Albert Erskine retired from Random House in 1992. McCarthy turned to Alfred A. Knopf, where he fell under the editorial advisement of Gary Fisketjon. As a final favor to Erskine, McCarthy agreed to his first interview ever, with Richard B. Woodward of The New York Times.[10]\\nMcCarthy finally received widespread recognition following the publication of All the Pretty Horses (1992), when it won the National Book Award[41] and the National Book Critics Circle Award. It became a New York Times bestseller, selling 190,000 hardcover copies within six months.[10] It was followed by The Crossing (1994) and Cities of the Plain (1998), completing the Border Trilogy.[42]\\nIn the midst of this trilogy came The Stonemason (first performed in 1995), his second dramatic work.[43][44]\\nMcCarthy originally conceived his next work, No Country for Old Men (2005),[note 1] as a screenplay before turning it into a novel.[46] Consequently, the novel has little description of setting and is composed largely of dialogue.[1] A western set in the 1980s,[47] No Country for Old Men was adapted by the Coen brothers into a 2007 film of the same name, which won four Academy Awards and more than 75 film awards globally.[46]\\nIn the early 2000s while staying at an El Paso motel with his young son, McCarthy looked out the window late one night and imagined what the city might look like in fifty or one hundred years and saw: \"fires up on the hill and everything being laid to waste\".[15] He wrote two pages covering the idea; four years later in Ireland he expanded the idea into his tenth novel, The Road. It follows a lone father and his young son traveling through a post-apocalyptic America, hunted by cannibals.[note 2] Many of the discussions between the two were verbatim conversations McCarthy had had with his son.[15][49] Released in 2006, it won international acclaim and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.[46] McCarthy did not accept the prize in person, instead sending Sonny Mehta in his place.[50] John Hillcoat directed the 2009 film adaptation, written by Joe Penhall, and starring Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee. Critics\\' reviews were mostly favorable: Roger Ebert found it \"powerful\" but lacking \"emotional feeling\",[51] Peter Bradshaw noted \"a guarded change of emphasis\",[52] while Dan Jolin found it to be a \"faithful adaptation\" of the \"devastating novel\".[53]\\nMcCarthy published the play The Sunset Limited in 2006. Critics noted it was unorthodox and may have had more in common with a novel, hence McCarthy\\'s subtitle: \"a novel in dramatic form\".[54][55] He later adapted it into a screenplay for a 2011 film, directed and executive produced by Tommy Lee Jones, who also starred opposite Samuel L. Jackson.[55][54]\\nOprah Winfrey selected McCarthy\\'s The Road as the April 2007 selection for her Book Club.[1][56] As a result, McCarthy agreed to his first television interview, which aired on The Oprah Winfrey Show on June 5, 2007. The interview took place in the library of the Santa Fe Institute. McCarthy told Winfrey that he did not know any writers and much preferred the company of scientists. During the interview, he related several stories illustrating the degree of outright poverty he endured at times during his career as a writer. He also spoke about the experience of fathering a child at an advanced age, and how his son was the inspiration for The Road.[57]\\nIn 2012, McCarthy sold his original screenplay The Counselor to Nick Wechsler, Paula Mae Schwartz, and Steve Schwartz, who had previously produced the film adaptation of McCarthy\\'s novel The Road.[58] Directed by Ridley Scott, with the production finished in 2012, the film was released on October 25, 2013, to polarized critical reception. Mark Kermode of The Guardian found it \"datedly naff\",[59] and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described it as \"a droning meditation on capitalism\".[60] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times found it \"terrifying\" and \"seductive\".[61]\\nMcCarthy was a trustee for the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), a multidisciplinary research center devoted to the study of complex adaptive systems.[62] Unlike most members of the SFI, McCarthy did not have a scientific background. As Murray Gell-Mann explained, \"There isn\\'t any place like the Santa Fe Institute, and there isn\\'t any writer like Cormac, so the two fit quite well together.\"[23] From his work at the Santa Fe Institute, McCarthy published his first piece of nonfiction writing in his 50-year writing career. In the essay entitled \"The Kekulé Problem\" (2017), McCarthy analyzes a dream of August Kekulé\\'s as a model of the unconscious mind and the origins of language. He theorizes about the nature of the unconscious mind and its separation from human language. The unconscious, according to McCarthy, \"is a machine for operating an animal\" and \"all animals have an unconscious\". McCarthy postulates that language is a purely human cultural creation and not a biologically determined phenomenon.[63]\\nIn 2015, McCarthy\\'s next novel, The Passenger, was announced at a multimedia event hosted in Santa Fe by the Lannan Foundation. The book was influenced by his time among scientists; it has been described by SFI biologist David Krakauer as \"full-blown Cormac 3.0—a mathematical [and] analytical novel\". In March 2022, The New York Times reported that The Passenger would be released on October 25, 2022, and a second companion novel, Stella Maris, on November 22.[6] The latter was McCarthy\\'s first novel since Outer Dark to feature a female protagonist.[26]\\nAt the time of his death, McCarthy was listed as an executive producer on a film adaption of Blood Meridian, to be directed by John Hillcoat, who previously directed the film adaptation of The Road.[64]\\nHe left the beer on the counter and went out and got the two packs of cigarettes and the binoculars and the pistol and slung the .270 over his shoulder and shut the truck door and came back in.\\n—Cormac McCarthy\\'s polysyndetic use of \"and\" in No Country for Old MenMcCarthy used punctuation sparsely, even replacing most commas with \"and\" to create polysyndetons;[65] it has been called \"the most important word in McCarthy\\'s lexicon\".[1] He told Oprah Winfrey that he preferred \"simple declarative sentences\" and that he used capital letters, periods, an occasional comma, or a colon for setting off a list, but never semicolons, which he labeled as \"idiocy\".[23][66] He did not use quotation marks for dialogue and believed there is no reason to \"blot the page up with weird little marks\".[67] Erik Hage notes that McCarthy\\'s dialogue often lacks attribution, but that \"somehow\\xa0... the reader remains oriented as to who is speaking.\"[68] His attitude to punctuation dated to some editing work he did for a professor of English while enrolled at the University of Tennessee; he stripped out much of the punctuation in the book being edited, which pleased the professor.[69] McCarthy edited fellow Santa Fe Institute Fellow W. Brian Arthur\\'s influential article \"Increasing Returns and the New World of Business\", published in the Harvard Business Review in 1996, removing commas from the text.[70] He also copy edited work for physicists Lawrence M. Krauss and Lisa Randall.[71]\\nSaul Bellow praised his \"absolutely overpowering use of language, his life-giving and death-dealing sentences\".[72] Richard B. Woodward has described his writing as \"reminiscent of early Hemingway\".[12] Unlike earlier works such as Suttree and Blood Meridian, the majority of McCarthy\\'s work after 1993 uses simple, restrained vocabulary.[1]\\nThere\\'s no such thing as life without bloodshed. The notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is a really dangerous idea. Those who are afflicted with this notion are the first ones to give up their souls, their freedom. Your desire that it be that way will enslave you and make your life vacuous.\\nCormac McCarthy, interviewed in the New York Times (April 19, 1992)[73]McCarthy\\'s novels often depict explicit violence.[15] Many of his works have been characterized as nihilistic,[74] particularly Blood Meridian.[75] Some academics dispute this, saying Blood Meridian is actually a gnostic tragedy.[76][77] His later works have been characterized as highly moralistic. Erik J. Wielenberg argues that The Road depicts morality as secular and originating from individuals, such as the father, and separate from God.[78]\\nThe bleak outlook of the future, and the inhuman foreign antagonist Anton Chigurh of No Country for Old Men, is said to reflect the apprehension of the post-9/11 era.[79] Many of his works portray individuals in conflict with society and acting on instinct rather than on emotion or thought.[80] Another theme throughout many of McCarthy\\'s works is the ineptitude or inhumanity of those in authority and particularly in law enforcement. This is seen in Blood Meridian with the murder spree the Glanton Gang initiates because of the bounties, the \"overwhelmed\" law enforcement in No Country for Old Men, and the corrupt police officers in All the Pretty Horses.[81] As a result, he has been labeled the \"great pessimist of American literature\".[15]\\nMcCarthy was fluent in Spanish, having lived in Ibiza, Spain, in the 1960s and later residing in El Paso, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.[82] Isabel Soto argues that after he learned the language, in his novels \"Spanish and English modulate or permeate each other\", as it was \"an essential part of McCarthy\\'s expressive discourse\".[83] Katherine Sugg observes that McCarthy\\'s writing is \"often considered a \\'multicultural\\' and \\'bilingual\\' narrative practice, particularly for its abundant use of untranslated Spanish dialogue\".[84] Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observes, \"John Grady Cole is a native speaker of Spanish. This is also the case of several other important characters in the Border Trilogy, including Billy Parhnam  [sic], John Grady\\'s mother (and possibly his grandfather and brothers), and perhaps Jimmy Blevins, each of whom are speakers of Spanish who were ostensibly born in the US political space into families with what are generally considered English-speaking surnames\\xa0... This is also the case of Judge Holden in Blood Meridian.\"[82]\\nMcCarthy dedicated himself to writing full time, choosing not to work other jobs to support his career. \"I always knew that I didn\\'t want to work\", McCarthy said. \"You have to be dedicated, but it was my number-one priority.\"[86] Early in his career, his decision not to work sometimes subjected him and his family to poverty.[57]\\nNevertheless, according to scholar Steve Davis, McCarthy had an \"incredible work ethic\".[87] He preferred to work on several projects simultaneously and said, for instance, that he had four drafts in progress in the mid-2000s and for several years devoted about two hours every day to each project.[85] He was known to conduct exhaustive research on the historical settings and regional environments found in his fiction.[88] He edited his own writing, sometimes revising a book over the course of years or decades before deeming it fit for publication.[87] While his research and revision were meticulous, he did not outline his plots and instead viewed writing as a \"subconscious process\" which should be given space for spontaneous inspiration.[17]\\nAfter 1958, McCarthy wrote all of his literary work and correspondence with a mechanical typewriter. He originally used a Royal but went looking for a more lightweight machine ahead of a trip to Europe in the early 1960s. He bought a portable Olivetti Lettera 32 for $50 at a Knoxville pawn shop and typed about five million words over the next five decades. He maintained it by simply \"blowing out the dust with a service station hose\". Book dealer Glenn Horowitz said the modest typewriter acquired \"a sort of talismanic quality\" through its connection to McCarthy\\'s monumental fiction, \"as if Mount Rushmore was carved with a Swiss Army knife\".[85] His Olivetti was auctioned in December 2009 at Christie\\'s, with the auction house estimating it would fetch between $15,000 and $20,000. It sold for $254,500, with proceeds donated to the Santa Fe Institute.[89] McCarthy replaced it with an identical model, bought for him by his friend John Miller for $11 plus $19.95 for shipping.[85]\\nMcCarthy was a teetotaler. According to Richard B. Woodward, \"McCarthy doesn\\'t drink anymore – he quit 16 years ago [i.e. in 1976] in El Paso, with one of his young girlfriends – and Suttree reads like a farewell to that life. \\'The friends I do have are simply those who quit drinking,\\' he says. \\'If there is an occupational hazard to writing, it\\'s drinking\\'.\"[73] However, McCarthy\\'s mistress Augusta Britt claimed that he had resumed drinking near the end of his life.[90]\\nIn the 1980s, McCarthy and Edward Abbey considered covertly releasing wolves into southern Arizona to restore their decimated population.[91]\\nIn the late 1990s, McCarthy moved to Tesuque, New Mexico, north of Santa Fe, with his third wife, Jennifer Winkley, and their son, John. McCarthy and Winkley divorced in 2006.[23]\\nIn 2013, Scottish writer Michael Crossan created a Twitter account impersonating McCarthy, quickly amassing several thousand followers and recognition by former site owner Jack Dorsey. Five hours after the account\\'s creation, McCarthy\\'s publisher confirmed that the account was fake and that McCarthy did not own a computer.[92] In 2018, another account impersonating McCarthy was created. In 2021, it was briefly marked verified following a viral tweet, after which his agent confirmed that the account was again a fake.[93][94]\\nIn 2016, a hoax spread on Twitter claiming that McCarthy had died, with USA Today even repeating the information.[95][96] The Los Angeles Times responded to the hoax with the headline, \"Cormac McCarthy isn\\'t dead. He\\'s too tough to die.\"[97]\\nIn 2024, Vanity Fair published an article claiming that McCarthy had maintained a relationship with Augusta Britt. They met when he was 42 and when she was 16. He took her to Mexico with a forged birth certificate and began having sex with her when she was still 17. Britt has denied that the relationship was predatory or abusive.[98][99]\\nMcCarthy did not publicly reveal his political opinions.[100] A resident of Santa Fe with a traditionalist disposition, he once expressed disapproval of the city and the people there: \"If you don\\'t agree with them politically, you can\\'t just agree to disagree—they think you\\'re crazy.\"[23] Academic David Holloway writes that \"McCarthy\\'s writing can be read as either liberal or conservative, or as both simultaneously, depending on the politics that readers themselves bring with them to the act of reading the work\".[101]\\nIn one of his few interviews, McCarthy revealed that he respected only authors who \"deal with issues of life and death\", citing Henry James and Marcel Proust as examples of writers who do not. \"I don\\'t understand them\\xa0... To me, that\\'s not literature. A lot of writers who are considered good I consider strange\", he said.[30] \\nRegarding his own literary constraints when writing novels, McCarthy said he was \"not a fan of some of the Latin American writers, magical realism. You know, it\\'s hard enough to get people to believe what you\\'re telling them without making it impossible. It has to be vaguely plausible.\"[102] He cited Moby-Dick (1851) as his favorite novel.[23] Along with Moby-Dick, McCarthy regarded The Brothers Karamazov (1880), Ulysses (1922), and The Sound and the Fury (1929) as \"great\" novels.[17]\\nSocially, McCarthy had an aversion to other writers, preferring the company of scientists. He voiced his admiration for scientific advances: \"What physicists did in the 20th century was one of the extraordinary flowerings ever in the human enterprise.\"[23] At MacArthur reunions, McCarthy shunned his fellow writers to fraternize instead with scientists like physicist Murray Gell-Mann and whale biologist Roger Payne. Of all of his interests, McCarthy stated, \"Writing is way, way down at the bottom of the list.\"[30]\\nMcCarthy died at his home in Santa Fe on June 13, 2023, at the age of 89.[103][104][105][106] Stephen King said McCarthy was \"maybe the greatest American novelist of my time ... He was full of years and created a fine body of work, but I still mourn his passing.\"[107]\\nIn 2003, literary critic Harold Bloom named McCarthy as one of the four major living American novelists, alongside Don DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon, and Philip Roth.[108] Bloom\\'s 1994 book The Western Canon had listed Child of God, Suttree, and Blood Meridian among the works of contemporary literature he predicted would endure and become \"canonical\".[109] Bloom reserved his highest praise for Blood Meridian, which he called \"the greatest single book since Faulkner\\'s As I Lay Dying\", and though he held less esteem for McCarthy\\'s other novels he said that \"to have written even one book so authentically strong and allusive, and capable of the perpetual reverberation that Blood Meridian possesses more than justifies him.\\xa0... He has attained genius with that book.\"[110]\\nA comprehensive archive of McCarthy\\'s personal papers is preserved at the Wittliff Collections, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas. The McCarthy papers consists of 98 boxes (46 linear feet).[111] The acquisition of the Cormac McCarthy Papers resulted from years of ongoing conversations between McCarthy and Southwestern Writers Collection founder, Bill Wittliff, who negotiated the proceedings.[112] The Southwestern Writers Collection/Wittliff Collections also holds The Woolmer Collection of Cormac McCarthy, which consists of letters between McCarthy and bibliographer J. Howard Woolmer,[113] and four other related collections.[113][114]\\nNovels\\n',\n",

       "  'Thomas Francis McGuane III (born December 11, 1939) is an American writer. His work includes ten novels, short fiction and screenplays, as well as three collections of essays devoted to his life in the outdoors. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters,[1] the National Cutting Horse Association Members Hall of Fame[2] and the Fly Fishing Hall of Fame.[3] McGuane\\'s papers, manuscripts, and correspondence are located in the Montana State University Archives and Special Collections and are available for research use. In 2023, he was given the first Award for Excellence in Service to the MSU Library for the advancement of scholarship and access to unique materials.[4]\\nMcGuane\\'s early novels were noted for a comic appreciation for the irrational core of many human endeavors, multiple takes on the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s. His later writing reflected an increasing devotion to family relationships and relationships with the natural world in the changing American West, primarily Montana, where he has made his home since 1968, and where his last five novels and many of his essays are set. He has three children, Annie, Maggie and Thomas.\\nMcGuane was born in Wyandotte, Michigan, the son of Irish Catholic parents who moved to the Midwest from Massachusetts. His primary education included boarding school at Cranbrook School, but also included work on a ranch in Wyoming, and fishing and hunting. A difficult relationship with his alcoholic father would later shadow much of his fiction. McGuane prefers to consider his roots matrilineal, on which he is descended from a rich storytelling clan.[5]\\nHe envisioned himself as a writer from a very young age, admiring what he perceived as the adventurous life of a writer as much as the prospect of writing. When he was ten years old, he got into a physical altercation with a friend over differing descriptions of a sunset. He began a serious devotion to writing by the age of 16.[5]\\nAfter briefly attending the University of Michigan and University of Olivet, McGuane graduated from Michigan State University, where he received a BA in English in 1962 and met the writer Jim Harrison.[6] He and Harrison became lifelong friends, bonding over a love for nature. At the Yale School of Drama, where he obtained an MFA in 1965, he studied playwriting and dramatic literature. A Stegner Fellowship to Stanford University in 1966–67 allowed him to finish his first published novel, The Sporting Club, published in 1969.[5]\\nUpon completing his Stegner Fellowship, McGuane and his first wife, Rebecca Portia Crockett, began to divide their time between Livingston, Montana, and Key West, Florida. When the screen rights to The Sporting Club were purchased, he bought ranch property in Montana\\'s Paradise Valley. His second novel, The Bushwhacked Piano, appeared in 1971. Jonathan Yardley in The New York Times called McGuane \"a talent of Faulknerian potential,\" while Saul Bellow described McGuane as \"a language star.\" The novel won the Rosenthal Award of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.[5]\\nMcGuane\\'s third novel, Ninety-Two in the Shade (1973), is perhaps his best known. It was nominated for a National Book Award.\\nIn 1973, he crashed his Porsche on an icy Texas highway. While not seriously injured, he was left speechless for several days.[7]\\nHe reassessed his career and changed his focus to Hollywood\\'s lucrative screenwriting opportunities. He entered a period where he became known as \"Captain Berserko\" and wrote screenplays for Rancho Deluxe (1975),[8] shot in Livingston; The Missouri Breaks (1976), directed by Arthur Penn and starring Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando; and self-directing a film adaptation of 92 in the Shade (1975), starring Peter Fonda, Warren Oates, Margot Kidder and Harry Dean Stanton.[8]\\nThe early 1970s included an affair with actress Elizabeth Ashley, divorce from first wife Becky (who went on to marry Peter Fonda), marriage to actress Margot Kidder, the birth of their daughter, Maggie, and his second divorce—all in less than a year.[5]\\nMcGuane published his most autobiographical novel, Panama, in 1978. The character Catherine was said to be a literary embodiment of McGuane\\'s third wife, Laurie Buffett, sister of Jimmy Buffett, one of McGuane\\'s Key West comrades. With the exception of positive reviews in The New Yorker and The Village Voice, the novel was mercilessly panned by critics as self-absorbed and a testament to wasted literary talent—notwithstanding McGuane\\'s protests that he considered it his best novel.[5]\\nAn ongoing struggle ensued between McGuane and his reviewers concerning their expectations for his fiction, and their sense of how much McGuane\\'s celebrity was intruding upon his work. The upheaval of the period concluded with the deaths of McGuane\\'s father, mother, and sister in the span of 30 months.[5]\\nMcGuane was presented the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement by Council member David McCullough at the 1993 Academy of Achievement Summit in Glacier National Park, Montana.[5] In 1993 McGuane received an honorary doctorate from Montana State University.[9]\\nMcGuane won the 2016 Robert Kirsch Award for lifetime achievement from the Los Angeles Times, was a finalist for the National Magazine Award in 2013 for his story \"River Camp\",[5] and was a finalist for the Frank O\\'Connor Award in 2015 for his work \"Gallatin Canyon\".[10]\\nIn 2018, he appeared in conversation with Richard Powers at the New York Public Library.[11] In 2024 he appeared in a film about his time spent fishing and writing in the Florida Keys with other notable writers such as Jim Harrison, Richard Brautigan, Russell Chatham, and Jimmy Buffett.[12]\\nAfter Panama, McGuane\\'s novels changed considerably. Beginning with Nobody\\'s Angel in 1981, the setting has consistently been in Montana, usually in the fictitious town of “Deadrock” (presumably a play on “Livingston”).[13]\\nHe moved from Paradise Valley to a different property in the Boulder River valley near McLeod, Montana.\\nLarry McMurtry observed that McGuane\\'s nonfiction writing displays a markedly contrasting inner peace and natural spirituality. McGuane\\'s paeans to fly fishing (The Longest Silence), horses (Some Horses) and the outdoors (An Outside Chance) capture his belief in the redemptive potential of nature and sporting ritual.[14]\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nLarry Jeff McMurtry (June 3, 1936\\xa0– March 25, 2021) was an American novelist, essayist, and screenwriter whose work was predominantly set in either the Old West or contemporary Texas.[1] His novels included Horseman, Pass By (1962), The Last Picture Show (1966), and Terms of Endearment (1975), which were adapted into films. Films adapted from McMurtry\\'s works earned 34 Oscar nominations (13 wins). He was also a prominent book collector and bookseller.\\nHis 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Lonesome Dove was adapted into a television miniseries that earned 18 Emmy Award nominations (seven wins). The subsequent three novels in his Lonesome Dove series were adapted as three more miniseries, earning eight more Emmy nominations. McMurtry and co-writer Diana Ossana adapted the screenplay for Brokeback Mountain (2005), which earned eight Academy Award nominations with three wins, including McMurtry and Ossana for Best Adapted Screenplay. In 2014, McMurtry received the National Humanities Medal.[2]\\nIn Tracy Daugherty\\'s 2023 biography of McMurtry, the biographer quotes critic Dave Hickey as saying about McMurtry: \"Larry is a writer, and it\\'s kind of like being a critter.  If you leave a cow alone, he\\'ll eat grass.  If you leave Larry alone, he\\'ll write books.  When he\\'s in public, he may say hello and goodbye, but otherwise he is just resting, getting ready to go write.\"[3]\\nMcMurtry\\'s birth certificate states that he was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, the son of Hazel Ruth (née McIver) and William Jefferson McMurtry.[4] He grew up on his parents\\' ranch outside Archer City, Texas. The city was the model for the town of Thalia which is a setting for much of his fiction.[5] He earned a BA from the University of North Texas in 1958 and an MA from Rice University in 1960.[6][7]\\nIn his memoir, McMurtry said that during his first five or six years in his grandfather\\'s ranch house, there were no books, but his extended family would sit on the front porch every night and tell stories. In 1942, McMurtry\\'s cousin Robert Hilburn stopped by the ranch house on his way to enlist for World War II, and left a box containing 19 boys\\' adventure books from the 1930s. The first book he read was Sergeant Silk: The Prairie Scout.[8]\\nDuring the 1960–1961 academic year, McMurtry was a Wallace Stegner Fellow at the Stanford University Creative Writing Center, where he studied the craft of fiction under Frank O\\'Connor and Malcolm Cowley,[9] alongside other aspiring writers, including Wendell Berry, Ken Kesey, Peter S.

(Wallace Stegner was on sabbatical in Europe during McMurtry\\'s fellowship year.[10])\\nMcMurtry and Kesey remained friends after McMurtry left California and returned to Texas to take a year-long composition instructorship at Texas Christian University.[11] In 1963, he returned to Rice University, where he served as a lecturer in English until 1969, and a visiting professor at George Mason College (1970) and American University (1970–71).[12] He entertained some of his early students with accounts of Hollywood and the filming of Hud, for which he was consulting. In 1964, Kesey and his Merry Pranksters conducted their noted cross-country trip, stopping at McMurtry\\'s home in Houston. The adventure in the day-glo-painted school bus Furthur was chronicled by Tom Wolfe in his book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. That same year, McMurtry was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.[13]\\nMcMurtry won numerous awards from the Texas Institute of Letters: three times the Jesse H. Jones Award—in 1962, for Horseman, Pass By; in 1967, for The Last Picture Show, which he shared with Tom Pendleton\\'s The Iron Orchard; and in 1986, for Lonesome Dove. He won the Amon G. Carter award for periodical prose in 1966 for Texas: Good Times Gone or Here Again?[14] and the Lon Tinkle Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1984.[15] In 1986, McMurtry received the annual Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award from the Tulsa Library Trust.[16] He reflected on his 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Lonesome Dove, in Literary Life: A Second Memoir (2009), writing that it was the \"Gone With the Wind of the West … a pretty good book; it\\'s not a towering masterpiece.\"[17]\\nMcMurtry described his method for writing novels in Books: A Memoir. He said that from his first novel on, he would get up early and dash off five pages of narrative. When he published the memoir in 2008, he said this was still his method, although by then, he wrote 10 pages a day. He also wrote every day, ignoring holidays and weekends.[18] McMurtry was a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books.[19]\\nMcMurtry was a vigorous defender of free speech and, while serving as president of PEN American Center (now PEN America) from 1989 to 1991, led the organization\\'s efforts to support writer Salman Rushdie,[20] whose novel The Satanic Verses (1988) caused a major controversy among some Muslims, with the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issuing a fatwā calling for Rushdie\\'s assassination, after which attempts were made on his life.[21]\\nIn 1989, McMurtry testified on behalf of PEN America before the U.S. Congress in opposition to immigration rules in the 1952 McCarran–Walter Act that for decades permitted the visa denial and deportation of foreign writers for ideological reasons.[17] He recounted how before PEN America was to host the 1986 International PEN Congress, \"there was a serious question as to whether such a meeting could in fact take place in this country... the McCarran–Walter Act could have effectively prevented such a gathering in the United States.\" He denounced the relevant rules as \"an affront to all who cherish the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and association. To a writer whose living depends upon the uninhibited interchange of ideas and experiences, these provisions are especially appalling.\" Subsequently, some provisions that excluded certain classes of immigrants based on their political beliefs were revoked by the Immigration Act of 1990.[22]\\nWhile at Stanford, McMurtry became a rare-book scout.[23] During his years in Houston, he managed a book store called the Bookman. In 1969, he moved to the Washington, D.C., area. In 1970 with two partners, he started a bookshop in Georgetown, which he named Booked Up. In 1988, he opened another Booked Up in Archer City. It became one of the largest antiquarian bookstores in the United States, carrying between 400,000 and 450,000 titles. Citing economic pressures from Internet bookselling, McMurtry came close to shutting down the Archer City store in 2005, but chose to keep it open after great public support.\\nIn early 2012, McMurtry decided to downsize and sell off the greater portion of his inventory. He felt the collection was a liability for his heirs.[24] The auction was conducted on August 10 and 11, 2012, and was overseen by Addison and Sarova Auctioneers of Macon, Georgia. This epic book auction sold books by the shelf, and was billed as \"The Last Booksale\", in keeping with the title of McMurtry\\'s The Last Picture Show. Dealers, collectors, and gawkers came out en masse from all over the country to witness this historic auction. As stated by McMurtry on the weekend of the sale, \"I\\'ve never seen that many people lined up in Archer City, and I\\'m sure I never will again.\"[25]\\nIn April 2006, McMurtry was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.[26]\\nMcMurtry became well known for the film adaptations of his work, which were seen by many viewers, especially Hud (from the novel Horseman, Pass By), starring Paul Newman and Patricia Neal;[27] the Peter Bogdanovich–directed The Last Picture Show;[28] James L. Brooks\\'s Terms of Endearment, which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture (1984);[29] and Lonesome Dove, which became a popular television miniseries starring Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall.[30][31]\\nIn 2006, he was co-winner (with Diana Ossana) of both the Best Screenplay Golden Globe[32] and the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Brokeback Mountain, adapted from a short story by E. Annie Proulx. He accepted his Oscar while wearing a dinner jacket over jeans and cowboy boots.[33]  In his speech, he promoted books, reminding the audience the movie was developed from a short story. In his Golden Globe acceptance speech, he paid tribute to his Swiss-made Hermes 3000 typewriter.[34]\\nMcMurtry married Jo Scott, an English professor who has authored five books.[35] Before divorcing, they had a son together, James McMurtry. Both James and his own son, Curtis McMurtry, are singer/songwriters and guitarists.[36]\\nIn 1991 McMurtry underwent heart surgery.[37] During his recovery, he suffered severe depression. He recovered at the home of his future writing partner Diana Ossana and wrote his novel Streets of Laredo at her kitchen counter.[38][39]\\nMcMurtry married Norma Faye Kesey, the widow of writer Ken Kesey, on April 29, 2011, in a civil ceremony in Archer City.[40]\\nMcMurtry died on March 25, 2021, at his home in Archer City, Texas. He was 84 years old.[41]\\nIt was announced in early 2023 that McMurtry\\'s personal property including his writing desk, typewriters and personal book collection would be sold at public auction by Vogt Auction in San Antonio, Texas, on May 29, 2023.[42]\\nLarry McMurtry\\'s first three novels, all set in the north Texas town of Thalia following World War II.\\nThe books follow the story of mother/daughter characters Harmony and Pepper.\\nThe books follow the story of character Duane Moore.\\nThe books follow the stories of occasionally recurring characters living in the Houston, Texas, area.\\n',\n",

       "  'Cincinnatus Heine Miller[a] (/ˌsɪnsɪˈneɪtəs ˈhaɪnə/ SIN-sin-AY-təs HY-nə; September 8, 1837 – February 17, 1913), better known by his pen name Joaquin Miller (/hwɑːˈkiːn/ whah-KEEN), was an American poet, author, and frontiersman. He became known as the \"Poet of the Sierras\" after the Sierra Nevada, about which he wrote in his Songs of the Sierras (1871).\\nJoaquin Miller\\'s parents were Hulings Miller and Margaret (née Witt), who married January 3, 1836, in Union County, Indiana.[1] Their second son, Cincinnatus Hiner Miller, was born in 1837 near Union County, Indiana.[2][3] For unknown reasons, Miller later claimed his birth date was November 10, 1841.[4] He said he was born in Millersville, Indiana, a town he claimed was founded by his father, while on a wagon heading west.[5] After leaving Union County, Miller\\'s father then moved the family to Grant County, Indiana to a location near the Mississinewa River and near the Miami Indian Reservation.[6] Besides adopting the pen name \"Joaquin\", he later changed his middle name from Hiner to Heine to evoke the German poet Heinrich Heine.[7]\\nWhile Miller was a young boy, probably between 1850 and 1852,[8] his family moved to Oregon and settled in the Willamette Valley, establishing a farm in what would become Lane County.\\nAs a young man, he moved to northern California during the California Gold Rush years, and had a variety of adventures, including spending a year living in a Native American village, and being wounded in a battle with Native Americans. A number of his popular works, Life Amongst the Modocs,[9] An Elk Hunt,[10] and The Battle of Castle Crags, draw on these experiences. He was wounded in the cheek and neck with an arrow during this latter battle, recuperating at the Gold Rush-era mining town of Portuguese Flat.\\nHe accompanied William Walker on the latter\\'s 1855 filibustering expedition to Nicaragua.[11][12] In the spring of 1857, Miller took part in an expedition against the Pit River Tribe after they killed a white man on Pit River.[13] Years later, he claimed that he had sided with the Native Americans and was run out of town for it.[14] He was widely rumored to have married an Indian woman, possibly a Wintu woman who nursed him back to health after he was wounded by Modocs, and to have fathered with her a daughter named Cali-Shasta, or \"Lily of the Shasta.\"[15] Although Miller soon left the area to pursue other adventures, in the 1870s he sought out Cali-Shasta, then in her teens, and took her to San Francisco to be educated by his friend Ina Coolbrith.[16] Contemporaries believed that Miller\\'s \"Indian wife\" was the woman later kidnapped by Modocs and held in captivity for some years until rescued by a man named Jim Brock (whom she married), but when \"Amanda Brock\" died in 1909, Miller denied news reports describing his supposed romance with her. He credited her with saving his life, but said she had always been a platonic friend.[17][18]\\nSpending a short time in the mining camps of northern Idaho, Miller found his way to Canyon City, Oregon by 1864 where he was elected the third Judge of Grant County. His old cabin in Canyon City is still standing.\\nMiller\\'s exploits included a variety of occupations: mining-camp cook (who came down with scurvy from only eating what he cooked), lawyer and a judge, newspaper writer, Pony Express rider, and horse thief. On July 10, 1859, Miller was caught stealing a horse gelding valued at $80, a saddle worth $15, and other items.[19] He was jailed briefly in Shasta County for the crime, and various accounts give other incidents of his repeating this crime in California and Oregon.\\nMiller earned an estimated $3,000 working as a Pony Express rider, and used the money to move to Oregon. With the help of his friend, Senator Joseph Lane, he became editor of the Democratic Register in Eugene,[20] a role he held from March 15 to September 20, 1862.[21] Though no copies survive, it was known as sympathetic to the Confederacy until it was forced to shut down[22] because of its treasonable character.[11] That year, Miller married Theresa Dyer on September 12, 1862, in her home four days after meeting her[23] in Port Orford, Oregon. He had corresponded with her after exchanging poems with her for critique and chasing away a competing suitor.[24] She published poetry under the pen name \"Minnie Myrtle\" and later, as Minnie Myrtle Miller.[25] The couple had three children: Maud, George, and Henry, although Miller would later claim the baby Henry was not his own.[citation needed]\\nIn 1868, Miller paid for the publication of 500 copies of his first book of poetry, Specimens.[26] It was unnoticed and Miller gave away more copies than he sold. Few have survived.[27] The author\\'s despair and disappointment was reflected in his second book, Joaquin et al., the next year.[28]\\nDyer filed for divorce on April 4, 1870, claiming they had a third child, Henry Mark, the year before and that Miller was \"wholly\" neglectful.[29] The court declared them divorced on April 19 and Dyer was granted custody of the baby while the two older children were left in the care of her mother. Miller was ordered to pay $200 per year in child support.[30] Miller believed the divorce prevented him from being nominated for a seat on the Oregon Supreme Court.[31] He never denied her charges that he was neglectful of her and their children and was rarely home.[32] He also may have had an affair with actress Adah Isaacs Menken shortly into the marriage.[33]\\nMiller had sent a copy of Joaquin, et al. to Bret Harte, who offered advice that he avoid \"faults of excess\" and encouragingly wrote, \"you are on your way to become a poet.\"[34] The next summer, July 1870, Miller traveled to San Francisco with borrowed money and there befriended Charles Warren Stoddard and Ina Coolbrith. Stoddard was the first to meet him at the dock and, as he recalled, Miller\\'s first words to him were, \"Well, let us go and talk with the poets.\"[35]\\nMiller went to England, where he was celebrated as a frontier oddity. There, in May 1871, Miller published Songs of the Sierras, the book which finalized his nickname as the \"Poet of the Sierras\".[36] It was well received by the British press and members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, particularly Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti.\\nWhile in England, he was one of the few Americans invited into the Savage Club along with Julian Hawthorne, son of Nathaniel Hawthorne. The younger Hawthorne referred to Miller as \"a licensed libertine\" but admitted to finding him \"charming, amiable, and harmless\".[37] Rather abruptly, Miller left England in September 1871 and landed in New York. At the encouragement of family, he made his way to Easton, Pennsylvania to visit his dying brother before returning to Oregon; his father died shortly thereafter. Miller eventually settled in California, where he grew fruit and published his poems and other works.\\nIn 1877, Miller adapted his First Fam\\'lies of the Sierras into a play, The Danites, or, the Heart of the Sierras. It opened on August 22 in New York with McKee Rankin as the main character.[38] The anti-Mormon play, which featured Danites hunting the daughter of one of the murderers of Joseph Smith, became one of the most commercially successful in a series of anti-Mormon dramas at the time. The Spirit of the Times, however, attributed its success to curious audience members expecting a disastrous failure and instead discovering a good show: \"The play proved to possess more than ordinary merit, and if it is not a great work, it is decidedly not a very bad one.\"[39] The Danites was extended from a run of only a few days to one of seven straight weeks before moving to another theatre and, ultimately, was performed to such a degree that it rivaled the popularity of Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin.[40] It was published in book form later in 1877.[41] Miller later admitted that he regretted the anti-Mormon tone.[42]\\nMiller married for a third time on September 8, 1879 to Abigail Leland, in New York City.\\nIn 1886, Miller published The Destruction of Gotham, a book which was one of the earliest to depict a prostitute as a heroine.[5] That year, he moved to Oakland, California, and built a home for himself he nicknamed \"The Abbey\" on property he called \"The Hights\"  [sic]. He remained there until his death in 1913.[43]\\nJapanese poet Yone Noguchi came to The Hights in 1894 and spent the next four years there as an unpaid laborer in exchange for room and board. While living there, he published his first book, Seen or Unseen; or, Monologues of a Homeless Snail (1897). Though he referred to Miller as \"the most natural man\", Noguchi reflected on those years as his most difficult in the United States and later fictionalized his experience in The American Diary of a Japanese Girl.[44]\\nIn 1897, Miller traveled to the Yukon as a newspaper correspondent.[45] He saw Alaska for the first time on July 30.[46] His dispatches, many of which were written before reaching Alaska, incorrectly implied an easy and inexpensive trip. Miller himself nearly froze to death; two toes were lost to frostbite.[47]\\nMiller died on February 17, 1913, surrounded by friends and family. His last words were recorded as \"Take me away; take me away!\"[41] The poet had asked to be cremated by friends in the funeral pyre he built at The Hights with no religious ceremony and without being embalmed. His wishes were mostly ignored and the funeral on February 19 drew thousands of curious onlookers.[48] The preacher who spoke referred to Miller as \"the last of America\\'s great poets.\"[49] On May 23, members of the Bohemian Club of San Francisco and the Press Club returned to Miller\\'s funeral pyre to burn the urn which contained his ashes, allowing them to scatter. He had left no will and his estate — estimated at $100,000 — was divided between his wife, Abigail and daughter, Juanita.[50]\\nMiller was championed, although not enthusiastically, by Bret Harte and Ambrose Bierce.[citation needed]  In his time, Miller was known for his dishonesty and womanizing. Bierce, his friend and contemporary, said of him, \"In impugning Mr. Miller\\'s veracity, or rather, in plainly declaring that he has none, I should be sorry to be understood as attributing a graver moral delinquency than he really has. He cannot, or will not, tell the truth, but he never tells a malicious or thrifty falsehood.\"[51] Miller\\'s response was, \"I always wondered why God made Bierce.\"[citation needed]\\nCalled the \"Poet of the Sierras\" and the \"Byron of the Rockies\", he may have been more of a celebrity in England than in his native U.S. Much of his reputation, however, came not from his poetry but from the image he created for himself by capitalizing on the stereotypical image of Western frontiersmen.[52] As poet Bayard Taylor bitterly noted in 1876, British audiences \"place the simulated savagery of Joaquin Miller beside the pure and serene muse of Longfellow.\"[53] Critics made much of Miller\\'s poor spelling and rhymes; he once rhymed \"Goethe\" and \"teeth\". Henry Cuyler Bunner satirized the error in a poem titled \"Shake, Mulleary, and Go-ethe\".[54] Miller himself once admitted, \"I\\'m damned if I could tell the difference between a hexameter and a pentameter to save my scalp.\"[55]\\nThe Westminster Review referred to Miller\\'s poetry as \"Whitman without the coarseness\".[56] For a time, Miller\\'s poem \"Columbus\" was one of the most widely known American poems, memorized and recited by legions of schoolchildren. Miller is remembered today, among other reasons, for lines from his poem in honor of \"Burns and Byron\":\\nA historical marker for his birthplace was unveiled October 10, 1915, on U.S. 27 north of Liberty in Union County, Indiana.[57] Joaquin Miller Cabin is located in Washington, DC. The Hights, the Oakland home Miller built at the end of his life, was purchased by the city of Oakland in 1919, and is known as the Joaquin Miller House, located in Joaquin Miller Park.[43] It is a designated California Historical Landmark. He planted the surrounding trees[58] and he personally built, on the eminence to the north, his own funeral pyre and monuments dedicated to Moses, General John C. Frémont, and the poets Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Several schools in California are named for him, including Miller Middle School in San Jose, Joaquin Miller Elementary School in Oakland, and Joaquin Miller Elementary School in Burbank.\\nJoaquin Miller is portrayed by Sean McClory in the Death Valley Days 13th season episode \"Magic Locket\", which portrays Ina Coolbrith and the love of her life.[59]\\nActor George Paulsin portrayed a youthful Joaquin Miller in the Death Valley Days episode \"Early Candle Lighten\", hosted by Dale Robertson. The episode, which aired April 24, 1970, marked Paulsin\\'s first screen appearance and the last of the series\\' 452 episodes. In the story line, a cook at a gold camp in the Arizona Territory faces hanging for stealing nuggets from the miners. His assistant, \"Nat Miller\", played by Paulsin, thinks he can save his life by bringing the cook\\'s sister from Tucson. It was at this gold camp that Miller perfected his penchant for western poetry.[60]\\nIn the 1978 British miniseries Lillie, actor Bruce Boa as Miller startles guests when Lillie Langtry arrives at a ball by scattering rose petals in her path.[61]\\nIn 2012, artist Mark Oliver created a large statue called \"Joaquin\\'s Book\" in Hoo Hoo Park in McCloud, California. The location is near where Miller lived with the Wintus.[62]\\n',\n",
       "  'Heinrich Balduin Möllhausen (27 January 1825—28 May 1905) was a German writer, traveler and artist who visited the United States and participated in three separate expeditions exploring the American frontier. After his travel he became a popular and prolific author of adventure stories based on his experiences in America. It is estimated that he produced at least forty-five large works in 157 volumes (including almost forty novels) and eighty novelettes in twenty-one volumes. His popularity and subject matter earned him recognition as the German Fenimore Cooper.\\nMöllhausen was born near Bonn, Prussia, on 27 January 1825. He was the oldest son of Heinrich Möllhausen, a military officer, and Elisabeth Möllhausen, the Baronesse von Falkenstein.[1] His mother died when he was young and the children were left in the care of relatives while his father traveled about Europe. Financial concerns obligated him to terminate his gymnasium studies in Bonn prematurely. He worked some at agriculture in Pomerania and considered a career in the army but after his experience fighting in the Revolutions of 1848, he left Europe for America in 1849.[2] For the next two years he roamed the frontier in Illinois and Missouri, hunting and occasionally finding work as a sign painter or court clerk.[3]\\nIn 1851 Möllhausen met Duke Paul Wilhelm of Württemberg, a fellow German who was setting out on a scientific expedition to the Rocky Mountains. Möllhausen asked to join the party and was brought along as a scout and draftsman for the journey across the plains to Fort Laramie. They reached the fort without issue but on the trip back they faced numerous difficulties including a prairie fire, hostile Indians and an early winter snowstorm that killed their horses and left them stranded on the prairie. Eventually a mail coach appeared with only enough room to take one of them back to civilization; the duke took the coach leaving Möllhausen  to wait until help could be sent. Möllhausen spent months dealing with hostile Indians, famine, and cold. In early January, 1852 a friendly band of Otoes rescued him and several months later he reached New Orleans for a reunion with the duke.[3]\\nMöllhausen stayed with the duke at his home in New Orleans for a few months and then accepted an offer from the Prussian consul in Saint Louis to accompany a shipment of zoo animals to Berlin. After an absence of nearly four years, Möllhausen returned home in January 1853.[3]\\nThe director of the Berlin Zoo, Hinrich Lichtenstein, introduced Möllhausen to Alexander von Humboldt and they became close friends. Humboldt served as Möllhausen\\'s mentor and patron, encouraging his artistic talents and helping with his first efforts at writing. He also met his future wife, Carolina Alexandra Seifert, who was living at Humboldt\\'s home. Supposedly the daughter of Humboldt\\'s private secretary, there were rumors that Siefert was actually Humboldt\\'s child. In any case, Humboldt showed both Siefert and Möllhausen special favor  and it was his guidance that advanced Möllhausen\\'s intellectual and professional life.[3]\\nAt the urging of Humboldt, Möllhausen returned to America in May 1854, carrying a letter of recommendation from his patron. In Washington D.C. he was hired as a topographer and draftsman for an expedition through the western United States to survey a possible route for a proposed transcontinental railway. Under the leadership of Lieutenant Amiel W. Whipple, the party proceeded from Fort Smith, Arkansas, along the thirty-fifth parallel to southern California. In addition to his work in topography, Möllhausen served as a naturalist and made sketches of landscapes and local inhabitants encountered along the way. Most of the illustrations published in Whipple\\'s report were provided by Möllhausen.[4] By March 1854, they had reached California where the group disbanded and he returned home, reaching Berlin in August 1854.[2][3]\\nIn January 1855 King Frederick William IV provided Möllhausen with a lifetime appointment as custodian of the royal libraries in and around Potsdam, a position that was created at the request of Humboldt. The sinecure left him largely free to pursue his interests in travel and writing. On 6 February 1855 he married Carolina.[2] In 1858 he published his diary of the Whipple expedition, Tagebuch einer Reise vom Mississippi nach den Küsten der Südsee (Diary of a Journey from the Mississippi to the Coasts of the Pacific). The reception of his first book was favorable, especially with the help of Humboldt\\'s active promotion.[3]\\nIn 1857 Lieutenant Joseph Christmas Ives invited Möllhausen to join his expedition to test the navigability of the Colorado River and investigate the Grand Canyon. He accepted the offer and was appointed \"artist and collector in natural history.\" The exploring party assembled in San Francisco in October 1857 and then proceeded to Fort Yuma on the Colorado River. From there they traveled up the Colorado some 530 miles, first in a small steamer built specifically for the trip; and when the river became too shallow, they continued on foot to the Grand Canyon. After exploring the Grand Canyon, they left the river and headed east, reaching Fort Defiance where the expedition ended on May 23, 1858.[5]  Results of their exploration were presented by Ives in Report Upon the Colorado River of the West (1861). The illustrations prepared by Möllhausen for the Ives report were some of the first views of the Grand Canyon ever published.[4]\\nMöllhausen left America for the last time, returning to Germany on September 1, 1858. Using his sketchbooks from the expedition he painted watercolor illustrations that he sent back to Washington for use in Ives\\' report. In 1861 he published an illustrated diary of his last journey, Reisen in die Felsengebirge Nord-Amerikas bis zum Hoch-Plateau von Neu-Mexico (\"Traveling in the Rocky Mountains of North America up to the High Plateau of New Mexico\").[1]\\nFor the next forty-seven years, the first twenty-eight in Potsdam, and after 1886 in Berlin, he devoted himself to writing adventure stories inspired by his experiences in America. His output over a long career was immense, at least forty-five large works in 157 volumes (including almost forty novels) and eighty novelettes in twenty-one volumes. The full extent of his output is hard to estimate—his works were published in newspapers, magazines, and anthologies by a variety of publishers. Despite the fact that America was the central focus of his writings, only his first two travel diaries were ever translated into English.[2][3]\\nMöllhausen\\'s first three novels--Der Halbindianer (\"The Half-Breed\", 1861), Der Flüchtling (\"The Refugee\", 1861), and Der Majordomo (1863)--form a loose trilogy and are set on the American frontier in Missouri, Louisiana, New Mexico, and California: all areas he knew intimately from his previous travels. Der Meerkönig (\"The Sea-King\", 1867) introduced his more typical formula, dividing each plot evenly between the New World and the Old, with Germany, Scotland, and Norway providing the backdrop for the European part of the action. He was an especially popular author in Germany from about 1860 to 1880 and became known as the German Fenimore Cooper.[3]\\nMöllhausen died on 28 May 1905 in Berlin. At his request, he was buried in his old buckskin coat in which he claimed to have spent his happiest hours.\\nA collection of his works was published (1906–13), under title of Illustrierte Romane, Reisen und Abenteuer (“Illustrated novels, travels and adventure”).\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nLorin Morgan-Richards (born February 16, 1975) is an American author, illustrator,[1] and songwriter,[2][3][4] primarily known for his young adult fiction and Gothic Western comedy series The Goodbye Family.[5]\\nIn the past, Richards served as the publisher of Celtic Family Magazine,[6] and was the founder of the Los Angeles St. David\\'s Day Festival,[7][8][9][10] one of the largest Welsh festivals of its kind in the United States.\\nMorgan-Richards was born in Beebetown, Ohio, and is of Swiss (Amish) and Welsh descent.\\nRichards was raised in an old converted one-room schoolhouse in Beebetown, Ohio, that had a well for water. His mother (a student of fine art) taught him the basics of drawing and music composition on the family pump organ. Richards also credited his imagination on the plentiful books his family owned, creative isolation, and the sheer number of animals they took care of, many of which he incorporated into his early drawings and writings.[11]\\nRichards interest in Native American and American Western history began in childhood. \"I remember my first book as a child was The Indians Knew by Tillie S. Pine, an early reader from 1965 explaining the cultural ways and historical resourcefulness of Native Americans and how they are applied in the sciences today.\"[12]\\nWhen Richards entered second grade, he was diagnosed with a form of dyslexia that required tutoring through the ninth grade. By his early teens, he was reading and became inspired by Edward Lear, L. Frank Baum, Roald Dahl, and Lewis Carroll; helping him overcome his reading disability.[13]\\nIn 1990, at the age of 15, Richards wrote and produced his first film entitled The Cowboy Movie.\\nBetween 1993 and 2003, Richards received an AA Degree in Liberal Arts at Cuyahoga Community College and credited his Anthropology Professor Mark Lewine as a mentor. During this time, Richards also achieved minor success in producing music projects containing modern dance and theater, and befriended and collaborated with artist Textbeak. \"I first attended Tri-C Western campus where my focus was on Liberal Arts. At the time, I kept a journal of random thoughts, doodles, and lyrics and used the filter of music as my art. So, the bulk of my classes were in this field of study. I made connections with other artists who shared similar passions, and we were all eager to form various projects of expression. I moved to Lakewood to be closer to the performance spaces and switched to Tri-C Metro where I was awakened out of my shell by an Anthropology teacher named Dr. Mark Lewine.\"[14] In 1999, Richards solo album ENKI and subsequent live production were based on Zecharia Sitchin\\'s book The Twelfth Planet.[15][16][17] The show premiered in Cleveland, Ohio under the choreography of Michael Medcalf. Native American musical act Shouting Mountain opened the evening. In 2001, Richards followed the success of ENKI with the production of An Occurrence Remembered, influenced by the metaphysical war writings of Ambrose Bierce. The performance premiered in New York City.[18][19] Richards reflects on the performance: \"Rehearsals were underway when 9-11 happened and I recall we continued only for our own therapy of the situation, knowing theater-goers were not going out. It was a tremendous performance, but it financially broke me.\"[20]\\nRichards calls his synth music \"Dark Electronic Storytelling\" as it is conceptually based on written works and is meant for dramatic performance.[21]\\nRichards announced on social media in June 2018 that he was re-releasing previous albums and upcoming tracks under the new moniker Elder Moon.[22]\\nIn 2002, Richards moved to Los Angeles to start over where he refocused his artistic direction into writing and illustrating, which he said: \"did not need the expenses of my past but only a pen and paper.\"[23] While his novel Me\\'ma and the Great Mountain (2012) began drafts as early as 2002, it was Simon Snootle and Other Small Stories that became his first book release in 2009.[24][25]\\nThe following year Richards delivered four new releases including his second book of short stories in A Boy Born from Mold and Other Delectable Morsels.\\n\\nRichards conceptualized most of The Goodbye Family characters in 2009 during a trip to the UK and France with his wife, although they were mentioned before this in his western novel Me\\'ma and the Great Mountain. Richards explains \"I took a diary on the trip to write my second novel The Goodbye Family.The Goodbye family consisted of undertakers Otis and Pyridine, their daughter Orphie and her pet tarantula Dorian. Orphie was first seen atop the Notre Dame Cathedral with gargoyles, Otis was trying to board a train at customs with a shrunken head, Pyridine was sewing a limb back together in Cardiff, and Dorian was capturing a fairy to eat. Following these illustrations, a cat Ouiji was unveiled and Orphie is said to have a brother named Kepla, but he is hardly ever seen and it is unclear if he even exists.\"[26]\\nBetween 2009 and 2013, Richards was bookbinding his limited edition versions of each title with runs equaling 50 to 400. These collectible books were typically oversewn by hand with a faux leather hard backing and linen pages inside. In an interview he states:\\n\"Having seen what is being printed by majors these days with poor quality paper, I wanted to provide the reader with a book that carries more value near the same price and that can last for generations. Nothing would be more inspiring to me than to know my books are treasured like an heirloom.\"\\nStylistically, Richards prefers a pencil and ink approach to his illustrations, and his writing often has elements of dark satire. Many of his stories also have a strong environmental message.[27]\\n\\nBetween 2015 and 2018 Richards ran two weekly cartoons on Steamkat, a comic strip site, The Goodbye Family and The Noodle Rut.[28] Richards won the 2016 Official Tasty Nugget award for his illustrated story Sad Lost Doll.[29]  Since 2018, Richards has syndicated his series The Goodbye Family on Tapas as well as through his social media.[30] In 2021, Richards created The Goodbye Family: The Animated Series.[31]\\nSince 2017, Richards has released his comic collections on a nearly quarterly basis, growing his audience, and solely focusing on The Goodbye Family and his Weird West brand. In an interview in 2019, he announced an early 2020 release of his second novel The Goodbye Family and the Great Mountain.\\nRichards has produced and directed several documentaries relating to the American Frontier experience and Welsh American stories. In fiction, Richards created The Goodbye Family: The Animated Series, based on his Weird West characters, which has received such accolades as one of the top ten best animated TV series in 2022 by New York Magazine.[32]\\nA Raven Above Press was founded in 2009 by Richards with a focus on printing his illustrated stories and promoting other authors and illustrators of Celtic and Native American origin. The press also became a catalyst for producing cultural events and art exhibits. Notably, the Los Angeles St. David\\'s Day Festival.[33] On August 1, 2013, Celtic Family Magazine hit the newsstands with a release party in Cardiff, Wales.[11] Richards was the founder and publisher of Celtic Family Magazine from its inception in 2013 to its hiatus in 2017.\\nThe logo for A Raven Above Press displays a raven atop a bending cypress tree. Model Wednesday Mourning appeared in the main ad for A Raven Above Press,[34] as well as Richards daughter Berlin in her traditional Welsh dress.\\nRichards would produce a book for every Welsh event he curated through A Raven Above Press. Outside of including his own illustration, these books often had American and Welsh artists depict the subject matter. Notable artists involved were Jen Delyth, Ruth Jên, Siobhan Owen, Monica Richards, Nichola and Sarah Hope, and Nathan Wyburn to name a few. The following is a list of these books: \\n Richards speaking on the history books he read in grade school: \"Usually the pictures told much more about American history than the text. I remembered seeing at a very early age a glowing photo of Custer and a few pages after (of) an elderly man, who looked like my own grandfather, lying dead in the snow. He was alone, and without care. I later found out his name was Miniconjou chief Spotted Elk (Bigfoot) and he was part of the massacre at Wounded Knee. That photo has always stuck with me. I knew something was not right, and the text which was alongside it was not giving the full story.\"[20]\\nIn 2004, Richards worked at the Southwest Museum of the American Indian while pursuing his B.A. in Cultural Anthropology at California State University, Los Angeles with a focus on Native American studies.[35]\\n Between 2008 and 2012, Richards partnered with Native American and Indigenous groups in Los Angeles to establish Bringing the Circle Together,[36][37] a free monthly film series hosted at the Japanese American National Museum. The series offered a central gathering place to screen documentaries by and about Indigenous people while providing historical narratives with guest speakers, and art and cultural demonstrations. Special guests included Makana, Saginaw Grant, Douglas Miles, Blase Bonpane, among others.\\nThe film series in partnership with AIM Santa Barbara held a community birthday celebration at Nahui Ohlin in Los Angeles for Leonard Peltier on September 12, 2009, with an update on his status and how the public could get involved to petition his release. Richards spoke to a reporter: \"This is all grassroots. Everyone\\'s voice counts. The time is now because Barack Obama, our president, had said it\\'s not the president that actually makes the change, it\\'s going to be our pressure upon the president that will make the change.\"[38] The event was followed in December by a screening of Warrior: The Life of Leonard Peltier with discussion afterward by Ben Carnes, members of AIM Santa Barbara, as well as friends and family.[39]\\nHistory was made at the film series on February 25, 2010, at the screening of Lost Nation: The Ioway when representatives of the Southern Ioway and Northern Ioway tribes gathered with Tongva leaders, making it the first time a meeting took place between Southern California and Midwestern Native American Nations.[40][41]\\nRichards became heavily involved in the Welsh-American community after the closure of the Welsh Presbyterian Church in December 2012.[citation needed] Before this, Richards had helped coordinate an Eisteddfod at Barnsdall Art Park in 2011. Feeling a need to fill the void of losing the church as a cultural center, Richards founded the Los Angeles St. David\\'s Day Festival, an annual event taking place on or around March 1 celebrating Wales. The first festival took place on March 1, 2013. Singer and harpist Siobhan Owen headlined the large-scale event. In conjunction with the festival, Richards began producing Celtic Family Magazine, a nationally distributed print and digital publication on Celtic interests.[42]\\nImperfectualism is an anti-art treatise by Lorin Morgan-Richards, using the pen name Marcil d\\'Hirson Garron, and first published in January 2020.[43] Richards defines Impefectualism as art that cannot be easily replicated by machine. An imperfectualist looks to slow automation through their art.[44] The theme of Imperfectualism is the art of being imperfect. Richards used automatic drawing as a means of producing the work where conscious control is suppressed.[45]\\nIn several interviews, Richards mentioned being influenced by the Dadaists and Surrealists.[46]\\nRichards considers himself a Spiritualist, stating that:\\nAfter a lifetime of witnessing spirit communication and most remarkably of that spirit I have seen firsthand, some in very close proximity, I feel I need to announce my path closely aligns with Spiritualism, or more precisely Spiritism and its view of reincarnation.[47] In relation to his art, Richards states: My imagination helps see the past come to life as if watching a theater production put on by spirits.[48]\\nRichards has created original content and retold classic stories with his illustration for social media.\\nThe following are classic stories illustrated by Richards\\nAlbums released under the name Elder Moon or Lorin Morgan-Richards\\nAlbums released under the name Lorin Morgan-Richards\\nAlbums released with associated acts\\nEPs and Singles released with associated acts\\n',\n",

He created Hopalong Cassidy in 1904 while living in Fryeburg, Maine, and the many short stories and 28 novels were adapted to radio, feature film, television, and comic books, often deviating significantly from the original stories, especially in the character\\'s traits.[1]  While many of his stories depicted Cassidy and other men of the Bar-20 ranch, he also wrote novels (and short stories) of other Westerners, starting with Johnny Nelson in 1920.[2]  He also wrote nonfiction, mostly about the American West, the outdoors, and motoring.[3]\\nMore than just writing a very popular series of Westerns, Mulford recreated an entire detailed and authentic world filled with characters drawn from his extensive library research.[4] His biographer, Francis Nevins, characterized Mulford\\'s writing as \"rooted in Victorian convention.\"[4] Nevins also states that he originated the Western series that has continuous characters, and that, unlike the characters of most later Western series writers, his characters aged.[4]\\nHe died of complications from surgery in Portland, Maine. He set aside much of his money from his books for local charities.\\n',\n",

In 1954, he co-founded The English Westerners\\' Society.[citation needed][2]\\nAt the start of his career, he became first a reader, and later an editor, for Corgi (Bantam) Books in London. Moving to London in the early 1960s made it possible for him to pursue the other consuming interest of his life: American musical theatre. During this time, he also began writing Western fiction as Frederick H. Christian, a pseudonym derived from his own, his wife Heidi\\'s, and his oldest son\\'s first names.[citation needed]\\nOver the next decade, while working in publishing – with Transworld, then Penguin, Collins, and Granada in London, and later with Ballantine and Warner in New York - he produced 14 Westerns as well as a considerable body of journalism.\\nOn 4 July 1973, Nolan quit his job as a highly paid publishing executive and signed a contract to write eight full-length novels in a year. The first of these was The Oshawa Project (published in the U.S. as The Algonquin Project), which MGM later filmed as Brass Target. Since that time Nolan has completed more than 70 books, a similar number of biographical studies, and articles for historical journals.\\nOne of the foremost authorities on the life and times of Billy the Kid,[3] and the history of the American West in general, Nolan appeared frequently in television documentaries dealing with the subject, as well as lecturing to historical societies in the U.K. and U.s., and on cruise ships.\\nHis Westerns include the Angel series of books as well as five additional books in the Sudden series created by Oliver Strange.

       "  'Benjamin Franklin Norris Jr. (March 5, 1870 – October 25, 1902) was an American journalist and novelist during the Progressive Era, whose fiction was predominantly in the naturalist genre.[1][2][3][4][5] His notable works include McTeague: A Story of San Francisco (1899), The Octopus: A Story of California (1901) and The Pit (1903).\\nNorris was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1870.[6] His father, Benjamin, was a self-made Chicago businessman and his mother, Gertrude Glorvina Doggett, had a stage career. In 1884 the family moved to San Francisco where Benjamin went into real estate. In 1887, after the death of his brother and a brief stay in London, young Norris went to Académie Julian in Paris where he studied painting for two years and was exposed to the naturalist novels of Émile Zola.[7][8] Between 1890 and 1894 he attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he became acquainted with the ideas of human evolution of Darwin and Spencer that are reflected in his later writings. His stories appeared in the undergraduate magazine at Berkeley and in the San Francisco Wave.  After his parents\\' divorce he went east and spent a year in the English Department of Harvard University. There he met Lewis E. Gates, who encouraged his writing. He worked as a news correspondent in South Africa (1895–96) for the San Francisco Chronicle, and then as editorial assistant for the San Francisco Wave (1896–97). He worked for McClure\\'s Magazine as a war correspondent in Cuba during the Spanish–American War in 1898. He joined the New York City publishing firm of Doubleday & Page in 1899.\\nDuring his time at the University of California, Berkeley, Norris was a brother in the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta[9][10][11] and was an originator of the Skull & Keys society.[12] Because of his involvement with a prank during the Class Day Exercises in 1893, the annual alumni dinner held by each Phi Gamma Delta chapter still bears his name.[13] In 1900 Frank Norris married Jeannette Black. They had a child in 1902.  \\nNorris died in San Francisco on October 25, 1902, of peritonitis from a ruptured appendix.[14][15] This left The Epic of the Wheat trilogy unfinished.[16] He was 32. He is buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.\\nCharles Gilman Norris, the author\\'s younger brother, became a well regarded novelist and editor. C. G. Norris was also the husband of the prolific novelist Kathleen Norris.  The Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley, houses the archives of all three writers.\\nFrank Norris\\'s work often includes depictions of suffering caused by corrupt and greedy turn-of-the-century corporate monopolies.[17][18] In The Octopus: A California Story, the Pacific and Southwest Railroad is implicated in the suffering and deaths of a number of ranchers in Southern California.  At the end of the novel, after a bloody shootout between farmers and railroad agents at one of the ranches (named Los Muertos), readers are encouraged to take a \"larger view\" that sees that \"through the welter of blood at the irrigating ditch\\xa0... the great harvest of Los Muertos rolled like a flood from the Sierras to the Himalayas to feed thousands of starving scarecrows on the barren plains of India\".  Though free-wheeling market capitalism causes the deaths of many of the characters in the novel, this \"larger view always\\xa0... discovers the Truth that will, in the end, prevail, and all things, surely, inevitably, resistlessly work together for good\".\\nThe novel Vandover and the Brute, written in the 1890s, but not published until after his death, is about three college friends preparing to become successful, and the ruin of one due to a degenerate lifestyle.[19]\\nIn addition to Zola\\'s,[20] Norris\\'s writing has been compared to that of Stephen Crane,[21] Theodore Dreiser, and Edith Wharton.[22]\\nAlthough some of his novels remain highly admired, aspects of Norris\\'s work have not fared well with literary critics in the late 20th and early 21st century. As Donald Pizer writes \"Frank Norris\\'s racism, which included the most vicious anti-Semitic portrayals in any major work of American literature, has long been an embarrassment to admirers of the vigor and intensity of his best fiction and has also contributed to the decline of his reputation during the past several generations.\"[23] Other scholars have confirmed Norris\\'s antisemitism.[24][25] Norris\\'s work is often seen as strongly influenced by the scientific racism of the late 19th century, such as that espoused by his professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Joseph LeConte.[26] Along with his contemporary Jack London, Norris is seen as \"reconstructing American identity as a biological category of Anglo-Saxon masculinity.\"[27] In Norris\\'s work, critics have seen evidence of racism, antisemitism, and contempt for immigrants and the working poor, all of whom are seen as the losers in a Social-Darwinist struggle for existence.[28]\\nFiction\\nShort Stories\\nNon-fiction\\nSelected articles\\nTranslations\\nCollected works\\n',\n",

She wrote primarily under the pen name Andre Norton, but also under Andrew North and Allen Weston. She was the first woman to be Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy,[2] to be SFWA Grand Master,[3] and to be inducted by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame.[4][5][6]\\nAlice Mary Norton was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1912.[7]  Her parents were Adalbert Freely Norton, who owned a rug company, and Bertha Stemm Norton. Alice began writing at Collinwood High School in Cleveland, under the tutelage of Sylvia Cochrane. She was the editor of a literary page in the school\\'s paper, The Collinwood Spotlight, for which she wrote short stories. During this time, she wrote her first book, Ralestone Luck, which was eventually published as her second novel in 1938.[8]\\nAfter graduating from high school in 1930, Norton planned to become a teacher, and began studying at Flora Stone Mather College of Western Reserve University. However, in 1932 she had to leave because of the Depression and began working for the Cleveland Library System,[8] where she remained for 18 years, latterly in the children\\'s section of the Nottingham Branch Library in Cleveland. In a 1996 interview she recalled defending acquisition of The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien for the library.[9] In 1934, she legally changed her name to Andre Alice Norton, a pen name she had adopted for her first book, published later that year, to increase her marketability, since boys were the main audience for fantasy.[8]\\nDuring 1940–1941, she worked as a special librarian in the cataloging department of the Library of Congress.[10] She was involved in a project related to alien citizenship which was abruptly terminated upon the American entry into World War\\xa0II. In 1941 she bought a bookstore called Mystery House in Mount Rainier, Maryland, the eastern neighbor of Washington, D.C. The business failed, and she returned to the Cleveland Public Library until 1950, when she retired due to ill health.[11] She then began working as a reader for publisher-editor Martin Greenberg[a] at Gnome Press, a small press in New York City that focused on science fiction. She remained until 1958, when, with 21 novels published,[12][13] she became a full-time professional writer.\\nAs Norton\\'s health became uncertain, she moved to Winter Park, Florida in November 1966, where she remained until 1997.[14]  She moved to Murfreesboro, Tennessee in 1997 and was under hospice care from February 21, 2005. She died at home on March 17, 2005, of congestive heart failure.\\nIn 1934, her first book, The Prince Commands, being sundry adventures of Michael Karl, sometime crown prince & pretender to the throne of Morvania, with illustrations by Kate Seredy,  was published by D.\\xa0Appleton–Century Company (cataloged by the U.S. Library of Congress as by \"André Norton\").[15][16] She went on to write several historical novels for the juvenile (now called \"young adult\") market.\\nNorton\\'s first published science fiction was a short story, \"The People of the Crater\", which appeared under the name \"Andrew North\" as pages 4–18 of the inaugural 1947 number of Fantasy Book, a magazine from Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc.[17] Her first fantasy novel, Huon of the Horn, published by Harcourt Brace under her own name in 1951, adapted the 13th-century story of Huon, Duke of Bordeaux.[18] Her first science fiction novel, Star Man\\'s Son, 2250 A.D., appeared from Harcourt in 1952.[19] She became a prolific novelist in the 1950s, with many of her books published for the juvenile market, at least in their original hardcover editions.\\nAs of 1958, when she became a full-time professional writer, Kirkus had reviewed 16 of her novels,[b] and awarded four of them starred reviews.[13]  Her four starred reviews to 1957 had been awarded for three historical adventure novels—Follow the Drum (1942), Scarface (1948), Yankee Privateer (1955)—and one cold war adventure, At Swords\\' Points (1954). She received four starred reviews subsequently, latest in 1966, including three for science fiction.[13]\\nNorton was twice nominated for the Hugo Award, in 1964 for the novel Witch World and in 1967 for the novelette \"Wizard\\'s World\". She was nominated three times for the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement, winning the award in 1998. Norton won a number of other genre awards and regularly had works appear in the Locus annual \"best of year\" polls.[4]\\nShe was a founding member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers\\' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s, led by Lin Carter, with entry by fantasy credentials alone. Norton was the only woman among the original eight members. Some works by SAGA members were published in Lin Carter\\'s Flashing Swords! anthologies.\\nIn 1976, Gary Gygax invited Norton to play Dungeons & Dragons in his Greyhawk world. Norton subsequently wrote Quag Keep, which involved a group of characters who travel from the real world to Greyhawk. It was the first novel to be set, at least partially, in the Greyhawk setting and, according to Alternative Worlds, the first to be based on D&D.[20] Quag Keep was excerpted in Issue 12 of The Dragon (February 1978) just prior to the book\\'s release.[21] She and Jean Rabe were collaborating on the sequel to Quag Keep when Norton died. Return to Quag Keep was completed by Rabe and published by Tor Books in January 2006.[17]\\nHer final complete novel, Three Hands for Scorpio, was published on April 1, 2005. Besides Return to Quag Keep, Tor has published two more novels with Norton and Rabe credited as co-authors, Dragon Mage (November 2006) and Taste of Magic (January 2008).[17]\\nNorton wrote more than a dozen speculative fiction series, but her longest, and longest-running project was \"Witch World\", which began with the novel Witch World in 1963. The first six novels were Ace Books paperback originals published from 1963 to 1968.[17] From the 1970s most of the books in the series were first published in hardcover editions.[17] From the 1980s some were written by Norton and a co-author, and others were anthologies of short fiction for which she was editor. (Witch World became a shared universe.)[c] There were dozens of books in all.[19]\\nThe five novels of The Cycle of Oak, Yew, Ash, and Rowan, To the King a Daughter,  Knight or Knave, A Crown Disowned,  Dragon Blade, and The Knight of the Red Beard, were written with Sasha Miller.[22]  The fifth and last novel was dedicated \"To my late collaborator, Andre Norton, whose vision inspired the NordornLand cycle.\"[23]  (\"NordornLand cycle\" is another name for this cycle.)\\nOften called the Grande Dame of Science Fiction and Fantasy by biographers such as J. M. Cornwell,[24] and organizations such as Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America,[25] Publishers Weekly,[26] and Time, Andre Norton wrote novels for more than 70 years. She had a profound influence on the entire genre, having more than 300 published titles read by at least four generations of science fiction and fantasy readers and writers. Notable authors who cite her influence include Greg Bear, Lois McMaster Bujold, C. J. Cherryh, Cecilia Dart-Thornton,[27] Tanya Huff,[28] Mercedes Lackey, Charles de Lint, Joan D. Vinge, David Weber, K. D. Wentworth, and Catherine Asaro.\\nOn February 20, 2005, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, which had honored Norton with its Grand Master Award in 1984, announced the creation of the Andre Norton Award, to be given each year for an outstanding work of fantasy or science fiction for the young adult literature market, beginning with 2005 publications. While the Norton Award is not a Nebula Award, it is voted on by SFWA members on the Nebula ballot and shares some procedures with the Nebula Awards.[29][30][31] Nominally for a young adult book, actually the eligible class is middle grade and young adult novels. This added a category for genre fiction to be recognized and supported for young readers.[32] Unlike Nebulas, there is a jury whose function is to expand the ballot beyond the six books with most nominations by members.\\nNorton received the Inkpot Award in 1989.[33]\\nThe High Hallack Library was a facility that Norton was instrumental in organizing and opening. Designed as a research facility for genre writers, and scholars of \"popular\" literature (the genres of science fiction, fantasy, mystery, western, romance, gothic, and horror), it was located near Norton\\'s home in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.[34]\\nThe facility, named after one of the continents in Norton\\'s Witch World series, was home to more than 10,000 texts, videos, and various other media. Attached to the facility were three guest rooms, allowing authors and scholars the chance to stay on-site to facilitate their research goals.[34]\\nThe facility was opened on February 28, 1999, and operated until March 2004. Most of the collection was sold during the closing days of the facility. The declining health of Andre Norton was one of the leading causes of its closing.[34]\\nDigital collections\\nInstitutional collections\\nOther information\\n',\n",

His science fiction is generally classified as anthropological science fiction because he often used insights from his professional work to inform his fictional writing.[1]\\nAn avid fly fisherman, Professor Oliver supported the Guadalupe River Chapter of Trout Unlimited and the cold water fishery downstream from Canyon Dam.  Numerous scenes in his writings made reference to actions and experiences related to fishing in moving water (e.g. wading a river in \"Shores of Another Sea\").\\n',\n",

Paine's sister Nancy died in a car accident in 1930. In the 1930s, he worked as a cowboy, competed in rodeos, and was a movie stuntman in several Johnny Mack Brown westerns and 1936's The Charge of the Light Brigade.

       "  'Robert Brown Parker (September 17, 1932 – January 18, 2010) was an American writer, primarily of fiction within the mystery/detective genre. His most famous works were the 40 novels written about the fictional private detective Spenser. ABC television network developed the television series Spenser: For Hire based on the character in the mid-1980s; a series of TV movies was also produced based on the character. His works incorporate encyclopedic knowledge of the Boston metropolitan area.[2] The Spenser novels have been cited as reviving and changing the detective genre by critics and bestselling authors[3] including Robert Crais, Harlan Coben, and Dennis Lehane.[4]\\nParker also wrote nine novels featuring the fictional character Jesse Stone, a Los Angeles police officer who moves to a small New England town; six novels with the fictional character Sunny Randall, a female private investigator; and four Westerns starring the duo Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch. The first was Appaloosa, made into a film starring Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen.\\nParker was born in Springfield, Massachusetts.[5] In 1956, Parker married Joan H. Parker, whom he claimed to have met as a toddler at a birthday party.[6] They spent their childhoods in the same neighborhood.[7]\\nAfter earning a BA degree from Colby College in Waterville, Maine, Parker served as a soldier in the US Army Infantry in Korea. In 1957, he earned his master\\'s degree in English literature from Boston University and then worked in advertising and technical writing until 1962.[5] Parker received a PhD in English literature from Boston University in 1971.[8] His dissertation, titled \"The Violent Hero, Wilderness Heritage, and Urban Reality,\" discussed the exploits of fictional private-eye heroes created by Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Ross Macdonald.[5]\\nParker wrote his first novel[8] in 1971 while teaching at Northeastern University. He became a full professor in 1976, and turned to full-time writing in 1979, with five Spenser novels to his credit.[5]\\nParker\\'s popular Spenser novels are known for his characters of varied races and religions. According to critic Christina Nunez, Parker\\'s \"inclusion of [characters of] other races and sexual persuasions\" lends his writings a \"more modern feel\".[9]  For example, the Spenser series characters include Hawk and Chollo, African-American and Mexican-American, respectively, as well as Spenser\\'s Jewish girlfriend, Susan, various Russians, Ukrainians, Chinese, a gay cop, Lee Farrell, and even a gay mob boss, Gino Fish.[10] The homosexuality of both his sons gave his writing \"[a] sensibility,\" Ms. Nunez feels, \"[which] strengthens Parker\\'s sensibility [toward gays].\" In 1985, Spenser was made into a successful television series, Spenser for Hire which starred Robert Urich, Avery Brooks and Barbara Stock.\\nIn 1994, Parker collaborated with Japanese photographer Kasho Kumagai on a coffee table book called Spenser\\'s Boston, exploring the city through Spenser\\'s \"eyes\" via high quality, 4-color photos. In addition to Parker\\'s introduction, excerpts from several of the Spenser novels were included.[11]\\nParker created female detective Sunny Randall at the request of actress Helen Hunt, who wanted him to write a part for her to play. He wrote the first book, and the film version was planned for 2000[5] but never materialized.[8]  However, his publisher liked the character and asked him to continue with the series.[8]\\nAnother figure created by Parker was Jesse Stone, a troubled former LAPD detective, who starts a new career as a police chief in a small New England town. Between 1997 and 2010, he wrote nine novels featuring Jesse Stone, all of which have been adapted as a series of TV movies by CBS starring Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone.\\nAside from crime writing, Parker also produced several Western novels, including Appaloosa,[12] and children\\'s books. Like Parker\\'s Spenser series, his Westerns have received critical attention. Chris Dacus, who has written on other authors like Cormac McCarthy, has written of the intellectual depth and importance of Parker\\'s Westerns in The Stoic Western Hero: Robert B. Parker\\'s Westerns.[13]\\nParker and his wife created an independent film company called Pearl Productions, based in Boston. It was named after their German short-haired pointer, Pearl.[8]\\nParker and his wife, Joan, had two sons, David and Daniel.  Originally, the character of Spenser was to have been called \"David,\" but Parker didn\\'t want to appear to favor one of his sons over the other.  Parker therefore omitted Spenser\\'s first name entirely, and it was never revealed.\\nParker and his wife separated at one point but then came to an unusual arrangement. They lived in a three-story Victorian house just outside of Harvard Square; she lived on one floor and he on another, and they shared the middle floor. This living arrangement is mirrored in Spenser\\'s private life: his girlfriend, Susan, had an aversion to marriage and living together full-time. Living separately suited them both, although they were fully committed to each other. Explaining the arrangement in an interview on CBS Sunday Morning, Parker said, \"I want to make love to my wife for the rest of my life, but I never want to sleep with her again.\"\\nHe had a great fondness for dogs, including German Shorthair Pointers. Dogs were included in his Spenser stories, aging along with the character and appearing in the ongoing series of novels. The dogs were always named Pearl.[14]\\nParker\\'s favorite books were The Bear, The Great Gatsby, Hamlet, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Maltese Falcon, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Dubliners, The Big Sleep, U.S.A. trilogy, and The Ambassadors.[15]\\nParker received three nominations and two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America.  He received the first award, the \"Best Novel Award\" in 1977, for the fourth novel in the Spenser series, Promised Land.[16]  In 1983, he received the Maltese Falcon Award, Japan, for Early Autumn.  In 1990 he shared, with wife Joan, a nomination for \"Best Television Episode\" for the TV series B.L. Stryker; however, the award went to David J. Burke and Alfonse Ruggiero Jr. for Wiseguy.\\nIn 2002, he received the Grand Master Award Edgar for his collective oeuvre.[17]\\nParker received the 2002 Joseph E. Connor Memorial Award from the Phi Alpha Tau Fraternity at Emerson College. He was inducted into the fraternity as an honorary brother in Spring 2003.[18]\\nIn 2008, he was awarded the Gumshoe Lifetime Achievement Award.\\nParker was 77 when he died suddenly of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 18, 2010; discovered at his desk by his wife Joan, he had been working on a novel.[1][19][20]\\nJoan Parker, the inspiration for the Susan Silverman character in the Spenser series, died June 12, 2013. \\nLater written by Ace Atkins, the Spenser series continued following Parker\\'s death. The Boston Globe wrote that while some people might have \"viewed the move as unseemly, those people didn\\'t know Robert B. Parker, a man who, when asked how his books would be viewed in 50 years, replied: \\'Don\\'t know, don\\'t care.\\' He was proud of his work, but he mainly saw writing as a means of providing a comfortable life for his family.\"[14]\\nAfter Parker died, his family, together with Parker\\'s publishers, chose to continue the Jesse Stone, Spenser and Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch series.[21]\\nAce Atkins was selected to continue the Spenser novels.  The book Parker was working on at the time of his death was completed by his literary agent Helen Bran.[22]\\nEleven Jesse Stone novels  have been published since Parker\\'s death.  The first three were by Parker\\'s longtime friend and collaborator, Michael Brandman, and the next six by Reed Farrel Coleman.[23][24] Mike Lupica wrote the 10th in 2020 and eleventh in 2021.\\nParker\\'s Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch was continued by actor and screenwriter Robert Knott.[25]\\nThe Sunny Randall series continued with Blood Feud (November 27, 2018) and Grudge Match (May 4, 2020).

He used the last two names when writing in collaboration with Wayne D. Overholser.\\nAs can be seen below, between 1952 and 2003, for some 51 years (included are 2 extra years in 2002-2003 after his death to follow through with unfinished publications), Patten was indeed quite prolific. During that time, he penned at least 110 novels and a further 3 collections of short stories all mostly in the 'Western' genre of writing. \\nThat he is not better known as a writer is likely due to the fact that Hollywood movie makers were not exactly beating down his door to turn his many writings into Hollywood movies. Indeed only 2 Hollywood movies credit Patten as a source for their movie, the 1956 Movie Red Sundown, and the 1969 Movie Death of a Gunfighter. The later 1971 Movie Long Live Your Death, which featured the noted actors Eli Wallach and Lynn Redgrave, cheated this unofficial Hollywood boycott of Patten by actually being a non-Hollywood so-called Spaghetti Western. The tragedy of Hollywood movie makers just thumbing their noses at Patten continued with the 1969 Movie The Undefeated starring the then famed actors John Wayne and Rock Hudson, a movie which even failed to credit Patten as an inspiration for this particular major movie - see below under 'Films'.\\n\",\n",
       "  'Charles McColl Portis (December 28, 1933 – February 17, 2020) was an American author best known for his novels Norwood (1966) and the classic Western True Grit (1968). Both Norwood and True Grit were adapted as films, released in 1970 and 1969, respectively. True Grit also inspired a film sequel and a made-for-TV movie sequel. The second film adaptation of True Grit was released in 2010.[1]\\nIn 2023 The Library of America published his Collected Works.[2] In the introduction editor Jay Jennings observes,\"Charles Portis is now recognized as a singular American genius, a writer whose deadpan style, picaresque plots, and unforgettable characters have drawn a passionate following among readers and writers.\"[3]\\nPortis has been described as \"one of the most inventively comic writers of western fiction\".[4]\\nCharles Portis was born in 1933 in El Dorado, Arkansas, the son of Alice (Waddell) and Samuel Palmer Portis. He was raised and educated in various towns in southern Arkansas, including Hamburg and Mount Holly.[1]\\nDuring the Korean War, Portis enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and reached the rank of sergeant.[5]  After receiving his discharge in 1955, he enrolled in the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.  He graduated with a degree in journalism in 1958.[6]\\nPortis began writing in college, for both the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville student newspaper, Arkansas Traveler, and the Northwest Arkansas Times.  One of his tasks was to redact the colorful reporting of \"lady stringers\" in the Ozarks, a task credited as a source for the vivid voice that he created years later for his character Mattie Ross in True Grit.[7]  After Portis graduated, he worked for various newspapers as a reporter, including the Memphis Commercial Appeal and almost two years at the Arkansas Gazette, for which he wrote the \"Our Town\" column.[1]\\nHe then moved to New York City, where he worked for four years at the New York Herald Tribune. Here he briefly dated Nora Ephron.  His work led him to return to the South frequently to cover civil rights stories during the early 1960s.  After serving as the London bureau chief of the New York Herald Tribune, he left journalism in 1964.[1]\\nPortis next returned to Arkansas and began writing fiction full-time.  In his first novel, Norwood (1966), he showed his preference for travel narratives with deadpan dialogue, combined with amusing observations on American culture.  Set sometime from 1959 through 1961, the novel revolves around Norwood Pratt, a young, naïve ex-Marine living in Ralph, Texas.  He is  persuaded by con man Grady Fring (the first of several such characters created by Portis) to transport two automobiles to New York City.  Norwood encounters a variety of people on the way to New York and back, including ex-circus midget Edmund Ratner (\"the world’s smallest perfect fat man\"), Joann (\"the college-educated chicken\"), and Rita Lee, a girl Norwood woos and wins on the bus ride back to the South.[1]\\nLike Norwood, his novel True Grit (1968) was first serialized in condensed form in The Saturday Evening Post. The story is told in first person from the perspective of Yell County native Mattie Ross. At the time of the novel\\'s events, she is a prim, shrewd, strong-willed, Bible-quoting 14-year-old girl. When her father is murdered in Fort Smith, Arkansas, by Tom Chaney, a hired hand, she sets out to bring the killer to justice. She recruits Deputy Marshal Rooster Cogburn\\xa0— in whom Mattie sees one possessed of \"grit\"\\xa0— to help her hunt down Chaney (who has joined an  outlaw band) to \"avenge her father’s blood\".[8]\\nBoth Norwood and True Grit were adapted as movies, with fellow Arkansan Glen Campbell and Kim Darby in leading roles in the two films.  Both pictures were commercially successful.  John Wayne won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Actor for his performance as Rooster Cogburn in True Grit, one of the top box-office hits of 1969.  True Grit was released on June 11, 1969, earning US$14.25 million at the box office.  A second film version, written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen and starring Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld debuted in December 2010.[9]\\nPortis published several short pieces in The Atlantic Monthly, including the memoir \"Combinations of Jacksons\"[10] and the story \"I Don\\'t Talk Service No More\".[11]\\nHis final published work was the collection Escape Velocity: A Charles Portis Miscellany, including journalism and other non-fiction, short stories, and a single play, Delray\\'s New Moon.  Subjects include the civil rights movement, a road trip in Baja, and Elvis Presley\\'s visit to his aging mother. Some of the works originally appeared in such publications such as the New York Herald Tribune and Saturday Evening Post.[12] New York Times book reviewer Carlo Rotella said, \"You can enjoy Escape Velocity as a stand-alone collection, but a Portis miscellany will always be read too as a key to the experiences and craft lessons that shaped the novels.\"[13]\\nWriting of Portis, Aaron Gilbreath has observed that his literary obscurity might, like him, remain forever hidden, because\\n\"he won\\'t surface long enough to let reporters ask him about it.\"[14]\\nIt has been suggested that Portis\\'s novels \"were a little too humorous and a little too \\'regional\\' to attract the kind of attention that leads to National Book Awards and excerpts in textbook anthologies. Too many \\'pale cranks,\\' bushwhackers, and \\'jackleg preachers.\\'\"[15]\\nHowever, in 2023 the Library of America published his Collected Works.[3]\\nPortis lived in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he died of Alzheimer\\'s disease on February 17, 2020, at the age of 86.[16][1]\\nNovels\\nNonfiction\\nShort fiction, articles, etc.\\n',\n",

Her short story \"Brokeback Mountain\" was adapted as an Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe Award-winning motion picture released in 2005.\\nProulx was born Edna Ann Proulx in Norwich, Connecticut, to Lois Nellie (née Gill) and Georges-Napoléon Proulx.[5] Her first name honored one of her mother\\'s aunts. She is of English and French-Canadian ancestry.[6][7] Her maternal forebears came to America in 1635, 15 years after the Mayflower arrived.[8]\\nProulx lived in multiple states along the East Coast during her childhood as her father worked his way up through the textile industry.[9][10][11] She wrote her first story at the age of 10, while sick with chicken pox.[9] She graduated from Deering High School in Portland, Maine.[12] She briefly attended Colby College, where she met her first husband, H. Ridgely Bullock, Jr., and dropped out to marry him in 1955.[10] She later returned to college, studying at the University of Vermont from 1966 to 1969, and graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in History in 1969. She earned her M.A. in history from Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in Montreal, Quebec in 1973.[13] Proulx pursued a PhD at Concordia and passed her oral examinations in 1975, but abandoned her dissertation before completing the degree. In 1999, Concordia awarded her an honorary doctorate.[14]\\nProulx lived for more than 30 years in Vermont, has married and divorced three times, and has three sons and a daughter (Jonathan, Gillis, Morgan, and Sylvia). In 1994, she moved to Bird Cloud, a ranch in Saratoga, Wyoming, spending part of the year in northern Newfoundland on a small cove adjacent to L\\'Anse aux Meadows. As of 2019, Proulx lived in Port Townsend, Washington.[15]\\nStarting as a journalist, her first published work of fiction was \"The Customs Lounge\", a science fiction story published in the September 1963 issue of If, under the byline \"E.A. Proulx\".[16]\\nA year later, her science fiction story \"All the Pretty Little Horses\" appeared in the teen magazine Seventeen in June 1964. She subsequently published stories in Esquire magazine and Gray\\'s Sporting Journal in the late 1970s, as well as how-to manuals for cooking and gardening.[17][18] Proulx published her first short-story collection, Heart Songs, in 1988 and her first novel, Postcards, in 1992.[11] She was the first woman to receive the PEN/Faulkner Award, which was awarded to Postcards.[19] She was awarded a NEA fellowship and a Guggenheim fellowship in 1992.[20][2] Her 1993 novel The Shipping News was adapted for a 2001 film. Set in Newfoundland yet written by someone \"from away\"[21] (not from Newfoundland), the novel stresses the vicarious quality of Proulx\\' writing.\\n\\nShe had the following comment on her celebrity status: It\\'s not good for one\\'s view of human nature, that\\'s for sure. You begin to see, when invitations are coming from festivals and colleges to come read (for an hour for a hefty sum of money), that the institutions are head-hunting for trophy writers. Most don\\'t particularly care about your writing or what you\\'re trying to say. You\\'re there as a human object, one that has won a prize. It gives you a very odd, meat-rack kind of sensation.[22]In 1997, Proulx was awarded the Dos Passos Prize, a mid-career award for American writers.[23] Proulx has twice won the O. Henry Prize for the year\\'s best short story. In 1998, she won for \"Brokeback Mountain\", which had appeared in The New Yorker on October 13, 1997. Proulx won again the following year for \"The Mud Below\", which appeared in The New Yorker June 22 and 29, 1999. Both appear in her 1999 collection of short stories, Close Range: Wyoming Stories. The lead story in this collection, entitled \"The Half-Skinned Steer\", was selected by author Garrison Keillor for inclusion in The Best American Short Stories 1998, (Proulx herself edited the 1997 edition of this series) and later by novelist John Updike for inclusion in The Best American Short Stories of the Century (1999).[19]\\nIn 2007, the composer Charles Wuorinen approached Proulx with the idea of turning her short story \"Brokeback Mountain\" into an opera. The opera of the same name with a libretto by Proulx herself premiered January 28, 2014, at the Teatro Real in Madrid. It was praised as an often brilliant adaptation that clearly conveyed the text of the libretto with music that is rich in imagination and variety.[24][25][26][27][28] Proulx published her first non-fiction book, Bird Cloud: A Memoir, largely based on her former Wyoming ranch of the same name.[18][29] In 2017, she received the Fitzgerald Award for that year for Achievement in American Literature.[30]\\n',\n",

After his mother died, his family migrated from England to Arkansas when Raine was ten years old, eventually settling on a cattle ranch near the Texas-Arkansas border. In 1894, after graduating from Oberlin College, Raine left Arkansas and headed for the western U.S. He became the principal of a school in Seattle while contributing columns to a local newspaper. Later he moved to Denver, where he worked as a reporter and editorial writer for local periodicals, including the Republican, the Post, and the Rocky Mountain News.\\nAt this time he began to publish short stories, eventually becoming a full-time free-lance fiction writer, and finally finding his literary home in the novel. His earliest novels were romantic histories taking place in the English countryside. However, after spending some time with the Arizona Rangers, Raine shifted his literary focus and began to utilize the American West as a setting. The publication of Wyoming in 1908 marks the beginning of his prolific career, during which time he averaged nearly two western novels a year until his death in 1954. In 1920 he was awarded an M.L. degree from the University of Colorado, where he had established that school's first journalism course.\\nDuring the First World War 500,000 copies of one of his books were sent to British soldiers in the trenches. Twenty of his novels have been filmed. Though he was prolific, he was a slow, careful, conscientious worker, intent on accurate detail, and considered himself a craftsman rather than an artist.\\nIn 1905 Raine married Jennie P. Langley, who died in 1922. In 1924 he married Florence A. Hollingsworth; they had a daughter. Though he traveled a good deal, Denver was considered his home.\\nIn 1928, he ghost wrote with Billy Breakenridge, the book Helldorado: Bringing Law to the Mesquite. Breakenridge had been a deputy sheriff under Johnny Behan in Tombstone, Arizona Territory during the period of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Breakenridge had pressed Wyatt for details about his time in Tombstone to add to the book. It was published the year before Wyatt died.[2] and it depicted Wyatt as a thief, pimp, crooked gambler, and murderer.[3] The book stated that the Earps and Doc Holliday aggressively mistreated the guiltless cowboys until they were forced into a fatal confrontation.[4] His description of the 1881 O.K. Corral gun fight stated that the Clanton and McLaury brothers were merely cowboys who had been unarmed and surrendered but the Earp brothers had shot them in cold blood.[3] Wyatt and Josie protested that the book's contents was biased and more fiction than fact. Earp complained about the book until his death in January, 1929, and his wife continued in the same vein afterward.[4]:\\u200a36\\u200a\\nRaine died on July 25, 1954, and is buried at Fairmount Cemetery in Denver.

He attended school in Nebraska and Kansas.  \"I was the eldest of six children of a very poor couple. My father was a horse breaker and former cavalryman; my mother was the daughter of a frontier blacksmith and woodworker. I may be the last professional writer who talked to those survivors of the 1880s and 1890s and who grew up in the same environment. It was a specialized education for one job alone, the one I have.\"[4] He married Margaret Smith in 1938, was divorced, and married Norma Spivack in 1962.  Altogether he had seven children, one of whom was adopted.  In addition to writing, John H. Reese worked for the U.S. Department of Internal Revenue and as a reporter for the Los Angeles Examiner in California and as a free-lance reporter for newspapers in Mexico. His first Western novel was Signal Guns At Sunup using the pseudonym John Jo Carpenter.

       "  'Conrad Michael Richter (October 13, 1890 – October 30, 1968) was an American novelist whose lyrical work is concerned largely with life on the American frontier in various periods. His novel The Town (1950), the last story of his trilogy The Awakening Land about the Ohio frontier, won the 1951 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.[1] His novel The Waters of Kronos won the 1961 National Book Award for Fiction.[2] Two collections of short stories were published posthumously during the 20th century, and several of his novels have been reissued during the 21st century by academic presses.\\nConrad Michael Richter was born in 1890 in Tremont, Pennsylvania, near Pottsville, to John Absalom Richter, a Lutheran minister, and Charlotte Esther (née Henry) Richter. Coming from a long line of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestors,[3] his grandfather, uncle and great-uncle were also Lutheran ministers, and descended from German colonial immigrants. As a child, Richter lived with his family in several small central Pennsylvania mining towns, where he encountered descendants of pioneers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who shared family stories. These inspired him later to write historical fiction set in changing American frontiers. Attending local public schools, Richter finished his formal education when he graduated high school at age fifteen.[4]\\nAt the age of 19, Richter started working as an editor of a local weekly newspaper, the Patton, Pennsylvania Courier. In 1911 Richter relocated to Cleveland, Ohio, and worked as the private secretary to a wealthy manufacturing family. Richter married Harvena Maria Achenbach in 1915. They had their only child, Harvena Richter, in 1917. Richter worked subsequently for a small publishing company, initiated a juvenile magazine, and started writing short stories. During the 1930s, he also performed two brief stints as a screenwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Hollywood, California.[5]\\nRichter continued writing and trying to sell short stories.[4] In 1913, a young Conrad Richter sent manuscripts to literary editor Frederic Taber Cooper. Responding to Richter’s letter, Cooper writes that he does not give “gratuitous opinions on manuscripts, either to friends or strangers ... I suspect that your main difficulty is that, in straining after originality, you fail to make your stories ring true. Try to be simpler.”[6] His short story \"Brothers of No Kin,\" published in Forum magazine in 1914,[4] was included in the \"Roll of Honor for 1914\" of American stories by Edward J. O\\'Brien, editor of the Best Short Stories of 1915.[7] O\\'Brien wrote in his \"Introduction\" that Richter\\'s story was the best of all those published in 1914; the editor was explicitly concerned with the development of an \"American literature\" and considered Richter as integral to this.[7] This short story was re-issued as the title story of a posthumous collection published in 1973.\\nIn 1928 Richter relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for the sake of his wife\\'s health.[5] During this period, he also collected much material from which he created short stories about the Southwest frontier days. By 1933, Richter and his wife had returned to live in his hometown of Pine Grove, Pennsylvania. They subsequently alternated between Pine Grove, Albuquerque, and Florida.[8]\\nDuring the early 1930s, Richter had numerous stories published in pulp magazines such as Triple-X, Short Stories, Complete Stories, Ghost Stories, and Blue Book.[9][10] His Early Americana and Other Stories (1936) was considered his first successful book.[8]\\nHe persisted with his work, gradually writing and publishing full-length novels. Richter set his novels in different periods of American history on its changing frontier. He may be best known for The Sea of Grass (1936), set in late nineteenth-century New Mexico, and featuring conflict between ranchers and farmers. It was later adapted as a movie of the same name, directed by Elia Kazan and featuring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, released in 1947.\\nRichter\\'s novel The Light in the Forest (1953), set in late eighteenth-century Pennsylvania and Ohio, featured challenges faced by a young white man who had become an assimilated Lenape Amerindian after being taken captive as a child. After the boy was returned as a youth to white culture, he was considered suspicious. This novel also became very popular and had a second life as a movie, released in 1958. Richter returned to the topic of the white child raised in an alien culture in his later novel A Country of Strangers (1966). As noted by Ernest Cady in his review in the Columbus Dispatch, both books were written from the point of view of Indians. He wrote of Richter,\\nHe simply tells how he thinks things were for both Indians and whites, in a hard time of violence and danger and change on a raw frontier. And does it so convincingly that the reader senses that this indeed, is how it must have been.[4]During this period, Richter also published the novels of his trilogy The Awakening Land, about the Ohio frontier: The Trees (1940), The Fields (1946), and The Town (1950). In 1947 he won the Ohioana Book Award for The Fields.[4] The Town was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1951.[1] In a review of the last novel, Louis Bromfield, also an Ohio writer and winner of the Pulitzer Prize, wrote of the trilogy:\\nthe three books are not only concerned with Sayward and her family but the growth and the astonishingly rapid development of a whole area which has played a key role in the nation\\'s history… Mr. Richter has reproduced the quality and the speech of these people so well that a thousand years from now, one may read his books and know exactly what these people were like and what it was like to have lived in an era when within three or four generations a frontier wilderness turned into one of the great industrial areas of the earth…. \\'The Town\\' stands on its own as an entity and may be read on its own as a full, rich and comprehensive novel based upon the lives of ordinary people, brave and ever heroic in their own small way...[4]\\nThe trilogy was first published in one volume in 1966 by Alfred A. Knopf. It was adapted as a TV miniseries of the same name in 1978, in which several plot changes were made as a result of the changing social culture of the time, especially concerning race and sexuality. \\nRichter\\'s short story, \"Doctor Hanray\\'s Second Chance\", first published in the magazine The Saturday Evening Post in 1950 (June 10),[11] has a theme of reconciling with the past. Richter returned to this theme in his 1960 autobiographical novel, The Waters of Kronos (Chronos). (Chronos was the ancient Greek personification of Time.) This novel won the U.S. National Book Award in 1961.[2]\\nThe short story \"Doctor Hanray\" was republished in the anthology, The Saturday Evening Post Fantasy Stories (1951) and in several later speculative fiction anthologies published by the Post and others.[11] The Internet Speculative Fiction Database catalogs five of Richter\\'s stories, including a very early one, \"The Head of His House\", from a 1917 anthology, The Grim Thirteen (Dodd, Mead).[11]\\nAfter Richter\\'s death, two short story collections were published posthumously. Additionally, several of his novels have been reissued by academic presses. When The Waters of Kronos was reissued in paperback format in 2003, one reviewer wrote,\\nTo celebrate the reappearance of such a worthy novel may be an expression of regional patriotism, but it should also be an opportunity to think about our own small towns, our own haunted memories, and our own quest for the meaning of the past.The Sea of Grass, The Trees and Tacey Cromwell were published as Armed Services Editions during WWII.\\nRichter received national and regional literary awards, and several honorary doctorates.\\n',\n",

       "  'Jack Warner Schaefer (November 19, 1907 – 24 January 1991)[1] was an American writer known for his Westerns.  His best-known works are the 1949 novel Shane, considered the greatest western novel by the Western Writers of America,[2] and the 1964 children\\'s book Stubby Pringle\\'s Christmas.\\nJack Warren Schaefer was born in Cleveland, Ohio to Carl and Minnie Schaefer. Carl was a German American attorney. Both his parents were avid readers, and his father was good friends with poet/author Carl Sandburg. Schaefer read voraciously as a child; early favorites were Edgar Rice Burroughs and Alexandre Dumas, before moving onto Charles Dickens and Zane Grey, among others. He was to describe himself as a “literary nut.”[3]\\nIn 1929 Schaefer graduated from Oberlin College with a major in English.[4] From 1929 to 1930 he attended graduate school at Columbia University, but left without completing his Master of Arts degree when the faculty there denied him permission to prepare a master\\'s thesis on the development of motion pictures.[5] Schaefer\\'s education included multiple courses on Greek and Roman mythology, which is thought to have served him well in creating the archetypal heroes that populated his Westerns.[6]\\nFollowing his departure from Columbia University, Schaefer went to work for the United Press. In his long career as a journalist, he worked as a reporter for the United Press news agency, as editorial page editor for The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, Va., and The Baltimore Sun, and as editor of The New Haven Journal-Courier.[7]\\nIn his career as a journalist, Schaefer wrote innumerable news stories, feature articles, and opinion columns and thousands of book/film/play reviews and editorials.[8]\\nIn the 1930s Schaefer worked as the education director of the Connecticut State Reformatory, and following his stint at the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot (1944 to 1948), he worked in advertising and was a freelance writer before devoting himself to fiction.[9]\\nAs a child Schaefer was an avid reader of Zane Grey and was fascinated with the old west. He later studied American history which formed the basis of many of his westerns.[10] In 1945 he began writing fiction after hours as a way of calming down. That year the story Rider from Nowhere was published in serial form in the magazine Argosy. It formed the basis of Schaefer\\'s first novel, Shane, set in Wyoming, which was published four years later, and which was a great success.[11]\\nWhen he wrote Shane, Schaefer had never traveled farther west than Cleveland, Ohio. The Albuquerque Journal writer Ollie Reed Jr. wrote, “That Schaefer could turn out such a Western before he ever saw the West is a tribute to his dogged research, devotion to facts, and storytelling ability, all honed by his newspaper work.”[12]\\nSchaefer\\'s other westerns included First Blood (1953), The Canyon (1953), Company of Cowards (1957), The Kean Land and Other Stories (1959), Monte Walsh (1963), Heroes Without Glory: Some Goodmen of the Old West (1965), and The Collected Stories of Jack Schaefer (1966).[13] For television, he co-wrote They Went Thataway, an unsold pilot that aired in 1960 as an episode of New Comedy Showcase.[14]\\nSchaefer\\'s personal favorites were Monte Walsh and The Canyon.[15]\\nSchaefer\\'s novel Shane was adapted into the classic 1953 film of the same name starring Alan Ladd, and a short-lived 1966 television series starring David Carradine. When asked whether he’d enjoyed the movie version of Shane, Schaefer referred to Alan Ladd\\'s height, saying, “Yeah, I did, all except for that runt!” At a 1989 ceremony to receive an honorary doctorate from Oberlin, he said Shane was supposed to be \"a dark, deadly, person.\"[16] He had hoped the movie version would be played by the actor George Raft, instead of Alan Ladd.[17]\\nBut he was apparently dismayed by the TV series, saying, “Please take my name off that piece-of-crap show”.[18]\\nIn addition to Shane, seven of his other stories were made into films.[19] Among those, First Blood, was made into the 1953 film The Silver Whip, starring Robert Wagner. Other films included Tribute to a Bad Man with James Cagney, 1956, based on the short story Hanging’s for the Lucky; Trooper Hook, 1957, featuring Joel McCrea and Barbara Stanwyck and adapted from the story Sergeant Houck; and 1964\\'s Advance to the Rear, taken from the 1957 novel Company of Cowards.[20]\\nMonte Walsh was loosely adapted into the 1970 film of the same name starring Lee Marvin, Jeanne Moreau, and Jack Palance,[21] and again as a 2003 television film starring Tom Selleck. Stubby Pringle\\'s Christmas was also adapted into a television film in 1978.\\nToward the end of his life, Schaeffer became increasingly concerned by human impact on the environment. By 1967, after writing “Mavericks,” his last western, Schaeffer became a conservationist. He wrote three essays in the form of conversations with animals. They were published in book form titled Conversations with a Pocket Gopher. His last book, American Bestiary, was published in 1975.[22]\\nSchaefer was married to Eugenia Ives in 1931, and the couple had three sons and a daughter. They divorced in 1948, and a year later Schaefer married Louise Deans.[23]\\nIn 1955, after taking a train trip West on an assignment from Holiday magazine to do some research on old western cow towns Schaefer sold his farm near Waterbury, Connecticut,[24] and moved to a 300-acre ranch[25] near Cerrillos, about 20 miles southwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico called the Turquoise Six.[26] They resided in an old adobe home at 905 Camino Ranchitos, just off of Canyon Rd.\\nSchaefer died of heart failure in Santa Fe in 1991.[27] At the author\\'s graveside service Schaefer\\'s friend Archie West (the inspiration for the character Monte Walsh) read aloud from the last two pages of Monte Walsh, which describe the title character\\'s cowboy burial.[28]\\nIn 1975 Schaefer received the Western Literature Association\\'s Distinguished Achievement award.[29]\\nShane has been translated into 35 languages since it was published in 1949, and was honored by the Western Writers of America as the finest Western novel.[30] Fifty years after its publication, Shane had sold over 12 million copies and been translated into thirty foreign languages.[31]\\nSchaefer\\'s 1960 children\\'s book, Old Ramon, won a Newbery Honor award.[32] It also won the Ohioana Book Award in 1961, and was chosen as an American Library Association Notable book.[33]\\nA 1967 New York Times review of Schaefer\\'s collected novels noted that \"Jack Schaefer is not a writer of conventional westerns,\" instead, they were, \"tautly told and tightly constructed,\" had \"additional ingredients that make for complex storytelling.\"[34]\\n',\n",

Following graduation in 1930, he worked for a number of newspapers before becoming a trapper in Canada. He later moved to New Mexico to be an archeologist\\'s assistant. After reading Western pulp magazines and trying to escape unemployment, he began to write Western fiction. He sold his first short story and novel in 1935 under the pen name of Luke Short (which was also the name of a famous gunslinger in the Old West, although it\\'s unclear if he was aware of that when he assumed the pen name.) His apprenticeship in the pulps was comparatively brief. In 1938, he sold a short story, \"The Warning\", to Collier\\'s, and in 1941, he sold his novel Blood on the Moon, or Gunman\\'s Chance, to The Saturday Evening Post.[1] Some of his later novels were also serialised in the Post.\\nHis first agent was Marguerite E.

The latter arranged to get many of his novels and short stories made into films.\\nAfter publishing over a dozen novels in the 1930s, he started writing for movies in the 1940s.  In 1948 alone, four Luke Short novels appeared as movies. Among his notable film credits are Ramrod (1947) and Blood on the Moon (1948). His novel, The Whip, or Doom Cliff, was serialized in both Collier\\'s and The Saturday Evening Post. The first two parts were published in Collier\\'s in the December 21, 1956, and January 4, 1957, issues. Collier\\'s then ceased publication.

He subsequently became a stagecoach division superintendent along the Central Overland route for Hockaday & Co. (1858–59)[5] and its successors Jones, Russell & Co. (1859)[6] and Central Overland, California & Pike\\'s Peak Express Co. (1859–62).[7] With the latter concern, he also helped launch and operate the Pony Express in 1860-61.[8] All were critical to the communication between the East and California. As superintendent, he enforced order and assured reliable cross-continental mail service, maintaining contact between Washington, DC, and California on the eve of Civil War.\\nWhile division superintendent, he shot and killed Andrew Ferrin, one of his subordinates, who was hindering the progress of a freight train, in May 1859. At the time, shooting deaths of this kind in the West were rare and Jack Slade\\'s reputation as a \"gunfighter\" spread rapidly across the country.[9]\\nIn March 1860, Slade was ambushed and left for dead by Jules Beni, the corrupt stationkeeper at Julesburg, Colorado, whom Slade had removed.[10] Slade remarkably survived, and in August 1861, Beni was killed by Slade\\'s men after ignoring Slade\\'s warning to stay out of his territory.[11]\\nSlade\\'s ferocious reputation, though, combined with a drinking problem, caused his downfall. He was fired by the Central Overland for drunkenness in November 1862.[12] During a drunken spree in Virginia City, Montana, he was lynched by local vigilantes on March 10, 1864, for disturbing the peace.[13] He was buried in Salt Lake City, Utah, on July 20, 1864.[14]\\n\\nSlade\\'s exploits spawned numerous legends, many of them untrue. His image, especially by Mark Twain in Roughing It, as the vicious killer of up to 26 victims was greatly exaggerated. Only one killing by Slade, that of Andrew Ferrin, is undisputed.\\nIn his essay \"Raffles and Miss Blandish,\" the English essayist George Orwell criticized Twain\\'s admiration for Slade, saying that Twain\\'s attitude represented an alleged American tolerance for violent crime.\\nSlade\\'s life was depicted in the 1953 film  movie Jack Slade, with Mark Stevens starring as Slade. Dorothy Malone co-starred as Virginia Maria Dale and Barton MacLane was Jules Beni.  The tagline for the movie was \"Everyone knew the terror of his blazing iron...only she knew the fire in his heart!\" \\nGregg Palmer played Slade in a 1955 episode of the syndicated television series Stories of the Century, starring and narrated by Jim Davis.

       "  '\\nJohn Ernst Steinbeck (/ˈstaɪnbɛk/ STYNE-bek; February 27, 1902\\xa0– December 20, 1968) was an American writer. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humor and keen social perception\".[2] He has been called \"a giant of American letters.\"[3][4]\\nDuring his writing career, he authored 33 books, with one book coauthored alongside Edward Ricketts, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories. He is widely known for the comic novels Tortilla Flat (1935) and Cannery Row (1945), the multigeneration epic East of Eden (1952), and the novellas The Red Pony (1933) and Of Mice and Men (1937). The Pulitzer Prize–winning The Grapes of Wrath (1939)[5] is considered Steinbeck\\'s masterpiece and part of the American literary canon.[6] By the 75th anniversary of its publishing date, it had sold 14 million copies.[7]\\nMuch of Steinbeck\\'s work employs settings in his native central California, particularly in the Salinas Valley and the California Coast Ranges region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or everyman protagonists.\\nSteinbeck was born on February 27, 1902, in Salinas, California.[8] He was of German, English, and Irish descent.[9] Johann Adolf Großsteinbeck (1828–1913), Steinbeck\\'s paternal grandfather, was a founder of Mount Hope, a short-lived farming colony in Palestine that disbanded after Arab attackers killed his brother and raped his brother\\'s wife and mother-in-law.[10] He arrived in the United States in 1858, shortening the family name to Steinbeck. The family farm in Heiligenhaus, Mettmann, Germany, is still named \"Großsteinbeck\".\\nHis father, John Ernst Steinbeck (1862–1935), served as Monterey County treasurer. John\\'s mother, Olive Hamilton (1867–1934), a former school teacher, shared Steinbeck\\'s passion for reading and writing.[11] The Steinbecks were members of the Episcopal Church,[12] although Steinbeck later became agnostic.[13] Steinbeck lived in a small rural valley (no more than a frontier settlement) set in fertile soil, about 25 miles from the Pacific Coast.  Both valley and coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction.[14] He spent his summers working on nearby ranches including the Post Ranch in Big Sur.[15] He later labored with migrant workers on Spreckels sugar beet farms. There he learned of the harsher aspects of the migrant life and the darker side of human nature, which supplied him with material expressed in Of Mice and Men. He explored his surroundings, walking across local forests, fields, and farms.[16] While working at Spreckels Sugar Company, he sometimes worked in their laboratory, which gave him time to write. He had considerable mechanical aptitude and fondness for repairing things he owned.[17]\\nSteinbeck graduated from Salinas High School in 1919 and went on to study English literature at Stanford University near Palo Alto, leaving without a degree in 1925. He traveled to New York City where he took odd jobs while trying to write. When he failed to publish his work, he returned to California and worked in 1928 as a tour guide and caretaker[17] at Lake Tahoe, where he met Carol Henning, his first wife.[11][17][18] They married in January 1930 in Los Angeles, where, with friends, he attempted to make money by manufacturing plaster mannequins.[17]\\nWhen their money ran out six months later due to a slow market, Steinbeck and Carol moved back to Pacific Grove, California, to a cottage owned by his father, on the Monterey Peninsula a few blocks outside the Monterey city limits. The elder Steinbecks gave John free housing, paper for his manuscripts, and from 1928, loans that allowed him to write without looking for work. During the Great Depression, Steinbeck bought a small boat, and later claimed that he was able to live on the fish and crabs that he gathered from the sea, and fresh vegetables from his garden and local farms. When those sources failed, Steinbeck and his wife accepted welfare, and on rare occasions, stole bacon from the local produce market.[17] Whatever food they had, they shared with their friends.[17] Carol became the model for Mary Talbot in Steinbeck\\'s novel Cannery Row.[17]\\nIn 1930, Steinbeck met the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology.[17] Ricketts, usually very quiet, yet likable, with an inner self-sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects, became a focus of Steinbeck\\'s attention. Ricketts had taken a college class from Warder Clyde Allee, a biologist and ecological theorist, who would go on to write a classic early textbook on ecology. Ricketts became a proponent of ecological thinking, in which man was only one part of a great chain of being, caught in a web of life too large for him to control or understand.[17] Meanwhile, Ricketts operated a biological lab on the coast of Monterey, selling biological samples of small animals, fish, rays, starfish, turtles, and other marine forms to schools and colleges.\\nBetween 1930 and 1936, Steinbeck and Ricketts became close friends. Steinbeck\\'s wife began working at the lab as secretary-bookkeeper.[17] Steinbeck helped on an informal basis.[19] They formed a common bond based on their love of music and art, and John learned biology and Ricketts\\'s ecological philosophy.[20] When Steinbeck became emotionally upset, Ricketts sometimes played music for him.[21]\\nSteinbeck\\'s first novel, Cup of Gold, published in 1929, is loosely based on the life and death of privateer Henry Morgan. It centers on Morgan\\'s assault and sacking of Panamá Viejo, sometimes referred to as the \"Cup of Gold\", and on the women, brighter than the sun, who were said to be found there.[22] In 1930, Steinbeck wrote a werewolf murder mystery, Murder at Full Moon, that has never been published because Steinbeck considered it unworthy of publication.[23]\\nBetween 1930 and 1933, Steinbeck produced three shorter works. The Pastures of Heaven, published in 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which was discovered by a Spanish corporal while chasing runaway Indian slaves. In 1933 Steinbeck published The Red Pony, a 100-page, four-chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbeck\\'s childhood.[22] To a God Unknown, named after a Vedic hymn,[17] follows the life of a homesteader and his family in California, depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works.\\nBefore his novel Tortilla Flat (1935), Steinbeck was an obscure writer \"with little success\".[24] Although he had not achieved the status of a well-known writer, he never doubted that he would achieve greatness.[17]\\nSteinbeck achieved his first critical success with Tortilla Flat, a novel set in post-war Monterey, California, that won the California Commonwealth Club\\'s Gold Medal.[22] It portrays the adventures of a group of classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after World War I, just before U.S. prohibition. They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited \"spicy and comic tales about a gang of paisanos, asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur\\'s Knights of the Round Table. It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression.\"[1] Tortilla Flat was adapted as a 1942 film of the same name, starring Spencer Tracy, Hedy Lamarr and John Garfield, a friend of Steinbeck.[25] With some of the proceeds, he built a summer ranch-home in Los Gatos.[citation needed]\\nSteinbeck began to write a series of \"California novels\" and Dust Bowl fiction, set among common people during the Great Depression. These included In Dubious Battle, Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath. He also wrote an article series called The Harvest Gypsies for the San Francisco News about the plight of the migrant worker.\\nOf Mice and Men was a drama about the dreams of two migrant agricultural laborers in California. Steinbeck, on vacations to Mexico, witnessed sold-out theater troupes with often poor and illiterate workers consisting of the audience. As such, Steinbeck chose to write Of Mice and Men with a stage play in mind. It was critically acclaimed[22] and Steinbeck\\'s 1962 Nobel Prize citation called it a \"little masterpiece\".[1]\\nIts stage production was a hit, starring Wallace Ford as George and Broderick Crawford as George\\'s companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie. Steinbeck refused to travel from his home in California to attend any performance of the play during its New York run, telling director George S. Kaufman that the play as it existed in his own mind was \"perfect\" and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment. Steinbeck wrote two more stage plays (The Moon Is Down and Burning Bright).\\nOf Mice and Men was also adapted as a 1939 Hollywood film, with Lon Chaney Jr. as Lennie (he had filled the role in the Los Angeles stage production) and Burgess Meredith as George.[26] Meredith and Steinbeck became close friends for the next two decades.[17] Another film based on the novella was made in 1992 starring Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie.\\nSteinbeck followed this wave of success with The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco. In August 1936, the San Francisco News asked Steinbeck to personally interview multiple families in the impoverished Hoovervilles of the San Joaquin Valley. As Steinbeck visited the slums that hugged the highways across the Central Valley, he was harrowed by what he saw. He talked with multiple families and vowed to make a book depicting their struggles. It is commonly considered his greatest work. According to The New York Times, it was the best-selling book of 1939 and 430,000 copies had been printed by February 1940. In that month, it won the National Book Award, favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association.[27] Later that year, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction[28] and was adapted as a film directed by John Ford, starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad; Fonda was nominated for the best actor Academy Award. Grapes was controversial. Steinbeck\\'s New Deal political views, negative portrayal of aspects of capitalism, and sympathy for the plight of workers, led to a backlash against the author for displaying communist views, especially in his hometown of Salinas.[29]  Steinbeck received so many threats that he purchased a handgun for his own safety. Claiming the book both was obscene and misrepresented conditions in the county, the Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county\\'s publicly funded schools and libraries in August 1939. This ban lasted until January 1941.[30]\\nOf the controversy, Steinbeck wrote, \"The vilification of me out here from the large landowners and bankers is pretty bad. The latest is a rumor started by them that the Okies hate me and have threatened to kill me for lying about them. I\\'m frightened at the rolling might of this damned thing. It is completely out of hand; I mean a kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy.\"[31]\\nThe then First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, already a fan of Steinbeck\\'s work from Of Mice and Men, defended Steinbeck\\'s work in her nationally syndicated newspaper column, \"My Day\". She wrote: \"Now I must tell you that I have just finished a book which is an unforgettable experience in reading. The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, both repels and attracts you. The horrors of the picture, so well drawn, make you dread sometimes to begin the next chapter, and yet you cannot lay the book down or even skip a page.\"[32] After visiting California labor camps in 1940, a reporter asked her if she believed that The Grapes of Wrath was exaggerated. Roosevelt responded, \"I have never believed that The Grapes of Wrath was exaggerated\".[33]\\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Ed Ricketts strongly influenced Steinbeck\\'s writing. Steinbeck frequently took small trips with Ricketts along the California coast to give himself time off from his writing[34] and to collect biological specimens, which Ricketts sold for a living. Their coauthored book, Sea of Cortez (December 1941), about a collecting expedition to the Gulf of California in 1940, which was part travelogue and part natural history, published just as the U.S. entered World War II, never found an audience and did not sell well.[34] However, in 1951, Steinbeck republished the narrative portion of the book as The Log from the Sea of Cortez, under his name only (though Ricketts had written some of it). This work remains in print today.[35]\\nAlthough Carol accompanied Steinbeck on the trip, their marriage was beginning to suffer, and ended a year later, in 1941, even as Steinbeck worked on the manuscript for the book.[17] In 1942, after his divorce from Carol he married Gwyndolyn \"Gwyn\" Conger.[36]\\nRicketts was Steinbeck\\'s model for the character of \"Doc\" in Cannery Row (1945) and Sweet Thursday (1954), \"Friend Ed\" in Burning Bright, and characters in In Dubious Battle (1936) and The Grapes of Wrath (1939). Ecological themes recur in Steinbeck\\'s novels of the period.[37]\\nSteinbeck\\'s close relations with Ricketts ended in 1941 when Steinbeck moved away from Pacific Grove and divorced his wife Carol.[34] Ricketts\\'s biographer Eric Enno Tamm opined that, except for East of Eden (1952), Steinbeck\\'s writing declined after Ricketts\\'s untimely death in 1948.[37]\\nSteinbeck\\'s novel The Moon Is Down (1942), about the Socrates-inspired spirit of resistance in an occupied village in Northern Europe, was made into a film almost immediately. It was presumed that the unnamed country of the novel was Norway and the occupiers the Germans. In 1945, Steinbeck received the King Haakon VII Freedom Cross for his literary contributions to the Norwegian resistance movement.[38]\\nIn 1943, Steinbeck served as a World War II war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune and worked with the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the CIA).[39] It was at that time he became friends with Will Lang Jr. of Time/Life magazine. During the war, Steinbeck accompanied the commando raids of Douglas Fairbanks Jr.\\'s Beach Jumpers program, which launched small-unit diversion operations against German-held islands in the Mediterranean. At one point, he accompanied Fairbanks on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and used a Thompson submachine gun to help capture Italian and German prisoners. Some of his writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary Once There Was a War (1958).\\nSteinbeck returned from the war with a number of wounds from shrapnel and some psychological trauma. He treated himself, as ever, by writing.[40] He wrote Alfred Hitchcock\\'s movie, Lifeboat (1944), and with screenwriter Jack Wagner, A Medal for Benny (1945), about paisanos from Tortilla Flat going to war. He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of Lifeboat, because he believed the final version of the film had racist undertones. In 1944, bruised, battered, and homesick, Steinbeck wrote Cannery Row (1945), a love letter to the city of Monterey. In 1958, Ocean View Avenue in Monterey, the setting of the book, was renamed Cannery Row in his honor.\\nAfter the war, he wrote The Pearl (1947), knowing it would be filmed eventually. Steinbeck\\'s relationship with Hollywood had solidified to the point where his books were being green-lit as movies as they released. The story first appeared in the December 1945 issue of Woman\\'s Home Companion magazine as \"The Pearl of the World\". It was illustrated by John Alan Maxwell. The novel is an imaginative telling of a story which Steinbeck had heard in La Paz in 1940, as related in The Log From the Sea of Cortez, which he described in Chapter 11 as being \"so much like a parable that it almost can\\'t be\". Steinbeck traveled to Cuernavaca,[41] Mexico for the filming with Wagner who helped with the script; on this trip he would be inspired by the story of Emiliano Zapata, and subsequently wrote a film script (Viva Zapata!) directed by Elia Kazan and starring Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn.\\nIn 1947, Steinbeck made his first trip to the Soviet Union with photographer Robert Capa. They visited Moscow, Kyiv, Tbilisi, Batumi and Stalingrad, some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the communist revolution. Steinbeck\\'s 1948 book about their experiences, A Russian Journal, was illustrated with Capa\\'s photos. In 1948, the year the book was published, Steinbeck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\\nOver the course of 276 days in 1952, Steinbeck wrote the first draft of East of Eden, a book he considered his ultimate test as a writer. He wrote a daily letter to his editor while writing the book. Through them, Steinbeck explored himself, his creative process, his love for writing, and his family life, for he had just married his third wife, Elaine Scott, the year prior. Steinbeck, according to Elaine Scott, considered East of Eden his magnum opus, his greatest novel. As the book was released, he wrote to John Beskow, a Swedish artist and a confidant of his: \"I have put all the things I have wanted to write all my life. This is \\'the book\\'... having done this, I can do anything I want\".[17] Also in 1952, John Steinbeck appeared as the on-screen narrator of 20th Century Fox\\'s film, O. Henry\\'s Full House. Although Steinbeck later admitted he was uncomfortable before the camera, he provided interesting introductions to several filmed adaptations of short stories by the legendary writer O. Henry. About the same time, Steinbeck recorded readings of several of his short stories for Columbia Records;  the recordings provide a record of Steinbeck\\'s deep, resonant voice.\\nFollowing the success of Viva Zapata!, Steinbeck collaborated with Kazan on the 1955 film East of Eden, James Dean\\'s movie debut. Jack Moffitt of The Hollywood Reporter, in a review that appeared after the March 1955 premiere, wrote \"Beautifully acted, and superbly directed by Elia Kazan, it is bound to be one of the year’s important contributions to screen literature.\"[42]\\nFrom March to October 1959, Steinbeck and his third wife Elaine rented a cottage in the hamlet of Discove, Redlynch, near Bruton in Somerset, England, while Steinbeck researched his retelling of the Arthurian legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Glastonbury Tor was visible from the cottage, and Steinbeck also visited the nearby hillfort of Cadbury Castle, the supposed site of King Arthur\\'s court of Camelot. The unfinished manuscript was published after his death in 1976, as The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights. Steinbeck grew up enthralled by the stories of King Arthur, and the Steinbecks recounted the time spent in Somerset as the happiest of their life together.[43][44]\\nTravels with Charley: In Search of America is a travelogue of his 1960 road trip with his poodle Charley. Steinbeck bemoans his lost youth and roots, while dispensing both criticism and praise for the United States. According to Steinbeck\\'s son Thom, Steinbeck made the journey because he knew he was dying and wanted to see the country one last time.[45]\\nSteinbeck\\'s last novel, The Winter of Our Discontent (1961), examines moral decline in the United States. The protagonist Ethan grows discontented with his own moral decline and that of those around him.[46] The book has a very different tone from Steinbeck\\'s amoral and ecological stance in earlier works such as Tortilla Flat and Cannery Row. It was not a critical success. Many reviewers recognized the importance of the novel but were disappointed that it was not another Grapes of Wrath.[46]\\nIn the Nobel Prize presentation speech the next year, however, the Swedish Academy cited it most favorably: \"Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of Wrath. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad.\"[1]\\nApparently taken aback by the critical reception of this novel, and the critical outcry when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962,[47] Steinbeck published no more fiction in the remaining six years before his death.\\nIn 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature for his \"realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception\". The selection was heavily criticized, and described as \"one of the Academy\\'s biggest mistakes\" in one Swedish newspaper.[47] The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\", noting that \"[T]he international character of the award and the weight attached to it raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing. ... [W]e think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age\".[47] Steinbeck, when asked on the day of the announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: \"Frankly, no.\"[17][47] Biographer Jackson Benson notes, \"[T]his honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver. It was precisely because the committee made its judgment ... on its own criteria, rather than plugging into \\'the main currents of American writing\\' as defined by the critical establishment, that the award had value.\"[17][47] In his acceptance speech later in the year in Stockholm, he said:\\nthe writer is delegated to declare and to celebrate man\\'s proven capacity for greatness of heart and spirit—for gallantry in defeat, for courage, compassion and love. In the endless war against weakness and despair, these are the bright rally flags of hope and of emulation. I hold that a writer who does not believe in the perfectibility of man has no dedication nor any membership in literature.Fifty years later, in 2012, the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a \"compromise choice\" among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck, British authors Robert Graves and Lawrence Durrell, French dramatist Jean Anouilh and Danish author Karen Blixen.[47] The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot.[47] \"There aren\\'t any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation,\" wrote committee member Henry Olsson.[47] Although the committee believed Steinbeck\\'s best work was behind him by 1962, committee member Anders Österling believed the release of his novel The Winter of Our Discontent showed that \"after some signs of slowing down in recent years, [Steinbeck has] regained his position as a social truth-teller [and is an] authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway.\"[47]\\nAlthough modest about his own talent as a writer, Steinbeck talked openly of his own admiration of certain writers. In 1953, he wrote that he considered cartoonist Al Capp, creator of the satirical Li\\'l Abner, \"possibly the best writer in the world today\".[49] At his own first Nobel Prize press conference he was asked his favorite authors and works and replied: \"Hemingway\\'s short stories and nearly everything Faulkner wrote.\"[17]\\nIn September 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Steinbeck the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[50]\\nIn 1967, at the behest of Newsday magazine, Steinbeck went to Vietnam to report on the war. He thought of the Vietnam War as a heroic venture and was considered a hawk for his position on the war. His sons served in Vietnam before his death, and Steinbeck visited one son in the battlefield.  At one point he was allowed to man a machine-gun watch position at night at a firebase while his son and other members of his platoon slept.[51]\\nSteinbeck and his first wife, Carol Henning, married in January 1930 in Los Angeles.[11] By 1940, their marriage was beginning to suffer, and it ended a year later.[17] In 1942, after his divorce from Carol, Steinbeck married Gwyndolyn \"Gwyn\" Conger.[36] With his second wife Steinbeck had two sons, Thomas (\"Thom\") Myles Steinbeck (1944–2016) and John Steinbeck IV (1946–1991).\\nIn May 1948, Steinbeck returned to California on an emergency trip to be with his friend Ed Ricketts, who had been seriously injured when a train struck his car. Ricketts died hours before Steinbeck arrived. Upon returning home, Steinbeck was confronted by Gwyn, who asked for a divorce, which became final in October. Steinbeck spent the year after Ricketts\\'s death in deep depression.\\nIn June 1949, Steinbeck met stage manager Elaine Scott at a restaurant in Carmel, California. Steinbeck and Scott eventually began a relationship, and in December 1950 they married, within a week of Scott\\'s finalizing her own divorce from actor Zachary Scott. This third marriage for Steinbeck lasted until his death in 1968.[22]\\nSteinbeck was an acquaintance of modernist poet Robinson Jeffers, a Californian neighbor. In a letter to Elizabeth Otis, Steinbeck wrote: \"Robinson Jeffers and his wife came in to call the other day. He looks a little older but that is all. And she is just the same.\"[52]\\nIn 1962, Steinbeck began acting as friend and mentor to the young writer and naturalist Jack Rudloe, who was trying to establish his own biological supply company, now Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory in Florida. Their correspondence continued until Steinbeck\\'s death.[53]\\nIn February 1966, Steinbeck and his wife traveled to Israel.[54] He visited in Tel Aviv the site of Mount Hope, a farm community established by his grandfather, whose brother, Friedrich Großsteinbeck, had been murdered by Arab marauders in 1858 during the Outrages at Jaffa.[55]\\nJohn Steinbeck died in New York City, where his writing career had begun, on December 20, 1968, during the 1968 flu pandemic of heart disease and congestive heart failure. He was 66, and had been a lifelong smoker. An autopsy showed nearly complete occlusion of the main coronary arteries.[22]\\nIn accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and interred on March 4, 1969[56] at the Hamilton family gravesite in Salinas, with those of his parents and maternal grandparents. His third wife, Elaine, was buried in the plot in 2004. He had written to his doctor that he felt deeply \"in his flesh\" that he would not survive his physical death, and that the biological end of his life was the final end to it.[34]\\nSteinbeck\\'s incomplete novel based on the King Arthur legends of Malory and others, The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights, was  published in 1976.\\nMany of Steinbeck\\'s works are required reading in American high schools. In England, Of Mice and Men was one of the key texts used by the examining body AQA for its English Literature GCSE until its removal from the reformed specification that was first examined in June 2018. The text is still widely studied by GCSE students in Wales and Northern Ireland, although calls have been made for its removal in Northern Ireland[57] due to concerns about the use of racial slurs in the text. A study by the Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature in the United States found that Of Mice and Men was one of the ten most frequently read books in public high schools.[58] Steinbeck\\'s works have also been banned. The Grapes of Wrath was banned in August 1939 by the Kern County Board of Supervisors from the county\\'s publicly funded schools and libraries.[30] It was burned in Salinas on two occasions.[59][60] In 2003, a school board in Mississippi banned it on the grounds of profanity.[61] According to the American Library Association, Steinbeck was one of the ten most frequently banned authors from 1990 to 2004, with Of Mice and Men ranking sixth out of 100 such books in the United States.[62][63]\\nSteinbeck grew up in California\\'s Salinas Valley, a culturally diverse place with a rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct sense of place.[16][22]\\nSalinas, Monterey and parts of the San Joaquin Valley were the setting for many of his stories. The area is now sometimes referred to as \"Steinbeck Country\".[34] Most of his early work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel, Cup of Gold, which concerns the pirate/privateer Henry Morgan, whose adventures had captured Steinbeck\\'s imagination as a child.\\nIn his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. His childhood friend, Max Wagner, a brother of Jack Wagner and who later became a film actor, served as inspiration for The Red Pony. Later he used actual American conditions and events in the first half of the 20th century, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.\\nHis later work reflected his wide range of interests, including marine biology, politics, religion, history and mythology. One of his last published works was Travels with Charley, a travelogue of a road trip he took in 1960 to rediscover America.\\nSteinbeck\\'s boyhood home, a turreted Victorian building in downtown Salinas, has been preserved and restored by the Valley Guild, a nonprofit organization. Fixed menu lunches are served Monday through Saturday, and the house is open for tours on Sunday afternoons during the summer.[64]\\nThe National Steinbeck Center is two blocks away at 1 Main Street. Dana Gioia (chair of the National Endowment for the Arts) told an audience at the center, \"This is really the best modern literary shrine in the country, and I\\'ve seen them all.\"[citation needed] Its \"Steinbeckiana\" includes \"Rocinante\", the camper-truck in which Steinbeck made the cross-country trip described in Travels with Charley.\\nHis father\\'s cottage on Eleventh Street in Pacific Grove, where Steinbeck wrote some of his earliest books, also survives.[34]\\nIn Monterey, Ed Ricketts\\'s laboratory survives (though it is not yet open to the public), and at the corner that Steinbeck describes in Cannery Row, also the store that once belonged to Lee Chong and the adjacent vacant lot frequented by the hoboes of Cannery Row. The site of the Hovden Sardine Cannery next to Doc\\'s laboratory is now occupied by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. In 1958, the street that Steinbeck described as \"Cannery Row\" in the novel, once named Ocean View Avenue, was renamed Cannery Row in honor of the novel. The town of Monterey has commemorated Steinbeck\\'s work with an avenue of flags depicting characters from Cannery Row, historical plaques, and sculptured busts depicting Steinbeck and Ricketts.[34]\\nOn February 27, 1979 (the 77th anniversary of the writer\\'s birth), the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring Steinbeck, starting the Postal Service\\'s Literary Arts series honoring American writers.[65]\\nSteinbeck was inducted in to the DeMolay International Hall of Fame in 1995.[66]\\nOn December 5, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Steinbeck into the California Hall of Fame, located at the California Museum for History, Women and the Arts.[67] His son, author Thomas Steinbeck, accepted the award on his behalf.\\nMonterey Bay Roller Derby was founded in 2010. Their team names over the years have referenced Steinbeck, including Beasts of Eden, Cannery Rollers, Steinwreckers and Babes of Wrath. Their juniors league was known as the Dread Ponies.\\nTo commemorate the 112th anniversary of Steinbeck\\'s birthday on February 27, 2014, Google displayed an interactive doodle utilizing animation which included illustrations portraying scenes and quotes from several novels by the author.[68][69][70]\\nSteinbeck and his friend Ed Ricketts appear as fictionalized characters in the 2016 novel, Monterey Bay about the founding of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, by Lindsay Hatton (Penguin Press).[71]\\nIn February 2016, Caltrans installed signage to identify a five-mile segment of U.S. Route 101 in Salinas as the John Steinbeck Highway, in accordance with a 2014 state legislative resolution.[72]\\nIn 2019 the Sag Harbor town board approved the creation of the John Steinbeck Waterfront Park across from the iconic town windmill. The structures on the parcel were demolished and park benches installed near the beach. The Beebe windmill replica already had a plaque memorializing the author who wrote from a small hut overlooking the cove during his sojourn in the literary haven.\\nSteinbeck was affiliated to the St. Paul\\'s Episcopal Church and he stayed attached throughout his life to Episcopalianism although Steinbeck later became agnostic.[13] Especially in his works of fiction, Steinbeck was highly conscious of religion and incorporated it into his style and themes. The shaping of his characters often drew on the Bible and the theology of Anglicanism, combining elements of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.[73][74]\\nSteinbeck distanced himself from religious views when he left Salinas for Stanford. However, the work he produced still reflected the language of his childhood at Salinas, and his beliefs remained a powerful influence within his fiction and non-fiction work. William Ray considered his Episcopal views are prominently displayed in The Grapes of Wrath, in which themes of conversion and self-sacrifice play a major part in the characters Casy and Tom, who achieve spiritual transcendence through conversion.[75]\\nSteinbeck\\'s contacts with leftist authors, journalists, and labor union figures may have influenced his writing.  He joined the League of American Writers, a Communist organization, in 1935.[76] Steinbeck was mentored by radical writers Lincoln Steffens and his wife Ella Winter. Through Francis Whitaker, a member of the Communist Party USA\\'s John Reed Club for writers, Steinbeck met with strike organizers from the Cannery and Agricultural Workers\\' Industrial Union.[77] In 1939, he signed a letter with some other writers in support of the Soviet invasion of Finland and the Soviet-established puppet government.[78]\\nDocuments released by the Central Intelligence Agency in 2012 indicate that Steinbeck offered his services to the Agency in 1952, while planning a European tour, and the Director of Central Intelligence, Walter Bedell Smith, was eager to take him up on the offer.[79]  What work, if any, Steinbeck may have performed for the CIA during the Cold War is unknown. Documents released by the Security Service of Ukraine following the Revolution of Dignity in 2014 indicate that the Soviet KGB suspected him of being an American agent when he visited locations within the USSR, including Kyiv, in 1947. Consequently, they watched Steinbeck closely and solicited information about him from their informers.[citation needed]\\nSteinbeck was a close associate of playwright Arthur Miller. In June 1957, Steinbeck took a personal and professional risk by supporting him when Miller refused to name names in the House Un-American Activities Committee trials.[59] Steinbeck called the period one of the \"strangest and most frightening times a government and people have ever faced\".[59]\\nIn 1963, Steinbeck visited the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic at the behest of President John F. Kennedy. During his visit he sat for a rare portrait by painter Martiros Saryan and visited Geghard Monastery. He also met with Armenian poet Hovhannes Shiraz in Yerevan. Steinbeck\\'s letter of thanks for Shiraz\\'s hospitality is now displayed at the Shiraz house museum in Gyumri.[80] Footage of this visit filmed by Rafael Aramyan was sold in 2013 by his granddaughter.[81]\\nIn 1967, when he was sent to Vietnam to report on the war, his sympathetic portrayal of the United States Army led the New York Post to denounce him for betraying his leftist past. Steinbeck\\'s biographer, Jay Parini, says Steinbeck\\'s friendship with President Lyndon B. Johnson[82] influenced his views on Vietnam.[22] Steinbeck may also have been concerned about the safety of his son serving in Vietnam.[83] Steinbeck opposed the anti-war movement in the United states, denouncing the \"fallout, drop-out, cop-out insurgency of our children and young people, the rush to stimulant as well as hypnotic drugs, the rise of narrow, ugly, and vengeful cults of all kinds, the mistrust and revolt against all authority – this in a time of plenty such as has never been known.\"[84]\\nAlong with Albert Einstein, Steinbeck was one of the sponsors of the Peoples\\' World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples\\' World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950–51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland.[85][86]\\nSteinbeck complained publicly about government harassment.[87] Thomas Steinbeck, the author\\'s eldest son, said that J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI at the time, could find no basis for prosecuting Steinbeck and therefore used his power to encourage the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to audit Steinbeck\\'s taxes every single year of his life, just to annoy him. According to Thomas, a true artist is one who \"without a thought for self, stands up against the stones of condemnation, and speaks for those who are given no real voice in the halls of justice, or the halls of government. By doing so, these people will naturally become the enemies of the political status quo.\"[88]\\nIn a 1942 letter to United States Attorney General Francis Biddle, John Steinbeck wrote: \"Do you suppose you could ask Edgar\\'s boys to stop stepping on my heels? They think I am an enemy alien. It is getting tiresome.\"[89] The FBI denied that Steinbeck was under investigation.[90]\\nSteinbeck\\'s first commercial success, published in 1935, is an episodic fiction recounting adventures of a loosely attached group of delinquent locals in a shabby coastal district of California. Like other books of Steinbeck\\'s, Tortilla Flat was adapted into a feature film.[91]\\nIn 1936, Steinbeck published the first of what came to be known as his Dust Bowl trilogy, which included Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath. This first novel tells the story of a fruit pickers\\' strike in California which is both aided and damaged by the help of \"the Party\", generally taken to be the Communist Party, although this is never spelled out in the book.\\nOf Mice and Men is a 1937 tragic novel that Steinbeck rewrote as a play that same year. The story is about two traveling ranch workers, George and Lennie, trying to earn enough money to buy their own farm/ranch. As it is set in 1930s America, it provides an insight into The Great Depression, encompassing themes of racism, loneliness, prejudice against the mentally ill, and the struggle for personal independence. Along with The Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, and The Pearl, Of Mice and Men is one of Steinbeck\\'s best known works. It was made into movies three times: in 1939, starring Burgess Meredith, Lon Chaney Jr., and Betty Field; in 1981, starring Randy Quaid, Robert Blake and Ted Neeley; and in 1992, starring Gary Sinise and John Malkovich.\\nThe Grapes of Wrath was published during the Great Depression and had a contemporary setting, describing a family of sharecroppers, the Joads, who were driven from their land by the dust storms of the Dust Bowl. The title is a reference to the Battle Hymn of the Republic. Some critics found it too sympathetic to the workers\\' plight and too critical of capitalism,[92] but it found a large audience of its own. It won both the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for fiction (novels) and was adapted as a film starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell and directed by John Ford.\\nThe 1945 novel tells of a marine biologist in a seedy district dotted with sardine canneries in Monterey, California, who is feted by colorful neighbors in gratitude for his kindness to them. Cannery Row and its sequel, Sweet Thursday, were adapted into a movie in 1982.\\nSteinbeck deals with the nature of good and evil in this 1952 Salinas Valley saga. The story follows two families: the Hamiltons\\xa0– based on Steinbeck\\'s own maternal ancestry[93]\\xa0– and the Trasks, reprising stories about the biblical Adam and his progeny. His paternal ancestry is also reflected in the story.[94] The book was published in 1952. Portions of the novel were made into a 1955 movie directed by Elia Kazan and starring James Dean.\\nIn 1960, Steinbeck bought a pickup truck and had it modified with a custom-built camper top\\xa0– which was rare at the time\\xa0– and drove across the United States with his faithful \"blue\" standard poodle, Charley. Steinbeck nicknamed his truck Rocinante after Don Quixote\\'s \"noble steed\". In this sometimes comical, sometimes melancholic book, Steinbeck describes what he sees as he travels from Maine to Montana to California, and from there to Texas and Louisiana and back to his home on Long Island. However, in 2011, after his death, a reporter who had followed Travels with Charley\\'s trail using the author\\'s own diaries controverted the book\\'s accuracy, casting Steinbeck\\'s claimed reportage as largely fictionalized, allegations supported by scholars and Steinbeck\\'s son John.\\nThe restored camper truck is on exhibit in the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWallace Earle Stegner (February 18, 1909 – April 13, 1993) was an American novelist, writer, environmentalist, and historian. He was often called \"The Dean of Western Writers\".[1] He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1972[2] and the U.S. National Book Award in 1977.[3]\\nStegner was born in Lake Mills, Iowa, and grew up in Great Falls, Montana; Salt Lake City, Utah; and the village of  Eastend, Saskatchewan, which he wrote about in his autobiography Wolf Willow. Stegner says he \"lived in twenty places in eight states and Canada\".[4] He was the son of Hilda (née Paulson) and George Stegner.[5][6][7] Stegner summered in Greensboro, Vermont. While living in Utah, he joined a Boy Scout troop at an LDS Church (although he himself was a Lutheran) and earned the Eagle Scout award. He received a B.A. at the University of Utah in 1930. While at the University of Utah he was initiated into Sigma Nu fraternity. He was inducted into the Sigma Nu Hall of Honor at the 68th Grand Chapter in Washington D.C. He also studied at the University of Iowa, where he received a master\\'s degree in 1932 and a doctorate in 1935.[8]\\nIn 1934, Stegner married Mary Stuart Page. For 59 years they shared a \"personal literary partnership of singular facility,\" in the words of Arthur Schlesinger Jr.[9] Stegner died in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on April 13, 1993, as the result of a car accident on March 28, 1993.[8]\\nStegner\\'s son, Page Stegner, was a novelist, essayist, nature writer and professor emeritus at University of California, Santa Cruz. Page was married to Lynn Stegner, a novelist.[10][11] Page co-authored American Places and edited the 2008 Collected Letters of Wallace Stegner.[12] He was Thomas Heggen\\'s cousin.[13][14]\\nIn the 1940s, Stegner was a leading member of the Peninsula Housing Association, a group of locals in Palo Alto aiming to build a large co-operative housing complex for Stanford University faculty and staff on a 260-acre ranch the group had purchased near campus.[15] Private lenders and the Federal Housing Authority would not provide financing to the group because three of the families were African-American. Rather than be a party to housing discrimination by proceeding without these families, the group abandoned the project and eventually sold the land.\\nStegner taught at the University of Wisconsin and Harvard University.  Eventually he settled at Stanford University, where he founded the creative writing program. His students included Wendell Berry, Sandra Day O\\'Connor, Edward Abbey, Simin Daneshvar, Andrew Glaze, George V. Higgins, Thomas McGuane, Robert Stone, Ken Kesey, Gordon Lish, Ernest Gaines, and Larry McMurtry. He served as a special assistant to Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall and was elected to the Sierra Club\\'s board of directors for a term that lasted 1964–1966. He also moved into a house near Matadero Creek on Three Forks Road in nearby Los Altos Hills and became one of the town\\'s most prominent residents. In 1962, he co-founded the Committee for Green Foothills, an environmental organization dedicated to preserving and protecting the hills, forests, creeks, wetlands and coastal lands of the San Francisco Peninsula.[16]\\nStegner\\'s novel Angle of Repose (first published by Doubleday in early 1971) won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1972.[2] It was based on the letters of Mary Hallock Foote (first published in 1972 by Huntington Library Press as the memoir A Victorian Gentlewoman in the Far West). Stegner explained his use of unpublished archival letters briefly at the beginning of Angle of Repose but his use of uncredited passages taken directly from Foote\\'s letters caused a continuing controversy.[17][18]\\nIn 1977 Stegner won the National Book Award for The Spectator Bird.[3] In 1992, he refused a National Medal from the National Endowment for the Arts because he believed the NEA had become too politicized. Stegner\\'s semi-autobiographical novel Crossing to Safety (1987) gained broad literary acclaim and commercial popularity.\\nStegner\\'s non-fiction works include Beyond the Hundredth Meridian: John Wesley Powell and the Second Opening of the West (1954), a biography of John Wesley Powell, the first white man to explore the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. Powell later served as a government scientist and was an advocate of water conservation in the American West. Stegner wrote the foreword to and edited This Is Dinosaur, with photographs by Philip Hyde. The Sierra Club book was used in the campaign to prevent dams in Dinosaur National Monument and helped launch the modern environmental movement. A substantial number of Stegner\\'s works are set in and around Greensboro, Vermont, where he lived part-time. Some of his character representations (particularly in Second Growth) were sufficiently unflattering that residents took offense, and he did not visit Greensboro for several years after its publication.[19]\\nOn the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Stegner\\'s birth, Timothy Egan reflected in The New York Times on the writer\\'s legacy, including his perhaps troubled relationship with the newspaper itself. Over 100 readers including Jane Smiley offered comments on the subject.[20]\\nIn recognition of Stegner\\'s legacy at the University of Utah, The Wallace Stegner Prize in Environmental or American Western History was established in 2010 and is administered by the University of Utah Press. This book publication prize is awarded to the best monograph the Press receives on the topic of American western or environmental history within a predetermined time period.[21]\\nLewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho, has a history of presenting an annual lecture titled after Stegner. The Wallace Stegner Lecture has long been a literary-cultural highlight for the LCSC community. The annual lecture features discussions about the writer\\'s relationship with the physical and psychological territories in which he or she resides.\\nThe Stegner Fellowship program at Stanford University is a two-year creative writing fellowship. The house Stegner lived in from age 7 to 12 in Eastend, Saskatchewan, Canada, was restored by the Eastend Arts Council in 1990 and established as a Residence for Artists; the Wallace Stegner Grant For The Arts offers a grant of $500 and free residency at the house for the month of October for published Canadian writers.[22] In 2003, the indie rock trio Mambo Sons released the Stegner-influenced song \"Little Live Thing / Cross to Safety\" written by Scott Lawson and Tom Guerra, which resulted in an invitation for Lawson to serve as Artist-in-Residency for March 2009.\\nIn 2005, the Los Altos History Museum mounted an exhibition entitled \"Wallace Stegner: Throwing a Long Shadow\" providing a retrospective of the author\\'s life and works.\\nIn May 2011, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Stegner\\'s Los Altos Hills home, which was sold in 2005, was scheduled to be demolished by the current owners. Lynn Stegner said the family attempted to sell the home to Stanford University in an attempt to preserve it, but the university said the home would be sold at market value, customary for real estate donated to Stanford. Wallace Stegner\\'s wife, Mary, said that Wallace would disapprove of the fuss surrounding the issue.[23] Wallace initially opposed the creation of a hiking path near his home but Mary Stegner confided that her husband later came to enjoy walking on it, and the path was eventually named for him posthumously, in 2008.[24]\\nIn August 2016 a public charter school called the Wallace Stegner Academy opened in Salt Lake City, Utah.[25] The school was named after Wallace Stegner because the founders valued people like Stegner who are devoted to academics and pursue the advancement of knowledge and art throughout their entire lives.\\nThe Wallace Earle Stegner papers (Ms0676), 1935–2004, can be found at the University of Utah Marriott Library Special Collections Manuscripts Division.

       "  'Gary Svee (1943 – July 14, 2019)[2]) was an American author and journalist, known for his Westerns.  He was born in Billings, Montana, growing up on the banks of the Yellowstone, Rosebud and Stillwater rivers,[3] and was a graduate of the University of Montana\\'s School of Journalism.[4]\\nSvee was a former editorial director for the Billings (Montana) Gazette.  He was on the newspaper\\'s staff in 1993, when the town suffered a wave of vicious racial and religious hatred.[5] Citizens who attended a Martin Luther King Jr. Day commemoration returned to their cars to find racist literature on them. Swastikas were painted on a Native American family\\'s home, Ku Klux Klan flyers were openly distributed, the Billings Jewish cemetery was desecrated and a brick was hurled through the window of a Jewish family whose six-year-old son put the family\\'s Menorah in it for Hanukkah.[6][7]\\nThe people of Billings banded together, with volunteers re-painting the home and ridding it of the hate-filled graffiti; religious groups held marches and those who were not members of a particular religion began attending other services in addition to their own, to show unity and support for each other. The Billings Gazette printed a full page depiction of a Menorah,[8] asking residents to put the page up in their businesses and homes.[6][7]  Svee related how the image was chosen for the paper, saying, \"I guess it was a question of looking for an image to put this together. During the second World War, the Danish King is reputed to have come out after the Jewish community was forced to wear stars by the Nazi occupiers, that he was reported to have come out with a yellow star too.\"[7]\\nWhile hundreds of residents displayed the newspaper\\'s Menorah, the incidents were still occurring.  The Billings Chief of Police, Gary Inman, issued a challenge to the town\\'s citizens: for every instance of vandalism, ten more people should display the picture of the Menorah; by the end of December, 1993, there were over 10,000 Menorah images openly displayed in the town. The wave of hatred ended.[7] Svee was one of those who worked with the Institute of Peace at Rocky Mountain College to start the Festival of Cultures in Billings, which offers residents an opportunity to both celebrate their heritage and learn about the heritage of others.[6]\\nSvee, a fiction adviser to the Saturday Evening Post, credited his writing ability to being raised in a family of storytellers, and to his mentor and teacher at the University of Montana, Dorothy M.

       "  '\\nGlendon Fred Swarthout (April 8, 1918 – September 23, 1992) was an American writer and novelist.[1]\\nSeveral of his novels were made into films. Where the Boys Are, and The Shootist, which was John Wayne\\'s last work, are probably the best known.\\nGlendon Swarthout was the only child of Fred and Lila (Chubb) Swarthout, a banker and a homemaker. Swarthout is a Dutch name; his mother\\'s maiden name was from Yorkshire. Swarthout generally did well in school, especially in English. He was a Michigan high-school debate champion.\\nIn math, however, he floundered, and only a kindly lady geometry teacher passed him with a D, so he could graduate from Lowell, Michigan High School.[citation needed]\\nHe took accordion lessons and occupied his free time with books, for at 6 feet, 99 pounds, he was not good at sports. The summer of his junior year, he got a job playing his instrument in the resort town of Charlevoix, on Lake Michigan, with Jerry Schroeder and his Michigan State College Orchestra, for $10 per week [citation needed].\\nGraduating in 1935, he relocated to Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan (UM). He became more seriously involved in music, forming and singing lead for a four-piece band that played for hops and for three consecutive summers at the Pantlind Hotel in Grand Rapids, the largest hotel in Michigan outside of Detroit.\\nGlendon majored in English at the UM, pledged Chi Phi, and dated Kathryn Vaughn, whom he had met when he was 13 and she 12, \\nat her family\\'s cottage on Duck Lake, outside of Albion, Michigan. They were married on December 28, 1940, after both had graduated from UM and Swarthout was writing advertising copy for Cadillac and Dow Chemical at the MacManus, John and Adams advertising agency in Detroit.\\nAfter a year in the advertising business, Swarthout decided the way to become a writer was to see the world as a journalist. He signed as a stringer for 22 small newspapers and travelled with his bride on a small freighter to South America, sending home a weekly column of their adventures. While in Barbados, they heard Pearl Harbor had been bombed and tried immediately to get to the States, but they needed five roundabout months avoiding German U-boats to cruise the East Coast to Manhattan.\\nSwarthout was ineligible for Officer Candidate School because he was underweight at 117 pounds.  The couple both went to work at Willow Run, the new bomber plant outside of Ann Arbor. Working long days as a riveter on B-24s, he wrote his first novel at night in six months. Willow Run, a story about people working in a bomber factory, was published after a rewrite to mediocre reviews.  He always saw this book as his training novel.\\nHe was fit enough for an infantry company, however, as the war wore on, and he enlisted in the Army and was sent to Naples as a replacement for the 3rd Division. Awaiting the Anzio breakout on the beach in Italy, he was transferred to division headquarters. The 3rd Division moved out of Anzio and captured Rome, and Swarthout later landed in the second wave at St. Tropez and saw his only combat for six days,  getting eyewitness statements for a few posthumous Medals of Honor as the unit moved rapidly north into France. When the 3rd Division was about to invade Germany, Swarthout ruptured a disc in his spine while unloading a truck. He was shipped home a sergeant and eventually discharged without surgery. Glendon suffered back pain for the rest of his life and received military disability. He eventually had back surgery in Arizona in his 50s on two imploded spinal discs.\\nSwarthout returned to UM, earned a master\\'s degree, and began teaching college. During that time, his son Miles was born and he won a Hopwood Award for $800 for another novel, promoting him to the University of Maryland for a few years, where he ghost-wrote speeches for Congressmen and wrote more unpublished fiction. That autumn, he began teaching at Michigan State University and during eight years in East Lansing earned his PhD in Victorian literature in 1955, while his wife got her master\\'s degree and a teaching certificate and commenced teaching children in the second grade.\\nSwarthout also began to sell short stories to national publications such as Cosmopolitan and The Saturday Evening Post. He was paid $2500 in 1955 for one of these stories, \"A Horse for Mrs. Custer\", which became a Randolph Scott low-budget Western for Columbia Pictures in 1956, under the title 7th Cavalry. The day after he finished his last doctoral examination, he started writing a novel called They Came To Cordura. Its setting was Mexico of 1916 during the Pershing Expedition to capture Pancho Villa, and some of its fictional cavalry troopers had been nominated for Medals of Honor. The book was quickly sold to Random House and then to Columbia Pictures in 1958, becoming one of their major motion pictures starring Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth a year later. This NY Times bestseller and the movie money enabled Swarthout to become a professional writer at last. He was 39 years old.\\nHe completed another novel while teaching Honors English at Michigan State. Where the Boys Are (1960) was set on the Michigan State campus and was the first comic novel about the annual \"spring break\" invasion of the beaches of southern Florida by America\\'s college students. MGM\\'s  quick movie version, Where the Boys Are (1960), became the highest-grossing low-budget movie in the studio\\'s history.\\nSwarthout went on to write many more novels, some of which were made into movies. He worked on the screenplay of only one, Cordura, at Columbia Pictures in Los Angeles for six months, before moving from Michigan to Arizona, where he continued to teach English at Arizona State University for four years before retiring to write full time. Many of his novels were set in either Michigan or Arizona, and some used his war experiences.\\nSeveral other works were sold for films that were never made; these include The Eagle and the Iron Cross (Sam Spiegel, 1968) and The Tin Lizzie Troop (Paul Newman, 1977), as well as a number of movie options, now lapsed, on his many stories. Besides a Hopwood Award and a Theatre Guild Award for his one play, Swarthout was twice nominated by his publishers for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (for They Came To Cordura by Random House and Bless The Beasts & Children by Doubleday), he received an O. Henry Prize Short Story nomination (in 1960 for \"A Glass of Blessings\"), a Gold Medal from the National Society of Arts and Letters in 1972, won Spur Awards for Best Western Novel of the Year from the Western Writers of America for The Shootist (1975) and The Homesman, a Wrangler Award for Best Western Novel of 1988 for The Homesman from the Western Heritage Association, and finally the Western Writers\\' Owen Wister Award for Lifetime Achievement at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum (previously known as National Cowboy Hall of Fame) in Oklahoma City in June 1991. The Shootist was the basis of John Wayne\\'s final film in 1976 and has since come to be recognized as a classic Western film and one of the Duke\\'s very best. His British publisher (Secker & Warburg) claimed Swarthout had \"the widest writing range\" of any American novelist. From gunfighting Westerns The Shootist to the first of \"the beach pictures,\" Where the Boys Are, from satires such as The Cadillac Cowboys, to tragedies such as Welcome to Thebes, or his adventure novel about the Pershing Expedition into Mexico, They Came to Cordura, or a mystery/thriller such as Skeletons, even a period romance such as Loveland, or an animal rights/environmental tale such as Bless the Beasts & Children, science fiction was about the only literary genre he did not attempt.\\nGlendon was inducted into the Western Writers Hall of Fame at its convention in Scottsdale, Arizona in 2008. The WWA\\'s Hall of Fame is in the library of the famous Buffalo Bill Museum in Cody, Wyoming.\\nSwarthout, a lifelong smoker, died of emphysema in his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, on September 23, 1992.\\nSwarthout, like most of his contemporaries, was affected by the Great Depression and World War II, which in turn influenced his \\n16 novels, particularly those set in the Midwest. Welcome to Thebes (1962), Loveland (1968), and Pinch Me, I Must Be Dreaming (1994) depict how the problems of adults affect their children, especially youth trying to adapt to an adult world. Although They Came to Cordura (1958) is set in Mexico at the time of the 1916 border dispute with Pancho Villa, its analysis of the nature of courage was influenced by Swarthout\\'s wartime experiences. Teaching freshman honors English classes gave Swarthout insight into the mating rituals of college students on the beaches of Fort Lauderdale during spring break, and his hit Where the Boys Are (1960) definitely presaged the antiwar protests that occurred on American college campuses later in the decade. A Christmas Gift (1977, also known as The Melodeon) is an exception to Glendon\\'s other work in several respects. It suggests a farewell tribute to his Michigan ancestors and his awareness of their tradition of understanding and concern for others.\\nWith the conspicuous exception of A Christmas Gift, all of Swarthout\\'s novels are infused with a sardonic spirit, usually in respect to examples of the cruelty and viciousness of which man is capable. \\nHis greatest bestseller, Bless the Beasts and Children, is a good example of this distinguishing literary trait. Another common theme of his writings is his study of courage, the extraordinary heroism of which otherwise common, ordinary men are sometimes capable, given the right circumstances. In setting free a doomed herd of buffalo, the group of mentally disturbed teenagers in Beasts demonstrates valor during harrowing conditions. The style of Swarthout\\'s writing is fundamentally dispassionate, however, and written in a clear, linear, pictorial style, which is why so many of his stories were adapted easily to film. Swarthout was a great admirer of Somerset Maugham (with whom he studied, along with Ernest Hemingway and Joyce Cary as part of his doctoral thesis in literature) and humorist Charles Portis, who influenced his writing.\\nKathryn (1919-2015),[2] the wife of Glendon and mother of Miles, was a former elementary school teacher for five years at Red Cedar School in East Lansing, Michigan, after earning her master\\'s in education at Michigan State University, and bachelor of arts in English from the University of Michigan.\\nShe co-wrote six young-adult novels with her husband; several of them have been published overseas. Kathryn was a columnist for Woman\\'s Day magazine with her free-form poetry, Lifesavors, which ran in the magazine for over 20 years. Some of these columns were published in a book of the same title by Doubleday in 1982.\\nIn 1962, Glendon and Kathryn established the Swarthout Writing Prizes at Arizona State University, administered by the English Department in Tempe. These six prizes in both poetry and fiction (with a current top prize of $1500 in each category), have grown until they now rank among the five highest awards financially for undergraduate and graduate writing programs given annually at any college or university in America.\\nMiles  (1946-2016)[3] was a screenwriter and author living in Playa Del Rey, California, near the beach and LAX. He received a Writers Guild nomination for Best Adaptation for The Shootist in 1976 (the film starred John Wayne and Lauren Bacall). He had adapted a number of his father\\'s novels into films, among them A Christmas to Remember for CBS in 1978, which starred Joanne Woodward, Jason Robards, and Eva Marie Saint. As a journalist, Miles wrote a Hollywood Western film column for the Western Writers of America\\'s bi-monthly magazine, The Roundup. He won a Stirrup Award from that organization for \"The Duke\\'s Last Ride, the Making of The Shootist,\" the best article to appear in that publication in 1994.\\nMiles Swarthout also wrote several articles for Persimmon Hill, the quarterly magazine of the National Cowboy Hall of Fame, among them \"The Westerns of Glendon Swarthout\" in the special summer issue from 1996, \"Hollywood and the West\", as well as in the sequel to this best-selling issue for spring 2000, \"America\\'s First Cinema Cowboy: William S. Hart\".\\nMiles Swarthout was the plaintiff on an episode of the Judge Judy courtroom television series toward the end of the syndicated show\\'s second season in 1998, whereby he was suing a woman hired as a line producer for a film Swarthout was directing. The woman, Miclaelina Lee, drew from the film\\'s budget to pay for her rent, meals, and to pay various personal bills, and did not prove that Swarthout approved and signed off on those expenditures to Judge Judith Sheindlin\\'s satisfaction. The judgement in the case was in favor of Miles Swarthout in the amount of $1,000.00.\\nMiles edited the only volume of his late father\\'s 14 short stories, Easterns and Westerns, which included an extensive overview of Glendon\\'s literary career. Michigan State University Press published Easterns and Westerns in hardcover in the summer of 2001. Miles Swarthout also wrote The Sergeant\\'s Lady, based upon one of his late father\\'s old short stories, and this new novel won the Spur Award from the Western Writers as the Best First Western Novel of 2004. The Last Shootist, his sequel to his father\\'s novel, was named 2014\\'s Best Western Novel by the editors of True West magazine.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nNigel Tranter OBE (23 November 1909 – 9 January 2000) was a writer of a wide range of books on history and architecture, both fiction and non-fiction. He was best-known for his popular and well-researched historical novels, covering centuries of Scottish history.\\nNigel Tranter was born in Glasgow and educated at George Heriot\\'s School in Edinburgh.[1] He trained as an accountant and worked in Scottish National Insurance Company, founded by his uncle.[2] In 1933, he married May Jean Campbell Grieve and had two children, Frances May and Philip. He joined the Royal Artillery and served in East Anglia in the Second World War.\\nFrom childhood onwards, Tranter took a great interest in castles and their associated history. As a result, in 1935, at age 25, he published his first book, The Fortalices and Early Mansions of Southern Scotland.  Encouraged by his wife, he wrote his first novel, In Our Arms Our Fortune, which was rejected by the publishers. However, Trespass soon followed and was accepted by The Moray Press.  Unfortunately, they went bankrupt soon after its publication in 1937, and he didn\\'t receive any payment.  Over the next few years, he wrote several more novels in the same vein: light-hearted romantic adventures in varied settings from modern-day Europe to historical Scotland. Tranter also wrote several westerns under the pseudonym Nye Tredgold to provide additional income for his family, and a dozen children\\'s books -adventure stories aimed at 8- to 10-year-olds.\\nWar service did not stop Tranter writing, and a number of novels were published during the war years, some inspired by his own experiences.[3]\\nBetween 1962 and 1971 Tranter published the landmark series The Fortified House in Scotland (in five volumes). This attempted to cover the history and structure of every primarily domestic castle in Scotland, 663 buildings in all. A small number of non-domestic buildings associated with priories, churches, communal defence etc. etc. were also included.  Highly regarded at the time, it is still read by those who have an interest in this specialist area.\\nWhile researching the castles, Tranter realised that there were many characters and incidents in Scottish history which could be used as the basis for novels, which he tried to make as accurate as possible – while making no effort to hide his own strong Scottish identity. The Queen\\'s Grace (1953) was his first novel to focus on an historical character (in this case, Mary, Queen of Scots), although it contained a high fictional content.  Two trilogies followed: the MacGregor Trilogy (1957–1962) and the Master of Gray Trilogy (1961–1965).  By this time, Tranter was well established as a writer of serious historical fiction.  The fictional content decreased as he became more experienced, and his later novels were almost entirely composed around the historical record. These novels have gained a wide readership while providing a basic grounding in Scottish history to their readers.\\nAs noted above, Tranter had a lifelong interest in Scottish castles.  Initially intrigued by their architectural history, Tranter soon developed an interest in Scottish history generally.  As he moved into historical novels, his research became deeper until he had amassed vast knowledge of Scotland\\'s history to a very detailed level.  His ability to retell history as a \\'story\\' provided an accessible source for many people.  As well as his novels, this knowledge was translated into such non-fiction works as The Story of Scotland.  Becoming intimate with so much of the historical record, Tranter formed many theories of history, some of which were contrary to established thought. These were presented throughout his books. One example of this is his belief that the stone under the Coronation Chair is not the true Stone of Destiny, but a thirteenth-century fake which he refers to as the Westminster Stone.\\nTranter was involved in many activities outside his writing.  From the 1940s onwards he delivered lectures to private groups and organisations, and, as his writing career developed, he undertook many speaking engagements, including some tours to the USA.  He was also invited to join—or was instrumental in setting up—many committees and community groups, in fields as diverse as Scottish Highlands roads and settlement, wild fowling and Athelstaneford\\'s Flag Fund.\\nHis notable involvements include: the original Scottish Convention, a cross-party pressure group established during the 1940s to encourage devolution (Edinburgh chairman); National Covenant Association; National Forth Road Bridge Committee; Saltire Society (honorary president).\\nFollowing the publication of The Fortified House in Scotland, Tranter was regularly asked for advice on the restoration of many tower houses and castles.  He was closely involved in the restoration of over 60 castles, such as Fa\\'side Castle and Menstrie Castle.\\nHe died on 9 January 2000, aged 90, after contracting flu, in Gullane, where his funeral and burial took place.[4]\\nA final eight novels were published after Tranter\\'s death, the last book Hope Endures appearing in 2005.  According to his daughter these \"were all finished at the time of his death, as he always kept ahead in his writing\".[5]\\nA number of the books produced by Tranter had dust jackets designed by the illustrator Val Biro.\\nTranter claimed each of these books took him six weeks to write.  He sold them outright for £100 each.  They were published under the pseudonym \\'Nye Tredgold\\'.\\n',\n",
       "  'Peter Baptisto Germano (May 17, 1913 – September 20, 1983) was an American author of short stories, novels, and television scripts.  He began his career with short stories.  He wrote articles documenting the Marines in World War II as a combat correspondent.  He wrote novels, most of which were westerns, but also wrote science fiction.  And, as television became ever-present in American culture, Germano wrote numerous television scripts for western, science-fiction, drama, and cartoon series.\\nGermano was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, the eldest of six children. His parents, Italian immigrants from the town of Cigliano, gave him the name Pietro Baptisto Germano, which became Peter B. early in his life. As a young man, he worked several jobs, including as a clerk for the local railroad. It was during his employment at the local train station that he met his wife, Muriel Garant. She was an actress and model, who worked in theater in Cape Cod, but took a job at the railroad station in New Bedford, Massachusetts during World War II. The couple married in February 1943, just before Germano left to serve in the Pacific Theater in World War II. He had a few short stories published in magazines before his tour of duty.[1]\\nAs a war correspondent for the United States Marine Corps, Germano wrote numerous articles that appeared in various newspapers. After the war Peter and Muriel lived in Chicago until he was called to serve in the Korean War in 1950. A few years later, the family settled in Anaheim, California (within walking distance to the newly opened Disneyland). Germano and his wife raised four children, while he began a successful writing career.\\nThroughout his career in the military and his work as a writer, Germano went to college to receive two degrees. With only two years of high school, he attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island from 1946-1950. After his service in the Korean War, Germano transferred to Chapman College in Orange, California in 1956 and received a B. A. in 1959. In 1968, he attended Loyola Marymount University, where he earned his Master of Arts in 1970. From 1971-1973, Germano was a part-time lecturer at Loyola Marymount, where he taught Advanced Writing for Film and Television to graduate students.\\nWith his transition from military to civilian life complete, Germano worked tirelessly on the bulk of his fiction career. He wrote western novels under several pseudonyms, and in the 1950s and 1960s wrote television scripts for several western and science fiction programs.[2]\\nWith a steady career, the family moved in 1966 to a new suburban home in Thousand Oaks, California, located north of Los Angeles in Ventura County. By the 1970s, he had published a science fiction novel, mystery short stories, and western short stories for the Jim Hatfield series in \"Texas Rangers\".\\nGermano collaborated with his wife, Muriel, on several projects. In the 1970s, he became the associate editor of The Californian, the newspaper of the Golden State Mobilehome Owners League. When the editor of the newspaper, Thomas Thompson, retired, Germano and his wife took over as editors; a position which they held for eight years. During this same time period, with grandchildren visiting often, the couple wrote scripts for several animated cartoons televisions series, including The Little Prince.\\nA strong supporter of union labor, Germano was a member of the Writers Guild of America, West. He also held memberships to the Western Writers of America (which published \"The Roundup\" out of the University of Texas at El Paso), the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and the Marine Corps Combat Correspondents Association.\\nGermano died in 1983. When not writing, he hiked the golden hills of California. His ashes were spread in the hills near Thousand Oaks. Memorials for both Peter and Muriel Germano are located in Simi Valley\\'s Assumption Cemetery, the local Catholic cemetery.[3]\\nWritten as Barry Cord\\nWritten as James Kane\\nWritten as Jim Kane\\nWritten as Jack Slade\\nWritten as Jack Bertin\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nSamuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835\\xa0– April 21, 1910),[1] known by the pen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, humorist, and essayist. He was praised as the \"greatest humorist the United States has produced,\"[2] with William Faulkner calling him \"the father of American literature.\"[3] Twain\\'s novels include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884),[4] with the latter often called the \"Great American Novel.\" He also wrote A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\\'s Court (1889) and Pudd\\'nhead Wilson (1894) and cowrote The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today (1873) with Charles Dudley Warner.\\nTwain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for both Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. He served an apprenticeship with a printer early in his career, and then worked as a typesetter, contributing articles to his older brother Orion Clemens\\' newspaper. Twain then became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River, which provided him the material for Life on the Mississippi (1883). Soon after, Twain headed west to join Orion in Nevada. He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise.[5]\\nTwain first achieved success as a writer with the humorous story \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" which was published in 1865; it was based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where Twain had spent some time while he was working as a miner. The short story brought Twain international attention.[6] He wrote both fiction and non-fiction. As his fame grew, Twain became a much sought-after speaker. His wit and satire, both in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and Twain was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty.\\nAlthough Twain initially spoke out in favor of American interests in the Hawaiian Islands, he later reversed his position,[7] going on to become vice president of the American Anti-Imperialist League from 1901 until his death in 1910, coming out strongly against the Philippine-American War and American colonialism.[8][9][10] Twain published a satirical pamphlet, \"King Leopold\\'s Soliloquy\", in 1905 about Belgian atrocities in the Congo Free State.\\nTwain earned a great deal of money from his writing and lectures, but invested in ventures that lost most of it, such as the Paige Compositor, a mechanical typesetter that failed because of its complexity and imprecision. He filed for bankruptcy in the wake of these financial setbacks, but in time overcame his financial troubles with the help of Standard Oil executive Henry Huttleston Rogers. Twain eventually paid all his creditors in full, even though his declaration of bankruptcy meant he was not required to do so. Twain was born shortly after an appearance of Halley\\'s Comet, and predicted that his death would accompany it as well, dying a day after the comet was at its closest to Earth.[11]\\nSamuel Langhorne Clemens was born on November 30, 1835, in Florida, Missouri. He was the sixth of seven children of Jane (née Lampton; 1803–1890), a native of Kentucky, and John Marshall Clemens (1798–1847), a native of Virginia.[12][13]\\nHis parents met when his father, a lawyer called to the bar in Kentucky, tried to help Jane\\'s father and uncle avoid bankruptcy.[14] They were married in 1823.[15] Twain was of English and Scots-Irish descent.[16][17][18][19] Only three of his siblings lived beyond childhood: Orion (1825–1897), Pamela (1827–1904), and Henry (1838–1858). His brother Pleasant Hannibal (1828) died at three weeks of age,[20][21] his sister Margaret (1830–1839) died when Twain was three, and his brother Benjamin (1832–1842) died three years later.[22]\\nWhen he was four, Twain\\'s family moved to Hannibal, Missouri,[23] a port town on the Mississippi River that inspired the fictional town of St.\\xa0Petersburg in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.[24] Slavery was legal in Missouri at the time, and it became a theme in these writings. His father was an attorney and judge who died of pneumonia in 1847, when Twain was only 11.[25] The following year, Twain left school after the fifth grade to become a printer\\'s apprentice.[1] In 1851, he began working as a typesetter, contributing articles and humorous sketches to the Hannibal Journal, a newspaper that Orion owned. When Twain was 18, he left Hannibal and worked as a printer in New York City, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Cincinnati, joining the newly formed International Typographical Union, the printers\\' trade union. Twain educated himself in public libraries in the evenings, finding wider information than at a conventional school.[26]\\nTwain describes his boyhood in Life on the Mississippi, stating that \"there was but one permanent ambition\" among his comrades: to be a steamboatman. \"Pilot was the grandest position of all. The pilot, even in those days of trivial wages, had a princely salary – from a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and no board to pay.\" As Twain described it, the pilot\\'s prestige exceeded that of the captain. The pilot had to \"get up a warm personal acquaintanceship with every old snag and one-limbed cottonwood and every obscure wood pile that ornaments the banks of this river for twelve hundred miles; and more than that, must... actually know where these things are in the dark\". Steamboat pilot Horace E. Bixby took Twain on as a cub pilot to teach him the river between New Orleans and St. Louis for $500 (equivalent to $18,000 in 2023), payable out of Twain\\'s first wages after graduating. Twain studied the Mississippi, learning its landmarks, how to navigate its currents effectively, and how to read the river and its constantly shifting channels, reefs, submerged snags, and rocks that would \"tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated\".[27] It was more than two years before he received his pilot\\'s license. Piloting also gave Twain his pen name from \"mark twain\", the leadsman\\'s cry for a measured river depth of two fathoms (12 feet), which was safe water for a steamboat.[28][29]\\nAs a young pilot, Clemens served on the steamer A. B. Chambers with Grant Marsh, who became famous for his exploits as a steamboat captain on the Missouri River. The two liked and admired each other, and maintained a correspondence for many years after Clemens left the river.[30]\\nWhile training, Samuel convinced his younger brother Henry to work with him, and even arranged a post of mud clerk for him on the steamboat Pennsylvania. On June 13, 1858, the steamboat\\'s boiler exploded; Henry succumbed to his wounds eight days later. Twain claimed to have foreseen this death in a dream a month earlier,[31]:\\u200a275\\u200a which inspired his interest in parapsychology; Twain was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research.[32] Twain was guilt-stricken and held himself responsible for the rest of his life. Twain continued to work on the river and was a river pilot until the Civil War broke out in 1861, when traffic was curtailed along the Mississippi River. \\nAt the start of hostilities, he enlisted briefly in a local Confederate unit, the Marion Rangers as a Second Lieutenant[33]. Twain later wrote the sketch \"The Private History of a Campaign That Failed\", describing how he and his friends had been Confederate volunteers for two weeks before their unit disbanded.[34]\\nTwain then left for Nevada to work for his brother Orion, who was Secretary of the Nevada Territory. Twain describes the episode in his book Roughing It.[35][36]:\\u200a147\\u200a\\nOrion became secretary to Nevada Territory governor James W. Nye in 1861, and Twain joined him when he moved west. The brothers traveled more than two weeks on a stagecoach across the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, visiting the Mormon community in Salt Lake City.[37]\\nTwain\\'s journey ended in the silver-mining town of Virginia City, Nevada, where he became a miner on the Comstock Lode.[34] Twain failed as a miner and went to work at the Virginia City newspaper Territorial Enterprise,[38] working under a friend, the writer Dan DeQuille. Twain first used his pen name here on February 3, 1863, when he wrote a humorous travel account titled \"Letter From Carson\\xa0– re: Joe Goodman; party at Gov.\\xa0Johnson\\'s; music\" and signed it \"Mark Twain\".[39][40]\\nTwain\\'s experiences in the American West inspired Roughing It, written during 1870–71 and published in 1872.[41] His experiences in Angels Camp (in Calaveras County, California) provided material for \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\" (1865).[42][43]\\nTwain moved to San Francisco in 1864, still as a journalist, and met writers such as Bret Harte and Artemus Ward.[44] He may have been romantically involved with the poet Ina Coolbrith.[45]\\nTwain\\'s first success as a writer came when his humorous tall tale \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\" was published on November 18, 1865, in the New York weekly The Saturday Press, bringing him national attention. A year later, Twain traveled to the Sandwich Islands (present-day Hawaii) as a reporter for the Sacramento Union. His letters to the Union were popular and became the basis for his first lectures.[46]\\nIn 1867, local newspapers\\nThe Alta California and New-York Tribune funded Twain\\'s trip to the Mediterranean aboard the Quaker City, including a tour of Europe and the Middle East. He wrote a collection of travel letters which were later compiled as The Innocents Abroad (1869). It was on this trip that Twain met fellow passenger Charles Langdon, who showed him a picture of his sister Olivia. Twain later claimed to have fallen in love at first sight.[47]\\nUpon returning to the United States, Twain was offered honorary membership in Yale University\\'s secret society Scroll and Key in 1868.[48]\\nTwain and Olivia Langdon corresponded throughout 1868. She rejected his first marriage proposal, but Twain continued to court her and managed to overcome her father\\'s initial reluctance.[50] They were married in Elmira, New York in February 1870.[46] She came from a \"wealthy but liberal family\"; through her, Twain met abolitionists, \"socialists, principled atheists and activists for women\\'s rights and social equality\", including Harriet Beecher Stowe, Frederick Douglass, and utopian socialist writer William Dean Howells,[51] who became a long-time friend. The Clemenses lived in Buffalo, New York, from 1869 to 1871. Twain owned a stake in the Buffalo Express newspaper and worked as an editor and writer.[52][49] While they were living in Buffalo, their son Langdon died of diphtheria in 1872 at the age of 19\\xa0months. They had three daughters: Susy (1872–1896), Clara (1874–1962),[53] and Jean (1880–1909). The Clemenses formed a friendship with David Gray, who worked as an editor of the rival Buffalo Courier, and his wife Martha. Twain later wrote that the Grays were \"\\'all the solace\\' he and Livy had during their \\'sorrowful and pathetic brief sojourn in Buffalo\\'\", and that Gray\\'s \"delicate gift for poetry\" was wasted working for a newspaper.[49]\\nStarting in 1873, Twain moved his family to Hartford, Connecticut, where he arranged the building of a home next door to Stowe. In the 1870s and 1880s, the family summered at Quarry Farm in Elmira, the home of Olivia\\'s sister, Susan Crane.[54][55] In 1874,[54] Susan had a study built, an octagonal gazebo, apart from the main house as a surprise to Twain so that he would have a quiet place in which to write and enjoy his cigars.[56][57]\\nTwain wrote many of his classic novels during his 17 years in Hartford (1874–1891) and over 20 summers at Quarry Farm. They include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), The Prince and the Pauper (1881), Life on the Mississippi (1883), Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\\'s Court (1889).[58][59]\\nThe couple\\'s marriage lasted 34 years until Olivia\\'s death in 1904.[60] All of the Clemens family are buried in Elmira\\'s Woodlawn Cemetery.[61][62]\\nTwain was fascinated with science and scientific inquiry. He developed a close and lasting friendship with Nikola Tesla, and the two spent much time together in Tesla\\'s laboratory.[63]\\nTwain patented three inventions, including an \"Improvement in Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments\" (to replace suspenders) and a history trivia game.[64][65] Most commercially successful was a self-pasting scrapbook; a dried adhesive on the pages needed only to be moistened before use.[64] More than 25,000 were sold.[64]\\nTwain was an early proponent of fingerprinting as a forensic technique, featuring it in a tall tale in Life on the Mississippi (1883) and as a central plot element in the novel Pudd\\'nhead Wilson (1894).[66][67]\\nTwain\\'s novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\\'s Court (1889) features a time traveler from the contemporary U.S., using his knowledge of science to introduce modern technology to Arthurian England. This type of historical manipulation became a trope of speculative fiction as alternate histories.[68][69]\\nIn 1909, Thomas Edison visited Twain at Stormfield, his home in Redding, Connecticut and filmed him. Part of the footage was used in The Prince and the Pauper (1909), a two-reel short film. It is the only known existing film footage of Twain.[70]\\nTwain made a substantial amount of money through his writing, but he lost a great deal through investments. Twain invested mostly in new inventions and technology, particularly the Paige typesetting machine. It was considered a mechanical marvel that amazed viewers when it worked, but it was prone to breakdowns. Twain spent $300,000 (equivalent to $9,471,724 in 2023) on it between 1880 and 1894,[71] but before it could be perfected it was rendered obsolete by the Linotype. He lost the bulk of his book profits, as well as a substantial portion of his wife\\'s inheritance.[72]\\nTwain also lost money through his publishing house, Charles L. Webster and Company, which enjoyed initial success selling the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant but failed soon afterward, losing money on a biography of Pope Leo XIII. Fewer than 200 copies were sold.[72]\\nTwain and his family closed down their expensive Hartford home in response to the dwindling income and moved to Europe in June 1891. William M. Laffan of The New York Sun and the McClure Newspaper Syndicate offered him the publication of a series of six European letters. Twain, Olivia, and their daughter Susy were all faced with health problems, and they believed that it would be of benefit to visit European baths.[73]:\\u200a175\\u200a The family stayed mainly in France, Germany, and Italy until May 1895, with longer spells at Berlin (winter 1891–92), Florence (fall and winter 1892–93), and Paris (winters and springs 1893–94 and 1894–95). During that period, Twain returned to New York four times due to his enduring business troubles. Twain rented \"a cheap room\" in September 1893 at $1.50 per day (equivalent to $51 in 2023) at The Players Club, which he had to keep until March 1894; meanwhile, Twain became \"the Belle of New York,\" in the words of biographer Albert Bigelow Paine.[73]:\\u200a176–190\\u200a\\nTwain\\'s writings and lectures enabled him to recover financially, combined with the help of his friend Henry Huttleston Rogers.[74] In 1893, Twain began a friendship with the financier, a principal of Standard Oil, that lasted the remainder of his life. Rogers first made Twain file for bankruptcy in April 1894, then had him transfer the copyrights on his written works to his wife to prevent creditors from gaining possession of them. Finally, Rogers took absolute charge of Twain\\'s money until all his creditors were paid.[73]:\\u200a188\\u200a\\nTwain accepted an offer from Robert Sparrow Smythe[75] and embarked on a year-long around-the-world lecture tour in July 1895[76] to pay off his creditors in full, although Twain was no longer under any legal obligation to do so.[77] It was a long, arduous journey, and he was sick much of the time, mostly from a cold and a carbuncle. The first part of the itinerary took Twain across northern America to British Columbia, Canada, until the second half of August. For the second part, he sailed across the Pacific Ocean. Twain\\'s scheduled lecture in Honolulu, Hawaii, had to be canceled due to a cholera epidemic.[73]:\\u200a188\\u200a[78] Twain went on to Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, India, Mauritius, and South Africa. His three months in India became the centerpiece of his 712-page book Following the Equator. In the second half of July 1896, Twain sailed back to England, completing his circumnavigation of the world begun 14 months before.[73]:\\u200a188\\u200a\\nTwain and his family spent four more years in Europe, mainly in England and Austria (October 1897 to May 1899), with longer spells in London and Vienna. Clara had wished to study the piano under Theodor Leschetizky in Vienna.[73]:\\u200a192–211\\u200a\\nHowever, Jean\\'s health did not benefit from consulting with specialists in Vienna, the \"City of Doctors\".[79] The family moved to London in spring 1899, following a lead by Poultney Bigelow, who had a good experience being treated by Dr. Jonas Henrik Kellgren, a Swedish osteopathic practitioner in Belgravia. They were persuaded to spend the summer at Kellgren\\'s sanatorium by the lake in the Swedish village of Sanna. Coming back in fall, they continued the treatment in London, until Twain was convinced by lengthy inquiries in America that similar osteopathic expertise was available there.[80]\\nIn mid-1900, Twain was the guest of newspaper proprietor Hugh Gilzean-Reid at Dollis Hill House, located on the north side of London. Twain wrote that he had \"never seen any place that was so satisfactorily situated, with its noble trees and stretch of country, and everything that went to make life delightful, and all within a biscuit\\'s throw of the metropolis of the world.\"[81] Twain then returned to America in October 1900, having earned enough to pay off his debts. In winter 1900/01, Twain became his country\\'s most prominent opponent of imperialism, raising the issue in his speeches, interviews, and writings. In January 1901, Twain began serving as vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League of New York.[82][10]\\nTwain was in great demand as a featured speaker, performing solo humorous talks similar to modern stand-up comedy.[83] He gave paid talks to many men\\'s clubs, including the Authors\\' Club, Beefsteak Club, Vagabonds, White Friars, and Monday Evening Club of Hartford.[84][85][86]\\nIn the late 1890s, Twain spoke to the Savage Club in London and was elected an honorary member. He was told that only three men had been so honored, including the Prince of Wales, and Twain replied: \"Well, it must make the Prince feel mighty fine.\"[73]:\\u200a197\\u200a He visited Melbourne and Sydney in 1895 as part of a world lecture tour. In 1897, Twain spoke to the Concordia Press Club in Vienna as a special guest, following the diplomat Charlemagne Tower, Jr. He delivered the speech \"Die Schrecken der Deutschen Sprache\" (\"The Horrors of the German Language\")—in German—to the great amusement of the audience.[36]:\\u200a50\\u200a In 1901, Twain was invited to speak at Princeton University\\'s Cliosophic Literary Society, where he was made an honorary member.[87]\\nIn 1881, Twain was honored at a banquet in Montreal, Canada where he made reference to securing a copyright.[88] In 1883, Twain paid a brief visit to Ottawa,[89] and he visited Toronto twice in 1884 and 1885 on a reading tour with George Washington Cable, known as the \"Twins of Genius\" tour.[89][90][91]\\nThe reason for the Toronto visits was to secure Canadian and British copyrights for Twain\\'s upcoming book Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,[89][91] to which he had alluded in his Montreal visit. The reason for the Ottawa visit had been to secure Canadian and British copyrights for Life on the Mississippi.[89] Publishers in Toronto had printed unauthorized editions of Twain\\'s books at the time, before an international copyright agreement was established in 1891.[89] These were sold in the United States as well as in Canada, depriving him of royalties. Twain estimated that Belford Brothers\\' edition of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer alone had cost him $10,000 (equivalent to $340,000 in 2023).[89] He had unsuccessfully attempted to secure the rights for The Prince and the Pauper in 1881, in conjunction with his Montreal trip.[89] Eventually, Twain received legal advice to register a copyright in Canada (for both Canada and Britain) prior to publishing in the United States, which would restrain the Canadian publishers from printing a version when the American edition was published.[89][91] There was a requirement that a copyright be registered to a Canadian resident; Twain addressed this by his short visits to the country.[89][91]\\nIn his later years, Twain lived at 14 West 10th Street in Manhattan.[94] He passed through a period of deep depression which began in 1896 when his daughter Susy died of meningitis. Olivia\\'s death in 1904 and Jean\\'s on December 24, 1909, deepened Twain\\'s gloom.[1] On May 20, 1909, his close friend Henry Rogers died suddenly.[95]\\nIn April 1906, Twain heard that his friend Ina Coolbrith had lost nearly all that she owned in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and he volunteered a few autographed portrait photographs to be sold for her benefit. To further aid Coolbrith, George Wharton James visited Twain in New York and arranged for a new portrait session. Twain was resistant initially, but he eventually admitted that four of the resulting images were the finest ones ever taken of him.[96] In September, Twain started publishing chapters from his autobiography in the North American Review.[97] The same year, Charlotte Teller, a writer living with her grandmother at 3 Fifth Avenue, began an acquaintanceship with him which \"lasted several years and may have included romantic intentions\" on his part.[98]\\nIn 1906, Twain formed the Angel Fish and Aquarium Club, for girls whom he viewed as surrogate granddaughters. Its dozen or so members ranged in age from 10 to 16. Twain exchanged letters with his \"Angel Fish\" girls and invited them to concerts and the theatre and to play games. Twain wrote in 1908 that the club was his \"life\\'s chief delight\".[36]:\\u200a28\\u200a In 1907, he met Dorothy Quick (then age 11) on a transatlantic crossing, beginning \"a friendship that was to last until the very day of his death\".[99]\\nTwain was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) by Yale University in 1901 and a Doctor of Law by the University of Missouri in 1902. Oxford University awarded him a Doctorate of Law in 1907.[100]:\\u200a52\\u200a:\\u200a58\\u200a\\nTwain was born two weeks after Halley\\'s Comet\\'s closest approach in 1835; he said in 1909:[73]\\nI came in with Halley\\'s Comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don\\'t go out with Halley\\'s Comet. The Almighty has said, no doubt: \"Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together\". Twain\\'s prediction was eerily accurate; he died of a heart attack on April 21, 1910, in Stormfield, one month before the comet passed Earth that year.[101]\\nUpon hearing of Twain\\'s death, President William Howard Taft said:[102][103]\\nMark Twain gave pleasure – real intellectual enjoyment – to millions, and his works will continue to give such pleasure to millions yet to come … His humor was American, but he was nearly as much appreciated by Englishmen and people of other countries as by his own countrymen. He has made an enduring part of American literature.Twain\\'s funeral was at the Brick Presbyterian Church on Fifth Avenue, New York.[104] He is buried in his wife\\'s family plot at Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira, New York. The Langdon family plot is marked by a 12-foot monument (two fathoms, or \"mark twain\") placed there by Twain\\'s surviving daughter Clara.[105] There is also a smaller headstone. He expressed a preference for cremation (for example, in Life on the Mississippi), but he acknowledged that his surviving family would have the last word.\\nOfficials in Connecticut and New York estimated the value of Twain\\'s estate at $471,000 ($11,000,000 in 2023).[106]\\nTwain began his career writing light, humorous verse, but he became a chronicler of the vanities, hypocrisies, and murderous acts of mankind. At mid-career, Twain combined rich humor, sturdy narrative, and social criticism in Huckleberry Finn. He was a master of rendering colloquial speech and helped to create and popularize a distinctive American literature built on American themes and language.\\nMany of Twain\\'s works have been suppressed at times for various reasons. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been repeatedly restricted in American high schools, not least for its frequent use of the word \"nigger\",[107] a slur commonly used for Black people in the nineteenth century.\\nA complete bibliography of Twain\\'s works is nearly impossible to compile because of the vast number of pieces he wrote (often in obscure newspapers) and his use of several different pen names. Additionally, a large portion of Twain\\'s speeches and lectures have been lost or were not recorded; thus, the compilation of his works is an ongoing process. Researchers have rediscovered published material as recently as 1995 and 2015.[72][108]\\nTwain was writing for the Virginia City newspaper the Territorial Enterprise in 1863 when he met lawyer Tom Fitch, editor of the competing newspaper Virginia Daily Union and known as the \"silver-tongued orator of the Pacific\".[109]:\\u200a51\\u200a Twain credited Fitch with giving him his \"first really profitable lesson\" in writing. \"When I first began to lecture, and in my earlier writings,\" Twain later commented, \"my sole idea was to make comic capital out of everything I saw and heard.\"[110] In 1866, he presented his lecture on the Sandwich Islands to a crowd in Washoe City, Nevada.[111][112] Afterwards, Fitch told him:\\nClemens, your lecture was magnificent. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. Never in my entire life have I listened to such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin\\xa0– the unpardonable sin. It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, with a piece of atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced.[110]It was in these days that Twain became a writer of the Sagebrush School; he was known later as its most famous member.[113] Twain\\'s first important work was \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" published in the New York Saturday Press on November 18, 1865. After a burst of popularity, the Sacramento Union commissioned him to write letters about his travel experiences. The first journey that Twain took for this job was to ride the steamer Ajax on its maiden voyage to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii). All the while, he was writing letters to the newspaper that were meant for publishing, chronicling his experiences with humor. These letters proved to be the genesis to Twain\\'s work with the San Francisco Alta California newspaper, which designated him a traveling correspondent for a trip from San Francisco to New York City via the Panama isthmus.\\nOn June 8, 1867, Twain set sail on the pleasure cruiser Quaker City for five months, and this trip resulted in The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims\\' Progress.  In 1872, he published his second piece of travel literature, Roughing It, as an account of his journey from Missouri to Nevada, his subsequent life in the American West, and his visit to Hawaii. The book lampoons American and Western society in the same way that Innocents critiqued the various countries of Europe and the Middle East. Twain\\'s next work was The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today, his first attempt at writing a novel. The book, written with Twain\\'s neighbor Charles Dudley Warner, is also his only collaboration.\\nTwain\\'s next work drew on his experiences on the Mississippi River. Old Times on the Mississippi was a series of sketches published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875 featuring his disillusionment with Romanticism.[114] Old Times eventually became the starting point for Life on the Mississippi.\\nTwain\\'s next major publication was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which draws on his youth in Hannibal. Tom Sawyer was modeled on Twain as a child, with traces of schoolmates John Briggs and Will Bowen.[115][116] The book also introduces Huckleberry Finn in a supporting role, based on Twain\\'s boyhood friend Tom Blankenship.[117]\\nThe Prince and the Pauper was not as well received, despite a storyline that is common in film and literature today. The book tells the story of two boys born on the same day who are physically identical, acting as a social commentary as the prince and pauper switch places. Twain had started Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (which he consistently had problems completing)[118] and had completed his travel book A Tramp Abroad, which describes his travels through central and southern Europe.\\nTwain\\'s next major published work was the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which confirmed him as a noteworthy American writer. Some have called it the first Great American Novel, and the book has become required reading in many schools throughout the United States. Huckleberry Finn was an offshoot from Tom Sawyer and had a more serious tone than its predecessor. Four hundred manuscript pages were written in mid-1876, right after the publication of Tom Sawyer. The last fifth of Huckleberry Finn is subject to much controversy. Some say that Twain experienced a \"failure of nerve,\" as critic Leo Marx puts it. Ernest Hemingway once said of Huckleberry Finn:\\nIf you read it, you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys. That is the real end. The rest is just cheating.Hemingway also wrote in the same essay:\\nAll modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.[119]Near the completion of Huckleberry Finn, Twain wrote Life on the Mississippi, which is said to have heavily influenced the novel.[72] The travel work recounts Twain\\'s memories and new experiences after a 22-year absence from the Mississippi River. In it, he also explains that \"Mark Twain\" was the call made when the boat was in safe water, indicating a depth of two (or twain) fathoms (12 feet or 3.7 metres).\\nMcDowell\\'s cave—now known as Mark Twain Cave in Hannibal, Missouri, and frequently mentioned in Twain\\'s book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer—has \"Sam Clemens\", Twain\\'s real name, engraved on the wall by Twain himself.[120]\\nTwain produced President Ulysses S. Grant\\'s Memoirs through his fledgling publishing house, Charles L. Webster and Company, which he co-owned with Charles L. Webster, his nephew by marriage.[121]\\nAt this time, Twain also wrote \"The Private History of a Campaign That Failed\" for The Century Magazine.[122] This piece detailed his two-week stint in a Confederate militia during the Civil War. Twain next focused on A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\\'s Court, written with the same historical fiction style as The Prince and the Pauper. A Connecticut Yankee shows the absurdities of political and social norms by setting them in the court of King Arthur. The book was started in December 1885, then shelved a few months later until the summer of 1887, and eventually finished in the spring of 1889.[123][124]\\nTwain\\'s next large-scale work was Pudd\\'nhead Wilson, which he wrote rapidly, as he was desperately trying to stave off bankruptcy. From November 12 to December 14, 1893, Twain wrote 60,000 words for the novel.[72] Critics[who?] have pointed to this rushed completion as the cause of the novel\\'s rough organization and constant disruption of the plot. This novel also contains the tale of two boys born on the same day who switch positions in life, like The Prince and the Pauper. It was first published serially in Century Magazine, and when it was finally published in book form, Pudd\\'nhead Wilson appeared as the main title; however, the \"subtitles\" make the entire title read The Tragedy of Pudd\\'nhead Wilson and the Comedy of The Extraordinary Twins.[72]\\nTwain\\'s next venture was a work of straight fiction that he called Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc and dedicated to his wife. Twain said a year before his death that this was the work that he was most proud of, despite the criticism that he received for it, writing: \" I like Joan of Arc best of all my books; and it is the best; I know it perfectly well. And besides, it furnished me seven times the pleasure afforded me by any of the others; twelve years of preparation, and two years of writing. The others needed no preparation and got none.\"[125] The book had been a dream of Twain\\'s since childhood, and he claimed that he had found a manuscript detailing the life of Joan of Arc when Twain was an adolescent.[72] It was written at the time of his bankruptcy and Twain was convinced that it would save his financial disposition. Twain specifically insisted it to be an anonymous publication so that readers would take it as a serious historical account.[126] With the help of his financial adviser Henry Huttleston Rogers, it was published anonymously in serials in the Harper\\'s Magazine in 1895.[127][128]\\nTo pay the bills and keep his business projects afloat, Twain had begun to write articles and commentary furiously, with diminishing returns, but it was not enough. He filed for bankruptcy in 1894. During this time of dire financial straits, Twain published several literary reviews in newspapers to help make ends meet. He famously derided James Fenimore Cooper in his article detailing Cooper\\'s \"Literary Offenses\". Twain became an extremely outspoken critic of other authors and other critics; he suggested that, before praising Cooper\\'s work, Thomas Lounsbury, Brander Matthews, and Wilkie Collins \"ought to have read some of it\".[129]\\nGeorge Eliot, Jane Austen, and Robert Louis Stevenson also fell under Twain\\'s attack during this time period, beginning around 1890 and continuing until his death.[130] Twain outlines what he considers to be \"quality writing\" in several letters and essays, in addition to providing a source for the \"tooth and claw\" style of literary criticism. Twain places emphasis on concision, utility of word choice, and realism; he complains, for example, that Cooper\\'s Deerslayer purports to be realistic but has several shortcomings. Ironically, several of Twain\\'s own works were later criticized for lack of continuity (Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) and organization (Pudd\\'nhead Wilson).[131][132]\\nTwain\\'s wife died in 1904 while the couple were staying at the Villa di Quarto in Florence. After some time had passed, he published some works that his wife, his de facto editor and censor throughout her married life, had looked down upon. The Mysterious Stranger is perhaps the best known, depicting various visits of Satan to earth. This particular work was not published in Twain\\'s lifetime. His manuscripts included three versions, written between 1897 and 1905: the so-called Hannibal, Eseldorf, and Print Shop versions. The resulting confusion led to extensive publication of a jumbled version, and only recently[when?] have the original versions become available as Twain wrote them.[133][134][135]\\nTwain\\'s last work was his autobiography, which he dictated and thought would be most entertaining if he went off on whims and tangents in non-chronological order. Some archivists and compilers have rearranged the biography into a more conventional form, thereby eliminating some of Twain\\'s humor and the flow of the book. The first volume of the autobiography, over 736\\xa0pages, was published by the University of California in November 2010, 100\\xa0years after his death, as Twain wished.[136][137] It soon became an unexpected best-seller,[138] making Twain one of a very few authors publishing new best-selling volumes in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.\\nTwain\\'s works have been subjected to censorship efforts. According to Stuart (2013), \"Leading these banning campaigns, generally, were religious organizations or individuals in positions of influence – not so much working librarians, who had been instilled with that American \"library spirit\" which honored intellectual freedom (within bounds of course)\". In 1905, the Brooklyn Public Library banned both The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer from the children\\'s department because of their language.[139]\\nFor two decades, Twain lived in a house in Hartford, Connecticut (1871–1891), and the American Publishing Company in that city published the first edition of several of his books.[140] The same can be said about a number of New York-based companies, such as Harper & Brothers and his nephew\\'s Charles L. Webster and Company.[140] Other memorable editions were created by The Ash Ranch Press of San Diego and Barry Moser\\'s Pennyroyal Press.[140]\\nTwain\\'s views became more radical as he grew older. In a letter to friend and fellow writer William Dean Howells in 1887, Twain acknowledged that his views had changed and developed over his lifetime, referring to one of his favorite works:\\nWhen I finished Carlyle\\'s French Revolution in 1871, I was a Girondin; every time I have read it since, I have read it differently\\xa0– being influenced and changed, little by little, by life and environment\\xa0... and now I lay the book down once more, and recognize that I am a Sansculotte! And not a pale, characterless Sansculotte, but a Marat.[141][142]Twain was a staunch supporter of technological progress and commerce. He was against welfare measures, because Twain believed that society in the \"business age\" is governed by \"exact and constant\" laws that should not be \"interfered with for the accommodation of any individual or political or religious faction\".[143] He opined that \"there is no good government at all & none possible\".[143] In the opinion of Washington University professor Guy A. Cardwell:\\nBy present standards Mark Twain was more conservative than liberal. He believed strongly in laissez faire, thought personal political rights secondary to property rights, admired self-made plutocrats, and advocated a leadership to be composed of men of wealth and brains. Among his attitudes now more readily recognized as liberal were a faith in progress through technology and a hostility towards monarchy, inherited aristocracy, the Roman Catholic church, and, in his later years, imperialism.[144]Twain wrote glowingly about unions in the river boating industry in Life on the Mississippi, which was read in union halls decades later.[145] He supported the labor movement, especially one of the most important unions, the Knights of Labor.[51] In a speech to them, Twain said:\\nWho are the oppressors? The few: the King, the capitalist, and a handful of other overseers and superintendents. Who are the oppressed? The many: the nations of the earth; the valuable personages; the workers; they that make the bread that the soft-handed and idle eat.[146]Twain further wrote \"Why is it right that there is not a fairer division of the spoil all around? Because laws and constitutions have ordered otherwise. Then it follows that laws and constitutions should change around and say there shall be a more nearly equal division.\"[147]\\nBefore 1899, Twain was largely in favor of imperialism. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, he spoke out strongly in favor of American interests in the Hawaiian Islands.[148] Twain said the war with Spain in 1898 was \"the worthiest\" war ever fought.[149] However, he reversed course in 1899. In the New York Herald, October 16, 1900, Twain describes his transformation and political awakening, in the context of the Philippine–American War, to anti-imperialism:\\nI wanted the American eagle to go screaming into the Pacific\\xa0... Why not spread its wings over the Philippines, I asked myself?\\xa0... I said to myself, Here are a people who have suffered for three centuries. We can make them as free as ourselves, give them a government and country of their own, put a miniature of the American Constitution afloat in the Pacific, start a brand new republic to take its place among the free nations of the world. It seemed to me a great task to which we had addressed ourselves.\\nBut I have thought some more, since then, and I have read carefully the treaty of Paris (which ended the Spanish–American War), and I have seen that we do not intend to free, but to subjugate the people of the Philippines. We have gone there to conquer, not to redeem.\\n\\nIt should, it seems to me, be our pleasure and duty to make those people free, and let them deal with their own domestic questions in their own way. And so I am an anti-imperialist. I am opposed to having the eagle put its talons on any other land.[150][151]During the Boxer Rebellion, Twain said that \"the Boxer is a patriot. He loves his country better than he does the countries of other people. I wish him success.\"[152]\\nFrom 1901, soon after his return from Europe, until his death in 1910, Twain was vice-president of the American Anti-Imperialist League,[154] which opposed the annexation of the Philippines by the United States and had \"tens of thousands of members\".[51] He wrote many political pamphlets for the organization. The Incident in the Philippines, posthumously published in 1924, was in response to the Moro Crater Massacre, in which 600 Moros were killed. Twain wrote: \"In what way was it a battle? It has no resemblance to a battle...We cleaned up our four days\\' work and made it complete by butchering these helpless people.\"[155][156] Many of his neglected and previously uncollected writings on anti-imperialism appeared for the first time in book form in 1992.[154]\\nTwain was critical of imperialism in other countries as well. In Following the Equator, Twain expresses \"hatred and condemnation of imperialism of all stripes\".[51] He was highly critical of European imperialists such as Cecil Rhodes and King Leopold II of Belgium, both of whom attempted to establish colonies on the African continent during the Scramble for Africa.[51] King Leopold\\'s Soliloquy is a political satire about the monarch\\'s private colony, the Congo Free State. Reports of outrageous exploitation and grotesque abuses led to widespread international outcry in the early 1900s, arguably the first large-scale human rights movement. In the soliloquy, the King argues that bringing Christianity to the colony outweighs \"a little starvation\". The abuses against Congolese forced laborers continued until the movement forced the Belgian government to take direct control of the colony.[157][158]\\nDuring the Philippine–American War, Twain wrote a short pacifist story titled The War Prayer, which makes the point that humanism and Christianity\\'s preaching of love are incompatible with the conduct of war. It was submitted to Harper\\'s Bazaar for publication, but on March 22, 1905, the magazine rejected the story as \"not quite suited to a woman\\'s magazine\". Eight days later, Twain wrote to his friend Daniel Carter Beard, to whom he had read the story, \"I don\\'t think the prayer will be published in my time. None but the dead are permitted to tell the truth.\" Because he had an exclusive contract with Harper & Brothers, Twain could not publish The War Prayer elsewhere; it remained unpublished until 1916.[159] It was republished in the 1960s as campaigning material by anti-war activists.[51]\\nTwain acknowledged that he had originally sympathized with the more moderate Girondins of the French Revolution and then shifted his sympathies to the more radical Sansculottes, indeed identifying himself as \"a Marat\" and writing that the Reign of Terror paled in comparison to the older terrors that preceded it.[160] Twain supported the revolutionaries in Russia against the reformists, arguing that the Tsar must be got rid of by violent means, because peaceful ones would not work.[161] He summed up his views of revolutions in the following statement:\\nI am said to be a revolutionist in my sympathies, by birth, by breeding and by principle. I am always on the side of the revolutionists, because there never was a revolution unless there were some oppressive and intolerable conditions against which to revolute.[162] Twain was an adamant supporter of the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of slaves, even going so far as to say, \"Lincoln\\'s Proclamation\\xa0... not only set the black slaves free, but set the white man free also\".[163] He argued that non-whites did not receive justice in the United States, once saying, \"I have seen Chinamen abused and maltreated in all the mean, cowardly ways possible to the invention of a degraded nature\\xa0... but I never saw a Chinaman righted in a court of justice for wrongs thus done to him\".[164] Twain paid for at least one black person to attend Yale Law School and for another black person to attend a southern university to become a minister.[165]\\nTwain was also a supporter of women\\'s suffrage, as evidenced by his \"Votes for Women\" speech, given in 1901.[166]\\nHelen Keller benefited from Twain\\'s support as she pursued her college education and publishing despite her disabilities and financial limitations. The two were friends for roughly 16 years.[167]\\nThrough Twain\\'s efforts, the Connecticut legislature voted a pension for Prudence Crandall, since 1995 Connecticut\\'s official heroine, for her efforts towards the education of young African-American women in Connecticut. Twain also offered to purchase for her use her former house in Canterbury, home of the Canterbury Female Boarding School, but she declined.[168]:\\u200a528\\u200a\\nAt 62, Twain wrote in his travelogue Following the Equator (1897) that in colonized lands all over the world, \"savages\" have always been wronged by \"whites\" in the most merciless ways, such as \"robbery, humiliation, and slow, slow murder, through poverty and the white man\\'s whiskey\"; his conclusion is that \"there are many humorous things in this world; among them the white man\\'s notion that he is less savage than the other savages\".[169] Describing his travels, Twain wrote, \"So far as I am able to judge nothing has been left undone, either by man or Nature, to make India the most extraordinary country that the sun visits on his rounds. Where every prospect pleases, and only man is vile.\"[170]\\n\\nTwain\\'s earlier writings on American Indians reflected his view of essentialized racial difference. Twain wrote in \"The Noble Red Man\" in 1870: His heart is a cesspool of falsehood, of treachery, and of low and devilish instincts. With him, gratitude is an unknown emotion; and when one does him a kindness, it is safest to keep the face toward him, lest the reward be an arrow in the back. To accept of a favor from him is to assume a debt which you can never repay to his satisfaction, though you bankrupt yourself trying. The scum of the earth![171] In the same tract, Twain advocates genocide, describing the \"Noble Aborigine\" as\\xa0:  \"nothing but a poor filthy, naked scurvy vagabond, whom to exterminate were a charity to the Creator\\'s worthier insects and reptiles which he oppresses\"[172]  This piece sought to undermine the sympathy felt on the \"Atlantic seabord\" for Native Americans.[173][174]  In 1895, Twain was still ridiculing the author of Last of the Mohicans, saying in \"Fenimore Cooper\\'s Literary Offenses\" that Cooper \"[...] was almost always in error about his Indians. There was seldom a sane one among them.\"[175]\\nTwain was a Republican for most of his life. However, in 1884, Twain publicly broke with his party and joined the Mugwumps to support the Democratic nominee, Grover Cleveland, over the Republican nominee, James G. Blaine, whom he considered a corrupt politician.[176] Twain spoke at rallies in favor of Cleveland. In the early 20th century, Twain began decrying both Democrats and Republicans as \"insane\" and proposed, in his 1907 book Christian Science, that while each party recognized the other\\'s insanity, only the Mugwumps (that is, those who eschewed party loyalties in favor of voting for \"the best man\") could perceive the overall madness linking the two.[176]\\nTwain was a Presbyterian.[177] He was critical of organized religion and certain elements of Christianity through his later life. For example, Twain wrote, \"Faith is believing what you know ain\\'t so\", and \"If Christ were here now there is one thing he would not be\\xa0– a Christian\".[178] With anti-Catholic sentiment rampant in 19th century America, Twain noted that he was \"educated to enmity toward everything that is Catholic\".[179] As an adult, Twain engaged in religious discussions and attended services, his theology developing as Twain wrestled with the deaths of loved ones and with his own mortality.[180]\\nTwain generally avoided publishing his most controversial[181] opinions on religion in his lifetime, and they are known from essays and stories that were published later. In the essay Three Statements of the Eighties in the 1880s, Twain stated that he believed in an almighty God, but not in any messages, revelations, holy scriptures such as the Bible, Providence, or retribution in the afterlife. Twain did state that \"the goodness, the justice, and the mercy of God are manifested in His works\", but also that \"the universe is governed by strict and immutable laws\", which determine \"small matters\", such as who dies in a pestilence.[182] At other times, he plainly professed a belief in Providence.[183] In some later writings in the 1890s, Twain was less optimistic about the goodness of God, observing that \"if our Maker is all-powerful for good or evil, He is not in His right mind\". At other times, he conjectured sardonically that perhaps God had created the world with all its tortures for some purpose of His own, but was otherwise indifferent to humanity, which was too petty and insignificant to deserve His attention anyway.[184]\\nIn 1901, Twain criticized the actions of the missionary Dr. William Scott Ament (1851–1909) because Ament and other missionaries had collected indemnities from Chinese subjects in the aftermath of the Boxer Uprising of 1900. Twain\\'s response to hearing of Ament\\'s methods was published in the North American Review in February 1901: To the Person Sitting in Darkness, and deals with examples of imperialism in China, South Africa, and with the U.S. occupation of the Philippines.[185] A subsequent article, \"To My Missionary Critics\" published in The North American Review in April 1901, unapologetically continues his attack, but with the focus shifted from Ament to his missionary superiors, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.[186]\\nAfter his death, Twain\\'s family suppressed some of his work that was especially irreverent toward conventional religion, including Letters from the Earth, which was not published until his daughter Clara reversed her position in 1962 in response to Soviet propaganda about the withholding.[187] The anti-religious The Mysterious Stranger was published in 1916. Little Bessie, a story ridiculing Christianity, was first published in the 1972 collection Mark Twain\\'s Fables of Man.[188]\\nTwain raised money to build a Presbyterian Church in Nevada in 1864.[189]\\nTwain created a reverent portrayal of Joan of Arc, a subject over which he had obsessed for forty years, studied for a dozen years and spent two years writing about.[190] In 1900 and again in 1908, Twain stated, \"I like Joan of Arc best of all my books, it is the best\".[190][191]\\nThose who knew Twain well late in life recount that he dwelt on the subject of the afterlife, his daughter Clara saying: \"Sometimes he believed death ended everything, but most of the time he felt sure of a life beyond.\"[192]\\n\\nTwain\\'s frankest views on religion appeared in his final work Autobiography of Mark Twain, the publication of which started in November 2010, 100 years after his death. In it, Twain said:[193]There is one notable thing about our Christianity: bad, bloody, merciless, money-grabbing, and predatory as it is\\xa0– in our country particularly and in all other Christian countries in a somewhat modified degree\\xa0– it is still a hundred times better than the Christianity of the Bible, with its prodigious crime\\xa0– the invention of Hell. Measured by our Christianity of to-day, bad as it is, hypocritical as it is, empty and hollow as it is, neither the Deity nor his Son is a Christian, nor qualified for that moderately high place. Ours is a terrible religion. The fleets of the world could swim in spacious comfort in the innocent blood it has spilled.Twain was a Freemason.[194][195] He belonged to Polar Star Lodge No. 79 A.F.&A.M., based in St. Louis. Twain was initiated an Entered Apprentice on May 22, 1861, passed to the degree of Fellow Craft on June 12, and raised to the degree of Master Mason on July 10.\\n\\nTwain visited Salt Lake City for two days and met there members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They also gave him a Book of Mormon.[196] He later wrote in Roughing It about that book:[197][198]The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the Old Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New Testament.Twain used different pen names before deciding on \"Mark Twain\". He signed humorous and imaginative sketches as \"Josh\" until 1863. Additionally, Twain used the pen name \"Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass\" for a series of humorous letters.[199]\\nTwain maintained that his primary pen name came from his years working on Mississippi riverboats, where two fathoms, a depth indicating water safe for the passage of boat, was a measure on the sounding line. Twain is an archaic term for \"two\", as in \"The veil of the temple was rent in twain.\"[200] The riverboatman\\'s cry was \"mark twain\" or, more fully, \"by the mark twain\", meaning \"according to the mark [on the line], [the depth is] two [fathoms]\"; that is, \"The water is 12 feet (3.7\\xa0m) deep and it is safe to pass.\"\\nTwain said that his famous pen name was not entirely his invention. In Life on the Mississippi, Twain wrote:\\nCaptain Isaiah Sellers was not of literary turn or capacity, but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the river, and sign them \"MARK TWAIN\", and give them to the New Orleans Picayune. They related to the stage and condition of the river, and were accurate and valuable;\\xa0... At the time that the telegraph brought the news of his death, I was on the Pacific coast. I was a fresh new journalist, and needed a nom de guerre; so I confiscated the ancient mariner\\'s discarded one, and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands\\xa0– a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth; how I have succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.[201]Twain\\'s story about his pen name has been questioned by some,[202] with the suggestion that \"mark twain\" refers to a running bar tab that Twain would regularly incur while drinking at John Piper\\'s saloon in Virginia City, Nevada. Samuel Clemens himself responded to this suggestion by saying, \"Mark Twain was the nom de plume of one Captain Isaiah Sellers, who used to write river news over it for the New Orleans Picayune. He died in 1863 and as he could no longer need that signature, I laid violent hands upon it without asking permission of the proprietor\\'s remains. That is the history of the nom de plume I bear.\"[203]\\n\\nIn his autobiography, Twain writes further of Captain Sellers\\'s use of \"Mark Twain\": I was a cub pilot on the Mississippi River then, and one day I wrote a rude and crude satire which was leveled at Captain Isaiah Sellers, the oldest steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River, and the most respected, esteemed, and revered. For many years he had occasionally written brief paragraphs concerning the river and the changes which it had undergone under his observation during fifty years, and had signed these paragraphs \"Mark Twain\" and published them in the St. Louis and New Orleans journals. In my satire I made rude game of his reminiscences. It was a shabby poor performance, but I didn\\'t know it, and the pilots didn\\'t know it. The pilots thought it was brilliant. They were jealous of Sellers, because when the gray-heads among them pleased their vanity by detailing in the hearing of the younger craftsmen marvels which they had seen in the long ago on the river, Sellers was always likely to step in at the psychological moment and snuff them out with wonders of his own which made their small marvels look pale and sick. However, I have told all about this in \"Old Times on the Mississippi.\" The pilots handed my extravagant satire to a river reporter, and it was published in the New Orleans True Delta. That poor old Captain Sellers was deeply wounded. He had never been held up to ridicule before; he was sensitive, and he never got over the hurt which I had wantonly and stupidly inflicted upon his dignity. I was proud of my performance for a while, and considered it quite wonderful, but I have changed my opinion of it long ago. Sellers never published another paragraph nor ever used his nom de guerre again.[204] While Twain is often depicted wearing a white suit, modern representations suggesting that he wore them throughout his life are unfounded. Evidence suggests that Twain began wearing white suits on the lecture circuit, after the death of his wife in 1904. However, there is also evidence showing Twain wearing a white suit before 1904. In 1882, he sent a photograph of himself in a white suit to 18-year-old Edward W. Bok, later publisher of the Ladies Home Journal, with a handwritten dated note. The white suit did eventually become Twain\\'s trademark, as illustrated in anecdotes about this eccentricity (such as the time he wore a white summer suit to a Congressional hearing during the winter).[72] McMasters\\' The Mark Twain Encyclopedia states that Twain did not wear a white suit in his last three years, except at one banquet speech.[205]\\nIn his autobiography, Twain writes of his early experiments with wearing white out-of-season:[206]\\nNext after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, when the summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and comfortable white clothes and enter for the winter into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold up here in the New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid.[206]',\n",

       "  '\\nGerald Robert Vizenor (born 1934) is an American writer and scholar, and an enrolled member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, White Earth Reservation. Vizenor also taught for many years at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was Director of Native American Studies. With more than 30 books published, Vizenor is Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, and Professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico.\\nGerald Vizenor was born to a mother who was Swedish-American[1] and a father who was Anishinaabe. When he was less than two years old, his father was murdered in a homicide that was never solved.[2] He was raised by his mother and paternal Anishinaabe grandmother, along with a succession of paternal uncles, in Minneapolis and on the White Earth Reservation. His mother\\'s partner acted as his informal stepfather and primary caregiver. Following that man\\'s death in 1950, Vizenor lied about his age and at 15 entered the Minnesota National Guard.\\nHonorably discharged before his unit went to Korea, Vizenor joined the army two years later. He served with occupation forces in Japan, with that nation was still struggling to recover from the vast destruction of the nuclear attacks that ended World War II. During this period, he began to learn about the Japanese poetic form of haiku. Later he wrote Hiroshima Bugi (2004), what he called his \"kabuki novel.\"[3]\\nReturning to the United States in 1953, Vizenor took advantage of G.I. Bill funding to complete his undergraduate degree at New York University. He followed this with postgraduate study at Harvard University and the University of Minnesota, where he also undertook graduate teaching. After returning to Minnesota, he married and had a son.\\nAfter teaching at the university, between 1964 and 1968, Vizenor worked as a community advocate. During this time he served as director of the American Indian Employment and Guidance Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which brought him into close contact with numerous Native Americans from reservations. Many found it difficult to live in the city, and struggled against white racism and cheap alcohol.\\nThis period is the subject of his short-story collection Wordarrows: Whites and Indians in the New Fur Trade, some of which was inspired by his experiences. His work with homeless and poor Natives may have been the reason Vizenor looked askance at the emerging American Indian Movement (AIM), seeing radical leaders such as Dennis Banks and Clyde Bellecourt as being more concerned with personal publicity than the \"real\" problems faced by American Indians.[citation needed]\\nVizenor began working as a staff reporter on the Minneapolis Tribune, quickly rising to become an editorial contributor. He investigated the case of Thomas James White Hawk, convicted of a 1967 Vermillion, South Dakota murder and sentenced to death.[4] Vizenor\\'s writings on the case explored the nature of justice in a society dealing with colonized peoples. His work was credited with enabling White Hawk to have his death sentence commuted.[5][6]:\\u200a261\\u200a\\nDuring this period Vizenor coined the phrase \"cultural schizophrenia\" to describe the state of mind of many Natives, who he considered torn between Native and White cultures.[7][8] His investigative journalism into American Indian activists revealed drug dealing, personal failings, and failures of leadership among some of the movement\\'s leaders. As a consequence of his articles, he was personally threatened.\\nBeginning teaching full-time at Lake Forest College, Illinois, Vizenor was appointed to set up and run the Native American Studies program at Bemidji State University. Later he became professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis (1978–1985).[9] He later satirized the academic world in some of his fiction. For example, in \"The Chair of Tears\", in Earthdivers.[6] During this time he also served as a visiting professor at Tianjin University, China.\\nVizenor worked and taught for four years at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he was also Provost of Kresge College. He had an endowed chair for one year at the University of Oklahoma. Vizenor next was appointed as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He is professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico.\\nVizenor was influenced by the French post-modernist intellectuals, particularly Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard.\\nVizenor has published collections of haiku, poems, plays, short stories, translations of traditional tribal tales, screenplays, and many novels. He has been named as a member of the literary movement which Kenneth Lincoln dubbed the Native American Renaissance, a flourishing of literature and art beginning in the mid-20th century.[10]\\nVizenor has written several studies of Native American affairs, including Manifest Manners and Fugitive Poses. He has edited several collections of academic work related to Native American writing. He is the founder-editor of the American Indian Literature and Critical Studies series at the University of Oklahoma Press, which has provided an important venue for critical work on and by Native writers.\\nIn his own studies, Vizenor has worked to deconstruct the semiotics of Indianness. His title, Fugitive Poses is derived from Vizenor\\'s assertion that the term Indian is a social-science construction that replaces native peoples, who become absent or \"fugitive\".[11] Similarly, the term, \"manifest manners,\" refers to the continued legacy of Manifest Destiny. He wrote that native peoples were still bound by \"narratives of dominance\" that replace them with \"Indians\".[12][13] In place of a unified \"Indian\" signifier, he suggests that Native peoples be referred to by specific tribal identities, to be properly placed in their particular tribal context, just as most Americans would distinguish among the French, Poles, Germans and English.\\nIn order to cover more general Native studies, Vizenor suggests using the term, \"postindian,\" to convey that the disparate, heterogeneous tribal cultures were \"unified\" and could be addressed en masse only by Euro-American attitudes and actions towards them. He has also promoted the neologism of \"survivance\", a cross between the words \"survival\" and \"resistance.\" He uses it to replace \"survival\" in terms of tribal peoples. He coined it to imply a process rather than an end, as the ways of tribal peoples continue to change (as do the ways of others). He also notes that the survival of tribal peoples as distinct from majority cultures, is based in resistance.[1]\\nHe continues to criticize both Native American nationalism and Euro-American colonial attitudes.\\nBoth his fiction and academic studies have contributed to his being honored as a major Anishinaabe and American intellectual and writer.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nHarry Milner Whittington[1] (March 3, 1927 – February 4, 2023) was an American lawyer, real estate investor, and political figure. He received international media attention following an incident on February 11, 2006, when he was accidentally shot in the face, neck, and torso by then-United States vice president Dick Cheney while hunting quail with two women on a ranch in Kenedy County, Texas, near Corpus Christi.[2] It was the first time someone had been shot by a sitting vice-president since Alexander Hamilton was shot in a duel by Aaron Burr in 1804.  \\nHarry Milner Whittington was born to Roy and Clara Whittington on March 3, 1927, in Henderson, Texas.[3] He was born in a Democratic family.[4] After attending various local public schools and becoming an Eagle Scout, he attended the University of Texas at Austin in 1944, joining the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. While enrolled in university, he worked in a men\\'s clothing store and as a booking agent for dance bands.[3]\\nAt age 18, during the final months of World War II, he enrolled in the military. He served until the end of the war. Following his time in the military, he resumed his education, graduating from the University of Texas Law school in 1950.[3]\\nWhittington is cited as a critical figure behind Texas\\' shift from being dominated by the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in the latter half of the 20th century.[4][5] Though his parents were Democrats, Whittington, attracted to the Republican party\\'s ideals of smaller government and lower taxes, aligned himself more with the GOP. After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin, he entered into state Republican circles. He managed John Tower\\'s successful 1961 run for the US Senate in Texas, the first successful Republican bid in the state since Reconstruction.[6] He also accompanied future president George H. W. Bush in his failed 1964 bid to become Texas state senator, and financially backed his son, future president George W. Bush, in his 2000 and 2004 election campaigns.[4]\\nOver the years, Whittington had been appointed to several committees and commissions, including the Office of Patient Protection Executive Committee (a committee formed by the governor of Texas to ensure the rights of patients), the Texas Public Finance Authority Board, and the Texas Department of Corrections.[7] In the 1980s, as an appointee of Gov. Bill Clements to the Texas Corrections Board, he was instrumental in bringing about reforms necessary for Texas to comply with a federal court order that found the state\\'s treatment of its prisoners unconstitutional.[8] Whittington was named presiding officer of the Texas Funeral Service Commission after a major shakeup of the agency in 1999. He was appointed by then-Texas Governor George W. Bush and re-appointed in 2002 by Governor Rick Perry.[9]\\nIn 1959, Whittington challenged Austin\\'s involvement in the controversial Federal Urban Renewal Program which enabled the government to seize the property of low-income residents. Following a city council election, Whittington contested the vote in court and after a ten day trial, the election was deemed void by a judge due to the high number of disqualified votes. In 1984, he also legally contested the city over its attempt to enforce invalid ordinances against various downtown properties he owned.[3]\\nIn 2000, Whittington began fighting a legal case involving the eminent domain seizure of a city block of property he owned in Austin. In 2013, after various court proceedings, a Texas district court awarded the title of the property to the city of Austin and ordered the city to pay Whittington $10,500,000 in compensation for the property.[10][11]\\nOn February 11, 2006, Whittington was accidentally shot by then-United States vice president Dick Cheney during a quail hunting trip, at a ranch in south Texas. Most of the damage from the shotgun blast was to the right side of his body, including damage to his face, neck, and chest, causing a collapsed lung. He was taken to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital by ambulance and put into intensive care. The accident was not announced in the news media until the White House confirmed the incident to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times approximately 12 hours after the incident.[12]\\nOn February 14, some of the lead birdshot lodged in Whittington\\'s heart caused a minor heart attack.[13][14] Doctors did not remove all the pellets from Whittington\\'s body. They estimated that there were \"less than 150 or 200\" pellets lodged in his body immediately after the shooting,[15] and about 30 pieces of shot were expected to remain inside him for the rest of his life.[14] On February 17, Whittington made a public statement: \"We all assume certain risks in whatever we do.

       "  '\\nOwen Wister (July 14, 1860\\xa0– July 21, 1938) was an American writer and historian, considered the \"father\" of western fiction.[1] He is best remembered for writing The Virginian and a biography of Ulysses S. Grant.[2]\\nOwen Wister was born on July 14, 1860,[3] in Germantown, a neighborhood in the northwestern part of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[4]  His father, Owen Jones Wister, was a wealthy physician raised at Grumblethorpe in Germantown.[5]  He was a distant cousin of Sally Wister through his descent from John Wister (born Johannes Wüster) (1708–1789), brother of Caspar Wistar. His mother, Sarah Butler Wister, was the daughter of Fanny Kemble, a British actress, and Pierce Mease Butler. Pierce Mease Butler, heir to a fabulous fortune, was a notorious profligate, gambler, and slaveowner. In 1906 Wister wrote a novel, Lady Baltimore, glorifying plantation life. His friend and Harvard classmate, Theodore Roosevelt, wrote to him criticizing the Southern bias of the novel.[6]\\nWister briefly attended schools in Switzerland and Britain,[7] and later studied at St. Paul\\'s School in Concord, New Hampshire and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[8] where he was a member of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals,[9] and a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon (Alpha chapter).[10] Wister was also a member of the Porcellian Club, through which he became lifelong friends with future 26th President Theodore Roosevelt. As a senior Wister wrote the Hasty Pudding\\'s then most successful show, Dido and Aeneas, whose proceeds aided in the construction of their theater. Wister graduated from Harvard in 1882.\\nAt first he aspired to a career in music and spent two years studying at a Paris conservatory. Thereafter, he worked briefly in a bank in New York before studying law; he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1888. Following this, he practiced with a Philadelphia firm but was never truly interested in that career. He was interested in politics, however, and was a staunch supporter of U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt.\\nHarvard\\'s Board of Overseers had Theodore Roosevelt as a member in 1916 and Owen Wister as a member in 1918.[11]\\nIn the 1930s, Wister opposed President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal.\\nWister began his literary work in 1882, publishing The New Swiss Family Robinson, a parody of the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson. It was so well received that Mark Twain wrote a letter to Wister praising it.[12]\\nWister had spent several summers in the American West, making his first trip to the Territory of Wyoming in 1885, planning to shoot big game, fish trout, meet the Indians, and spend nights in the wild. Like his friend Teddy Roosevelt, Wister was fascinated with the culture, lore and terrain of the region. He was \"...struck with wonder and delight, had the eye to see and the talent to portray the life unfolding in America. After six journeys [into the dying \\'wild west\\'] for pleasure, he gave up the profession of law...\",[citation needed] and became the writer he is better known as. On an 1893 visit to Yellowstone National Park, Wister met the western artist Frederic Remington, who remained a lifelong friend.\\nWhen he started writing, Wister naturally inclined towards fiction set on the western frontier. His most famous work remains the 1902 novel The Virginian, a complex mixture of persons, places and events dramatized from experience, word of mouth, and his own imagination\\xa0– ultimately creating the archetypal cowboy, who is a natural aristocrat, set against a highly mythologized version of the Johnson County War, and taking the side of the large landowners. This is widely regarded as being the first cowboy novel, though many modern scholars argue that this distinction belongs to Emma Ghent Curtis\\'s The Administratrix, published over ten years earlier.[13] The Virginian was reprinted fourteen times in eight months. It stands as one of the top 50 best-selling works of fiction and is considered by Hollywood experts to be the basis for the modern fictional cowboy portrayed in literature, film, and television.[citation needed]\\nIn 1904 Wister collaborated with Kirke La Shelle on a successful stage adaptation of The Virginian that featured Dustin Farnum in the title role.[14] Farnum reprised the role ten years later in Cecil B. DeMille\\'s film adaptation of the play.[15]\\nWister was a member of several literary societies, a member of The Franklin Inn Club, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the Board of Overseers of Harvard University.[16] He was also an elected member of the American Philosophical Society.[17]\\nIn 1898, Wister married Mary Channing, his second cousin.[18] The couple had six children. Mary died during childbirth in 1913.[19]  Their daughter, Mary Channing Wister, married artist Andrew Dasburg in 1933.[20]\\nIn 1938, Wister died at his home in Saunderstown, Rhode Island. He is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.[21]\\nIn 1976, Wister was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.[22]\\nSince 1978, University of Wyoming Student Publications has published the literary and arts magazine Owen Wister Review. The magazine was published bi-annually until 1996 and became an annual publication in the spring of 1997.[citation needed]\\nMount Wister, just within the western boundary of the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, is named for him.[23]\\nNear a house that Wister built near La Mesa, California, but never occupied due to his wife\\'s death, is a street called Wister Drive. In the same neighborhood are Virginian Lane and Molly Woods Avenue (named for a character in The Virginian). All of those streets were named by Wister himself.[24][25]\\nThe most popular legend of the Lady Baltimore cake is that Alicia Rhett Mayberry, a Southern belle, baked and served the cake to Wister in Charleston, South Carolina. Wister was said to have been so enamored with the cake that he used it as the namesake of his novel, Lady Baltimore.[26][27][28]\\nMany movie industry historians will agree that most, if not all, westerns can be claimed to contain influences from The Virginian. It is nearly universally accepted that the \"Hollywood cowboy\" was, and still is, based on this book.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nWestern fiction is a genre of literature set in the American Old West frontier and typically set from the late eighteenth to the late nineteenth century.[1] Well-known writers of Western fiction include Zane Grey from the early 20th century and Louis L\\'Amour from the mid-20th century.[2][3] The genre peaked around the early 1960s, largely due to the popularity of televised Westerns such as Bonanza. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside a few west American states, only carry a small number of Western fiction books.\\nThe predecessor of the Western in American literature emerged early with tales of the frontier. The most famous of the early 19th-century frontier novels were James Fenimore Cooper\\'s five novels comprising the Leatherstocking Tales. Cooper\\'s novels were largely set in what was at the time the American frontier: the Appalachian Mountains and areas west of there. As did his novel The Prairie (1824), most later westerns would typically take place west of the Mississippi River.[4]\\nThe notable writer Washington Irving was inspired by Cooper and wrote tales of the American frontier beginning with A Tour on the Prairies which related his recent travels on the frontier. In 1834, he was approached by fur magnate John Jacob Astor, who convinced him to write a history of his fur trading colony in Astoria, Oregon. Irving made quick work of Astor\\'s project, shipping the fawning biographical account Astoria in February 1836.\\nThe Western as a specialized genre got its start in the \"penny dreadfuls\" and later the \"dime novels\".[5] Published in June 1860, Malaeska; the Indian Wife of the White Hunter is considered the first dime novel.[6] These cheaply made books were hugely successful and capitalized on the many stories that were being told about the mountain men, outlaws, settlers, and lawmen who were taming the western frontier. Many of these novels were fictionalized stories based on actual people, such as Billy the Kid, Buffalo Bill, Wyatt Earp (who was still alive at the time), Wild Bill Hickok, and Jesse James.\\nBy 1900, the new medium of pulp magazines helped to relate these adventures to easterners. Meanwhile, non-American authors, like the German Karl May, picked up the genre, went to full novel length, and made it hugely popular and successful in continental Europe from about 1880 on, though they were generally dismissed as trivial by the literary critics of the day.[7] One of the most famous pulp works of the era was Johnston McCulley\\'s first Zorro novel, The Curse of Capistrano (1919).\\nPopularity grew with the publication of Owen Wister\\'s novel The Virginian (1902) and especially Zane Grey\\'s Riders of the Purple Sage (1912). The first Hopalong Cassidy stories by Clarence Mulford appeared in 1904, both as dime novels and in pulp magazines. When pulp magazines exploded in popularity in the 1920s, Western fiction greatly benefited (as did the author Max Brand, who excelled at the western short story). Pulp magazines that specialised in Westerns include Cowboy Stories, Ranch Romances, Star Western, West, and Western Story Magazine.[8] The simultaneous popularity of Western movies in the 1920s also helped the genre.\\nIn the 1940s several seminal Westerns were published, including The Ox-Bow Incident (1940) by Walter van Tilburg Clark, The Big Sky (1947) and The Way West (1949) by A.B. Guthrie Jr., and Shane (1949) by Jack Schaefer. Many other Western authors gained readership in the 1950s, such as Ray Hogan, Louis L\\'Amour, and Luke Short.\\nThe genre peaked around the early 1960s, largely due to the tremendous number of Westerns on television. The burnout of the American public on television Westerns in the late 1960s seemed to have an effect on the literature as well, and interest in Western literature began to wane.[citation needed] In 1968 Charles Portis published True Grit, which became the most successful work of the era.\\nWestern novels, films and pulps gave birth to Western comics, which were very popular, particularly from the late 1940s until c.\\u20091967, when the comics began to turn to reprints. This can particularly be seen at Marvel Comics, where Westerns began c.\\u20091948 and thrived until 1967, when one of their flagship titles, Kid Colt Outlaw (1949–1979), ceased to have new stories and entered the reprint phase. Other notable long-running Marvel Western comics included Rawhide Kid (1955–1957, 1960–1979) Two-Gun Kid (1948–1962), and Marvel Wild Western (1948–1957).\\nDC Comics published the long-running series All-Star Western (1951–1961) and Western Comics (1948–1961), and Charlton Comics published Billy the Kid (1957–1983) and Cheyenne Kid (1957–1973). Magazine Enterprises\\' Straight Arrow ran from 1950 to 1956, and Prize Comics\\' Prize Comics Western ran from 1948 to 1956.\\nFawcett Comics published a number of Western titles, including Hopalong Cassidy from 1948 to 1953. They also published comics starring actors known for their Western roles, including Tom Mix Western (1948–1953) and Gabby Hayes Western (1948–1953). Similarly, Dell Comics published Roy Rogers comics from 1948 to 1961, and Magazine Enterprises published Charles Starrett as the Durango Kid from 1949 to 1955.\\nThe Franco-Belgian comic-series Lucky Luke by Morris (cartoonist) and  René Goscinny is one of the most famous and estimated Western-comics in Europe.\\nThe popular Western comic strip Red Ryder was syndicated in hundreds of American newspapers from 1938 to 1964.\\nIn the 1970s, the work of Louis L\\'Amour began to catch hold of most western readers and he has dominated the western reader lists ever since.[citation needed] George G. Gilman also maintained a cult following for several years in the 1970s and 1980s.[citation needed] Larry McMurtry\\'s and Cormac McCarthy\\'s works remain notable. Specifically, McMurtry\\'s Lonesome Dove and McCarthy\\'s Blood Meridian (both published in 1985) are recognized as major masterpieces both within and beyond the genre. Elmer Kelton, mostly noted for his novels The Good Old Boys and The Time it Never Rained, was voted by the Western Writers of America as the \"Best Western Writer of All Time\". Early in the 1970s Indiana novelist Marilyn Durham wrote two popular Western novels, The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing and Dutch Uncle.\\nWestern readership as a whole began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s.[citation needed] A partial exception was an innovation,[citation needed] the so-called \"adult western\". As Robert J. Randisi puts it, \"it\\'s a western novel with sex in it. That\\'s right, the cowboy has sex with women. A new idea? Probably not, but heretofore this had not been seen in western novels (certainly not by Max Brand, Zane Grey, Owen Wister or Louis L\\'Amour). What these books actually showed was that men and women really did have sex in the old west. (Back when I started the series a rigidly traditional western writer of my acquaintance insisted to me that \"women did not have orgasms in the old west.\").\"[9]\\nReadership of western fiction reached a new low in the first decade of the twenty-first century, and most bookstores, outside a few western states, only carry a small number of Western fiction books. Nevertheless, several Western fiction series are published monthly, such as The Trailsman, Slocum, Longarm and The Gunsmith; these are all \"adult westerns\". Canadian author Guy Vanderhaeghe wrote a trilogy of Western novels: The Englishman\\'s Boy, The Last Crossing, and A Good Man. Other more recent Western authors include Ivan Doig and William Kittredge. The genre has seen the rumblings of a revival, and 2008 saw the publication of an all-Western short story magazine Great Western Fiction which was published by Dry River Publishing in Colorado. Nevertheless, the magazine was short-lived and folded after only two issues.[10] One of the most successful Western novels in recent times was The Sisters Brothers (2011) by Patrick deWitt.\\nWestern authors are represented by the Western Writers of America, who present the annual Spur Awards and Owen Wister Award for Lifetime Achievement. The organization was founded in 1953 to promote the literature of the American West. While the founding members were mostly western fiction writers, the organization began getting a number of other members from other backgrounds such as historians, regional history buffs, and writers from other genres.\\nWestern Fictioneers, founded in 2010, is a professional writers\\' group that encourages and promotes the traditional Westerns. It is the only professional writers\\' organization composed entirely of authors who have written Western fiction. Fans of the genre may join as patron members. The Western Fictioneers\\' annual Peacemakers competition awards prizes in many categories of Western writing.[11]\\n',\n",
       "  'The Western is a film genre defined by the American Film Institute as films which are \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle, and the demise of the new frontier.\"[1] Generally set in the American frontier between the California Gold Rush of 1849 and the closing of the frontier in 1890,[2]:\\u200a557\\u200a the genre also includes many examples of stories set in locations outside the frontier – including Northern Mexico, the Northwestern United States, Alaska, and Western Canada – as well as stories that take place before 1849 and after 1890. Western films comprise part of the larger Western genre, which encompasses literature, music, television, and plastic arts.\\nWestern films derive from the Wild West shows that began in the 1870s.[3]:\\u200a48\\u200a Originally referred to as \"Wild West dramas\", the shortened term \"Western\" came to describe the genre.[4]  Although other Western films were made earlier, The Great Train Robbery (1903) is often considered to mark the beginning of the genre.[2][5] Westerns were a major genre during the silent era (1894–1929) and continued to grow in popularity during the sound era (post–1929). \\nThe genre reached its pinnacle between 1945 and 1965 when it comprised roughly a quarter of studio output.[6] The advent of color and widescreen during this era opened up new possibilities for directors to portray the vastness of the American landscape.[3]:\\u200a105\\u200a This era also produced the genre\\'s most iconic figures, including John Wayne and Randolph Scott, who developed personae that they maintained across most of their films.[7] Director John Ford is often considered one of the genre\\'s greatest filmmakers.[8]\\nWith the proliferation of television in the 1960s, television Westerns began to supersede film Westerns in popularity.[9] By the end of the decade, studios had mostly ceased to make Westerns. Despite their dwindling popularity during this decade, the 1960s gave rise to the revisionist Western, several examples of which became vital entries in the canon.[10]\\nSince the 1960s, new Western films have only appeared sporadically. Despite their decreased prominence, Western films remain an integral part of American culture and national mythology.[11][12]\\nThe American Film Institute defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle, and the demise of the new frontier\".[1]  The term \"Western\", used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in Motion Picture World magazine.[13]\\nMost of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular Western fiction, and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.[14][page\\xa0needed]  Film critic Philip French has said that the Western is \"a commercial formula with rules as fixed and immutable as the Kabuki Theater.\"[15]:\\u200a12\\u200a\\nWestern films commonly feature protagonists such as sheriffs, cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as seminomadic wanderers who wear Stetson hats, bandannas, spurs, and buckskins, use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.[16]\\nFilm Westerns derive from the Wild West shows that began in the 1870s.[3]:\\u200a48\\u200a These shows, which included stage plays and outdoor exhibitions, culminated in Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West, a touring performance that ran from 1883 to 1913. Wild West shows, which were intended for urban audiences, established many of the elements that came to define Western films, such as the blending of fact and fiction and the romanticization of the frontier.[17] These early films were originally referred to as \"Wild West dramas\", the term \"Western\" came to describe the genre. The use of this shortened term appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in Motion Picture World magazine.[4]\\nThe first films that belong to the Western genre are a series of short single reel silents made in 1894 by Edison Studios at their Black Maria studio in West Orange, New Jersey. These featured veterans of Buffalo Bill\\'s Wild West show exhibiting skills acquired by living in the Old West – they included Annie Oakley (shooting) and members of the Sioux (dancing).[18]\\nWestern films were enormously popular in the silent-film era (1894–1927). The earliest known Western narrative film is the British short Kidnapping by Indians, made by Mitchell and Kenyon in Blackburn, England, in 1899.[19][20] The Great Train Robbery (1903, based on the earlier British film A Daring Daylight Burglary), Edwin S. Porter\\'s film starring Broncho Billy Anderson, is often erroneously cited as the first Western, though George N. Fenin and William K. Everson point out that the \"Edison company had played with Western material for several years prior to The Great Train Robbery\". Nonetheless, they concur that Porter\\'s film \"set the pattern—of crime, pursuit, and retribution—for the Western film as a genre\".[21] The film\\'s popularity opened the door for Anderson to become the screen\\'s first Western star; he made several hundred Western film shorts. So popular was the genre that he soon faced competition from Tom Mix and William S. Hart.[22]\\nWith the advent of sound in 1927–28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,[23] leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as Dodge City starring Errol Flynn, Jesse James with Tyrone Power, Union Pacific with Joel McCrea, Destry Rides Again featuring James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich, and especially John Ford\\'s landmark Western adventure Stagecoach  starring John Wayne, which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, Stagecoach made John Wayne a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B Westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen 10 years earlier as the leading man in director Raoul Walsh\\'s spectacular widescreen The Big Trail, which failed at the box office in spite of being shot on location across the American West, including the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and the giant redwoods, due in part to exhibitors\\' inability to switch over to widescreen during the Great Depression.\\nAfter the renewed commercial successes of the Western in the late 1930s, their popularity continued to rise until the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.[24]\\nThe period from 1940 to 1960 has been called the \"Golden Age of the Western\".[25] It is epitomized by the work of several prominent directors including:\\nThere have been several instances of resurgence for the Western genre. According to Netflix, the popularity of the genre is due to its malleability: \"As America has evolved, so too have Westerns.\"[26]\\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Spaghetti Westerns from Italy became popular worldwide; this was due to the success of Sergio Leone\\'s storytelling method.[27][28]\\nAlthough experiencing waning popularity during the 1980s, the success of films such as Dances with Wolves (1990) and Unforgiven (1992) brought the genre back into the mainstream.[26] Back to the Future Part III (1990) was \"a full-blown Western\" set in 1885; although the least commercially successful of the trilogy and according to some a departure from the 1985 original (a sci-fi) and the 1989 sequel (an action adventure), Part III has been regarded by others as a fitting end to the series.[29]\\nAt the turn of the 21st century, Westerns have once again seen an ongoing revival in popularity.[30][31] Largely influenced by the recapturing of Americana mythology, appreciation for the vaquero folklore within Mexican culture and the US Southwest, interest in the Western lifestyle\\'s music and clothing, along with popular videos games series such as Red Dead.[32][33][34][35]\\nScreenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies Western films as one of eleven super-genres in his screenwriters\\' taxonomy, claiming that all feature length narrative films can be classified by these super-genres. The other ten super-genres are action, crime, fantasy, horror, romance, science fiction, slice of life, sports, thriller, and war.[36]\\nWestern films often depict conflicts with Native Americans. While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the Native Americans as dishonorable villains,[37] the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.[38]  Other recurring themes of Westerns include treks (e.g. The Big Trail)[39] or perilous journeys (e.g. Stagecoach)[40] or groups of bandits terrorizing small towns such as in The Magnificent Seven.[41]\\nThe Western goes beyond simply a cinematic genre, and extends into defining the myth of the West in American culture.[15]:\\u200a21–22\\u200a\\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, or Wyoming. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains, and epic canyons.[42] Productions were also filmed on location at movie ranches.[43]\\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film.[42] After the early 1950s, various widescreen formats such as Cinemascope (1953) and VistaVision used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular western landscapes.[44][45] John Ford\\'s use of Monument Valley as an expressive landscape in his films from Stagecoach to Cheyenne Autumn (1965), \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".[46]\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nCowboy culture is the set of behaviors, preferences, and appearances associated with (or resulting from the influence of) the attitudes, ethics, and history of the American cowboy.[1] The term can describe the content or stylistic appearance of an artistic representation, often built on romanticized impressions of the wild west, or certain aspects of people's lifestyle, such as their choices in recreation (including enjoyment of Western movies and music), apparel, and western or southwestern cuisine.\\n\\nThe origins of cowboy culture go back to the Spanish vaqueros who settled in New Mexico and later Texas bringing cattle.[2] By the late 1800s, one in three cowboys were Mexican and brought to the lifestyle its iconic symbols of hats, bandanas, spurs, stirrups, lariat, and lasso.[3] With westward movement brought many distinct ethnicities all with their own cultural traditions. Welsh Americans, as one example, had a history in Wales of cattle and sheep droving, that incorporated well into ranch work.[4]In the late 19th century, folk tales about cowboys and attempts to commercialize on cowboy life by selling exaggerated ideas of it in novels and fashion became popular.[5]\\nBeginning in the 1860s, dime novels began sharing erroneous and highly romanticized tales of the West, feeding the public's interest in the trade and life West of the Mississippi.[6]\\n\\nThroughout the 20th century, radio, film and television had a profound effect on the fashion and mannerisms that built the foundation of what it meant to be living a western lifestyle, however most of this was more Hollywood glitz and glamour than historical narrative.[7] In the 1980s, following the urbanization of much of the Texas population, there was a marked revival of cowboy culture with the creation of a number of organizations devoted to its preservation, among them the American Cowboy Culture Association.[8]\\nThe following is a list of notable people who lived or are living a western lifestyle post to its technological and societal change at the beginning of the 20th century. This list does not include those of whom lived during the 19th century who were living in what was considered the Old West and preoccupied with the western norms of the day.\\nTo be included in this list, the person must be notable and either have a Wikipedia article showing they were or are influenced by the western lifestyle or must have references showing their claim.
